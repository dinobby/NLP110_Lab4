"I was hoping that the revamp would make Radio Cafe on par with its sibling across the street (LGO).   I am sorry to say, NO.  \nThe menu to split between sushi and what they call bar food.  The sushi was good but not great and the bar food was not really bar food.  \n\nMy wife and i split the following:\nBar Food:\nEDAMAME - good, this is hard to mess up\nRADIO CHOPPED SALAD - the best thing i eat, no protein and expensive\nRAISINBREAD GRILLED CHEESE - sounds a bit strange but somehow is all does work together (in a a odd type of way)\n\nSushi:\nSPICY TUNA - good tuna, very dry rice\nSWEET POTATO - to sweet and the texture was just all soft",1
"I'm a regular customer and I have been coming here for over 2 years. I always order the Kalbi soup and I've noticed that every time I order it, the portions get smaller. Not only the cost of food  increased, the quality of food declined too. They also charge if I want more veggies on the side which I'm sure doesn't cost much to make. I was so disappointed today that I was served bones and two pieces of meat holding on for its dear life and I'm not even exaggerating! I'd rather drive myself to china town and get all you can eat for a couple bucks more.",1
"Incredible donuts! Not too sweet like Krispy Kreme, better tasting varieties than Dunkin and great service! The people are super nice and friendly. I go out of my way for this place, it's worth it!",4
3 of us were planning to go to burger bar inside mandalay bay.  but we missed the exit as there was construction and somehow ended up on the 215....and when we got off we saw Chicken Bonz....  So instead of fighting the traffic onto the strip we decided to try it out.\n\nPrice wasn't too bad...all you can eat wings for like $13.  I had the garlic parmesan which seemed a little bland.  Then I tried the Hot Wings...and it was kind of spicy....not too bad.  The ranch was a bit watery...\n\nAs the others mentioned these are the big wing versions.....so you get a lot of meat.  I personally prefer the small crispy kind...\n\nFor the price it isn't bad....but it just didnt do it for me....,2
"\""Your Mama Wants You to Eat at Jimmy John's!\"" - MOTTO #1\n\""Fresh. Fast. Tasty.\"" - MOTTO #2\n\nI can attest to MOTTO #2.  \n\nx Fresh: Vegetables and Meat.\n\nx Fast: On my last visit, my sandwich was handed to me the second I obtained my receipt from the cashier. No joke!\n\nx Tasty: Consistency! The bread is made of crack mix! Their homemade bread which I see the employees make from fresh dough is incredibly tasty!  Its nothing like you ever had, seriously!\n\nMy favorites are the:\n\n#2 Big John (Medium rare roast beef with simple lettuce, tomatoes, and mayo) \n\n#3 Totally Tuna (House made tuna, celery, onions, tasty sauce, alfalfa sprouts, cucumber, lettuce, and tomatoes)\n\nOf the 2, I really dig the Tuna! So Taaasty! \n\nTheir $1 Oatmeal Cookie is pretty good, moist and chewy.\n\nSubway v Jimmy Johns, Hmmmm? It's a tough call to make, both have their PROs and CONs.  The major difference is at Jimmy's, you have no choice in building your toppings or option to toast sandwich.",3
"Totally so so. I supposed this is a staple of the Burgh but I don't think I've been here before. The food was literally average quality. I had an OK burger and the fish sandwich looks like the same one everywhere else has. My mum had the mac&cheese which looked great, and I was impressed by the seasonal craft beer selection.  Other than that, it is very average and there are way yummier places nearby to have lunch.",2
"This restaurant screams expensive with decked out lighted floors, gorgeous lighting and a lovely dinning room. However it is not as great as the ambience it tries to provide. I ordered a filet mignon and I think it was good but not amazing. The salad I had with Artichoke to start was good. The mixed drink I ordered was so so. I had to add honey since I didn't think it was sweet enough. The staff is very attentive and the portions are huge. Expect to pay $100 a person if you all get a starter, entree, drink, and share a dessert. I found the potatoes au gratin to be terrible. Way too cheezy I almost died. The spinach side was okay but sour. I would come back but skip the butter cafe, the mixed drink, and coffee. Also it is $6 to valet which I find to be not horrible since parking at Scottsdale Quarter is hard to find.",2
"This is the worst Toxic Hell I have ever been to so that is saying something.\n\nI ordered a Diet Pepsi and a Mexican Pizza. The soda tasted like the line or nozzle hadn't been clean in, well, EVER. And the pizza was thrown into the box with contents hanging out and getting on the bag and napkin. I was hungry so I started eating it anyway. It tasted like plastic. Seriously. I couldn't eat it.\n\nI went from starving to no appetite in the matter of a few seconds.\n\nIt was that bad.\n\nIf this location shared their secrets to corporate, they'd make millions off of the Taco Bell Diet: \""Try our food and lose your stomach! Literally!\u2122\""",0

"I have had the opportunity to visit Kona Grill as a person on vacation from the small town of Ellensburg, Washington.  Just to be clear, Ellensburg is very small and has limited dining opportunities.  HOWEVER, all of my experiences in my small town GREATLY exceed my dining experience at KONA SUCK.  My friend and I went for happy hour.  We received a watered down margarita (I ordered a second shot and it was still awful and a sad Tisdale cab, let's clarify that this is a bottom-shelf wine from Fred Meyer!).  Disgusting.  Then we received a sad tuna roll with stale and chewy seaweed, and perhaps more disappointingly, a \""chicken and shrimp on romaine wrap\"" that was actually a frozen dinner style chopped chicken and salad shrimp stir-fry with too much sauce on BIBB LETTUCE not romaine.  It was AWFUL.  Please do not eat here, go to PF Changs and order the delicious Coconut Vegetable Curry.  Delicious.  Kona Grill = Applebee's. I can't believe this last of quality was delivered at Fashion Square.  Happy eating elsewhere!",0
Just OK - The food is pretty good but it is somewhat over priced in my opinion.,2
"Our first time here. As a party of six, we tried the taco flight, comprised of 15 tacos - 3 each of chicken, pork, fish, veggie, and carne asada. Service was slow and inconsistent for both drinks and food. The worst part - they don't give you plates with the flight! Only 15 tacos on a long serving platter. We begged for plates and ended up getting two tiny plates and three coffee cup saucers. The pork and chicken tacos were tasteless. The veggie tacos were shredded lettuce and limp mushrooms. The carne asada was good, and the fish was pretty good except the fish pieces were deep fried in a heavy batter. As for atmosphere, it was typical loud bar noise. Much less than I expected.",1
"I've gotten take out here a few times (it's not really a sit down place). I have really enjoyed the boneless wings and was impressed they were still crispy when I got home. They have a good breading-to-chicken ratio and I really liked the sauces - hot garlic and chipotle BBQ were great.The waffle fries flavored with their various dry rubs are a nice compliment to the wings. \n\nComparisons to BWW are inevitable, so I would say I liked the chicken/breading better at Wings - larger pieces, not overcooked and dry like they can get at BWWs (only had boneless at Wings), and the sauces are good but not as good. \n\nAlso, I wish they did a better job segmenting the wings with different sauces. They use parchment paper but they can still get through when they are in the same box.",3
Line to order lunch at 1:30pm was 10:00 minutes. Service was working hard just that a lot of orders and take out.    Once order it was ready quickly. We had the double gyro plate which was a large lunch. No shortage of meat. I found it to be very tasty.,3
"The prices for juice are hard to beat... but the juices could be better. Some of the flavors are a little off, at least for the testers. They could be improved, and the testers could be cleaned up a little. A lot of them were leaking last time I was in, probably because the tanks are a tight fit where the are placed. I know that they are going through some ownership changes currently... So there's room to improve and clean up. \n\nHope to see more inventory and stock soon. It seems a little empty, still. :)",3
"The Friday Night Fish Fry is pretty gross, actually. There are much better places to go for that. I'm not a fan of their beers, either. It's probably a fine spot for an end of night drink and something to soak up the beer in your belly before you make your way home.",1
"Whoa, nelly, what a breakfast!!!  My friend and I were hungry for a starchy, gut-busting brunch on Sunday and the line to the International House of Pranksters was out the door, so we opted for a lesser-known breakfast joint in the University area.\n\nBigger Bite is located in a restaurant with several re-incarnations, all of which have left traces of their pasts.  In the latest re-incarnation, Bigger Bite is a soul food/Egyptian restaurant with cool murals of pyramids.  We were greeted and seated by the gracious owner, whose name I found out was Eva.  We began our breakfast with excellent coffee (unlike so many soul food restaurants) and I order the lumber jack breakfast platter.  For $7, it include 2 eggs, bacon, sausage, pancakes, and hashbrowns.  The plate skimped on the meat and over-compensated with starches, in my opinion, but was quite tasty.  Of course, I ordered the large orange juice, 20 oz. to be exact.  I think the owner was the lone server that morning and the wait was longer than I expected, but she did a fantastic job of re-filling our coffee and making sure that we had everything we needed.  \n\nI haven't tried the lunch menu, which by the looks was thoroughly Egyptian. But I can safely vouch for the thoroughly American breakfast-this place puts IHOP to shame!",3
"I've bought 2 sets of clubs from James at Custom Golf Center in Tempe, AZ  and one for my wife.   With the second purchase we had several issues with customer service (James didn't return calls or emails) but after a long ordeal we loved the clubs.   These clubs were stolen out of the trunk of our car  and have tried to reorder the same clubs from Custom Golf Center but after over 3 weeks of calls and emails...... NOTHING.\n\nSo James and Custom Golf Center is either out of business, dead, hiding, in jail...... who knows but certainly avoids someone wanting to spend money.   Avoid this company.\n\nJim N \nheyyobuddy@cox.net \nScottsdale, AZ",0
"I use to stay at this hotel a lot, but unfortunately it has gone way down hill. Really run down down hotel.  The only reason I gave it two stars is for the staff-They're really helpful.",1
"My husband and I picked-up take-out from here last night for ourselves and my in-laws. We had the Cashew Chicken, Mongolian Beef (one plain order/one spicy) and Lite Chicken. We served it family style and everyone was delighted. It was all delicious!!! Great flavor, pricing and portion size. A healthier take on the traditional; we will absolutely be going back!",4
"I know most of you read my reviews because I slaughter restaurants on this fine website. Well prepare to be DISAPPOINTED!. This place is AWESOME\n\nTonight was the first time I had ever been to an Uncle Bears, and I was prepared for another mediocre experience. The parking lot was crowded, however the restaurant shares its parking lot with a movie theater, and two trendy restaurants; Pita Jungle and Ra (sushi). It was Friday night around 5:30 pm, and the place looked very crowded, however we did not have to wait more than 10 minutes for a table. This was very rare considering some of the restaurants in the area have 20-30 minute waits. \n\nThe inside is large, however they have it sectioned off so it still feels cozy. I think they are trying to attract an older crowd based on the 70s and 80s music that was playing, but they had no less than 19 flat screens with UFC, MLB playoffs, and college football for the younger crowd. Fun for all. \n\nOur waiter was well dressed & professional and our drinks came out quickly and accurately. Best of all their micro brew was only $4.75 per pint!!!! For our meal my wife and I ordered a bunch of little stuff... Sausage platter, hot wings, pretzel with cheese, and prime rib sliders. \nEVERYTHING was good and with large portions for the money. I have had sausage platters at other micro brews and this was the best one I have had in a long time. It comes with a generous helping of a semi-spicy sausage with iceberg lettuce and bread to put the sausage on. The wings were fried to perfection and were large. The pretzel again was large and had a delicious melted cheese. The prime rib sliders were awesome however I think they would be better served with a horseradish mayonnaise. I asked for some horseradish and it came out in record time considering the place was packed. \n\nAt the end of our meal one of the owners came over to ask us about our experience. The staff was great, food was great, and it felt like the type of establishment that the owners really put their heart into. My wife and I will definitely be back.",4
"I was in the area and wanted to have Sushi for dinner, I normally go to Hockey Sushi in Guelph for sushi, but figured I'd try a new place with my friends this time.\n\nCame here and I was definately impressed with the place itself, well appearance and comfortable seating here.\n\nI've always been fascinated with ipad Ordering system, makes it much more convenient and I don't have to feel rushed while ordering my food with a server.\n\nI live in Markham, so I've definately had much better sushi on a regular basis.  The sashimi here was regular, not super fresh, in fact their salmon tataki still had ice in it as if it was still defrosting, kind of gross.\n\nThey didn't even offer regular salmon hand roll that majority of Japanese places would. Odd, as they only offered spicy salmon hand roll. \n\nThe rolls were filled with too much rice, and too much sauce were placed over them.\n\nThe chicken udon in soup had 2 mini pieces of chicken in there, wasn't impressed. \nI get they're trying to be creative with the dishes.. but diced salmon sashimi on a Pringle? That's just.. not what I expected. \n\nService from the servers were fair, food came at a fast time, however the quality and authenticity of the Japanese food I would rate 2/10.  Definately not coming back.",0
"****restaurant review only****\n\ni used to love la sala rossa. just went this week end with 2 other friends and service was awful. none of us got our food together, the waitress forgot to order some of our appetizer and potatoes, then blamed it on the kitchen (NO-NO!!!) waited for the end of the meal to ask us if we wanted anything else to drink, and a couple of days later, 2 of us realized they completely overcharged our cards! this is a definite \""never-ever\"" no matter how cool the place used to be. a disaster of a dinner.",0
"Consistently great Thai food! Order your food's spiciness on a scale of one to ten, and they always know to put just the right amount. I don't really have one specific favorite dish bc I love them all. However, you must try the pin kapow (chicken), red curry, pad Thai with shrimp and their Tom yum soup. For the red curry, I usually skip the meat and ask for extra zucchini. A bowl of steamy hot rice complements this red curry like no other. Excellent service whether you're dining in, picking up or drive thru!",4
"I think we ate here 3 times while staying at the Palazzo!.  It was good and the portions were big. So worht the money.  I've been to other more \""big name\"" resturants and the food and service didnt come close to this place.  \nI do Agree with the other osters, The mashed potatoes spring rolls are AWESOME!! we had them the first night there after a long flight and painful shuttle ride.  The and teh calamari/vegtables.  It was all soo good and enought to share.\n\nBreakfast was also great. 2Eggs, bacon, toast and hasbrowns for 9.99! very good and too much to finish.\nI aslo went there for my bday dinner with my 8 friends and had a great time, our waiter(tim) was so sweet and funny.  the birthday decorations they did on my dessert was really nice and the recommendations he gave were right on. LOVED the Snitzel!  \nAnd its a plust that they are open late, or 24 hours right next door.",3
"The main thing going for this place Is the cool decor, live entertainment, and great drinks. This is a good place to go with a group so you can try all the different small plates style menu items. The best thing we tasted was the tartare. The least tasty item was the duck confit pasta - it wasn't bad but you get very little duck and the noodles were bland. We tried two desserts - the drumstick (Jameson gelato, salted caramel, and peanut butter ice cream) which was bomb and we also tried the butterscotch pudding which was OK but lacked any real pop. Presentation of all the items were beautiful. The server was quick and friendly. \n\nOh, and make sure to try the drinks. The Mark Twain was fantastic and comes with  spinning glass!",3
"Update:  Unfortunately... the last two times we've come back, the food was just ok.  Definitely not $140.00 great.   We even went for their three plate combo for $40.00 / person, and the cupcake it came with, I only took 1 bite.  I didn't even see the chocolate explosion on the menu... very disappointing.  It would be good, if it was cheaper - but at $140.00, you really want to be wowed...  and that hasn't happened.",2
"Awesome sushi, so so service. Some nights they can be great and some nights they can be incredibly slow with their service.",3
"Fresh tortillas, cheap prices, awesome food at the food bars! I will be back!",3
"The best dry cleaners I have ever used!  I was on the lookout for a new dry cleaners because I was so unhappy with the one I was using. The owners, Curtis and Ha are extemely pleasant and helpful.   My clothes look better than new!  Pricing is reasonable and alterations available.\nAnd they always have bottled water, coffee and treats for the clientele.  They go the extra mile and your clothes show it!!!",4
"Tonight, I tried the Chic-A-Que, a fried chicken breast sandwich with pork barbeque with barbeque sauce. I'm a fan and I'll be back.",3
Ordered the Fish & Chips...HORRIBLE!!! They changed the Cod Fish to Pollack. Menu still says fluffy white fish. Since when is Pollack considered a White Fish?!?,2
"The service here is impeccable, the food is cooked with precision, the plating is beautiful, sadly the taste is sorely lacking and it is unimaginative.\n\nIf we factor in service and everything I would still only give it 3 stars, but 2 stars it is. The service by itself it 5 stars!!!\n\nWe went for the MTL a table special and it was 69$ for 3 service menu.\n\nI had the striped bass sashimi, the duck breast with confit on the side and the apple clafoutis.\n\nThe sashimi was ok, it did have some sorbet on it and pieces of kumkquat which added some nice contrast, but it wasn't anything amazing.\n\nThe duck breast was a disaster in my opinion, the breast was well cooked and placed on a bourguignon sauce. The confit was tucked under a whole lump of cheese infused mashed potato along with some mushrooms. The duck confit was salty but underneath the mashed potatoes which were also salty made it too salty, on top of that the bourguignon sauce was super salty, I mean it was way way oversalted to the point that I didn't even want to touch it. It was a combination of salty on top of super salty, it was not a good dish to eat. Is this really Toqu\u00e9? \n\nI drank so much water, the waiter kept coming back to refill me, I very much appreciated that actually, it's rare to go to a place where your water is always filled no matter how much you drink, I know I don't have to hold back on drinking water here, how sad is it that this is the high point at your restaurant?\n\nThe dessert was in the same vein, sour upon sour, with a spoon of ice cream on the side but that wasn't enough to balance. The clafoutis was sour, paired with plum mousse which was sour and topped with a cranberry which was sour...\n\nThis was the worse meal I've had this year. \n\nI'm not fuming, just very disappointed. The staff is amazing, they are ghosts who appear when you need them, and the service is polite but warm and cozy if you instigate conversation, and they politely disappear when it's over they really don't overstay their welcome...we had a great time nonetheless no thanks to  the food.\n\nWhen the amuse-bouche and the mignardise are better than the regular courses it doesn't say much about the restaurant. I came here 9 years ago, and it was just ok back then so I didn't bother to write a review. but now it's just unforgivable for a place of this stature to be so lame food wise.",1
"Beautiful decor, great looking patio, and comfortable chairs. The overall appearance was appealing.\n But considering the fact that I went there for food it was a disappointment. The mushy, oily crab cakes that had more filling than crab meat that came with a side salad overpowered with cyan paper. The bison steak needed more salt, it was definitely  not a $38 steak. The side order of wild rice was simply not edible.  THe saut\u00e9ed liver that was said to be medium-rare was overcooked the first time and ridiculously raw the second. The food in this restaurant left me disappointed and hungry. I will certainly never be coming back.",0
We've eaten there a couple of times.  The drinks are over-priced and very weak.  Don't think there was any alcohol in there.  The wings were not good.  The fish fry was ok.,1
"This place was horrible! When we first got there the wait staff was a bit rude (not usual for vegas). There was plenty of seating but we were sat with a view of the mall, when asked to move they said the other part of the restaurant was closed but after we got our food they sat people by the windows?!?!? Didn't make any sense! This place was very over priced for such crappy food and service. I will never go back.",0
"Went there for dinner with some friends. Was quite an underwhelming experience. Don't order the Thai Steak Salad, although my friend said the steak part was fine, the salad part was to us the strangest most un-Thai and unpleasant salad experience we've ever had. Perhaps the desserts are good. You can't really screw up ice cream and bananas.\n\nThe patio is a nice place to sit and view the Strip from, but be prepared to catch whiffs of some unusual odors.\n\nAnd the service is extremely slow. Go only if you have a couple of hours to spare.",0
BEST PLACE EVER! Want to purchase all of my cakes from here.,4
"We were a party of 10 that went on Cristmas day, although the food was very good...the service, for the second year in a row, was the worst I have ever experienced! There were only 2 parties seated in our section so it didnt appear that it was because they were overwhelmed with customers, but nonetheless we were at least a half an hour between asking for wine refills and actually getting them, not to mention the wait time between courses was ridiculous...so a leisurely 1 pm lunch turned into a four hour wait for dinner to be served...I would never choose to go there because I despise poor service, especially since the tip was included automatically, but because we go there with family, this is their chosen christmas dining spot...if they stepped up their service, this would be a five star for me!",1
"Wanted to get a quick bite and stopped by this place. I was not too happy- I paid $8 for a slice of pizza and a drink and the pizza was not very good. It seemed to lack good tomato sauce and I think that's what made it so bland. It is located right on the strip, so I'm sure thats why it was more pricey.",1
"I just got this app on my Droid so decided to give this place a try in my new yelp eating adventure since I'm getting bored with all the regular places I eat at. I have to say, so far so good, kind of a shady location but excellent food and nice people working there. \n\nJust stopped in for a quick lunch, just a slice and some wings, tried the Arizona gold wings, FANTASTIC, a sweet onion spicy wing sauce and probably one of the best original wing sauces I've ever had, even though I hate onion, and for the pizza, delicious, nice thin crust and lots of toppings. I'll definitely be back for more. Only thing that would make this place better is if they had a bigger dining room, but still well worth the 5 stars.",4
"Great place, sometimes think they need more seating and some healthier options, hence the missing star. \nThey are the only ones with spinach knish, not just potato. The matzah ball soup is great! And fresh bagels are great. Best place for brunch meals to go.  too bad it isn't more convenient for me!",3
We went here for lunch.  Other than the flan (which why I didn't give it one star) everything else was just bland.  Not worth the money.,2
Big clean well groomed park.  Some rude dog owners don't pick up after their animals but otherwise a great addition to the feel and ever-growing charm of downtown.,4
"This place sucks. Terrible service and I can usually tell how my food is going to be by the chips and salsa. Chips were stale, salsa below average and we had to ask for them. Waitress was more in the mood to socialize with drunkies in the bar instead of taking care of her customers who were there to eat. Food was bland and tasteless. They should change their name to \""Clearance Shelf.\""",0
F--- this place. I would give them NO stars if possible. Should have some sort of disclaimer stating that paid admission does not guarantee entrance into the club. Stood in line for 2+ hours before finally deciding to cut my losses and bounce.,0
Great Happy Hour!  3 bars with excellent drink and food specials.  Staff is very friendly.,4
"Another Chinese place that tries to do everything. I agree that there is a wide variety of food here, but you have to be selective on what you pick. The quality of the ingredients are marginal to say the least. If you are not extra picky and your stomach is strong, then feel free. Hmmmm? how fresh are those frog legs?! \nThe service is decent and the wait staff refills drinks and picks up used plates regularly. Also you have to pay first, but I figure people have been eating and running on them.\nI like sushi, but theirs is probably on the lower end of the gourmet scale. Once at dinner time they had what they consider sashimi (raw fish). Well, it was a pile of thawed salmon in a heaping mound! Eeegads! \nIf you don't want to feel bad after dining here, just pick out some simple items and try not to go for seconds. You'll feel as though you had your meal and your stomach will not complain as much.",1
"Nurses at the front counter are a little spacey and slow but otherwise this urgent care is just wonderful. I asked the front nurse for some tips on preventing an infection I keep dealing with and she just looked at me blank and said she didn't know. I'm sorry but you're a nurse, how the hell do you work here and not have ANY advice to give me? Thank goodness the doctors and nurses in the back know what's going on. In fact they're some of the nicest I've worked with. Definitely go here if you need to, they're some of the most hospitable and friendly doctors who go above and beyond the call of duty to help.",4
"Nice cheap rooms. My room wasn't that bad actually. It was clean and had two beds which I didn't ask for, but hey I can switch beds if I want to. TV was crap though, unclear and the only button that worked on the remote was volume. Clock didn't work which was fine by me since I wasn't there half of the time. Good place to sleep and shower, although the shower was spraying way too hard for me. So it ended up kind of hurting my skin. The creaky parking lot elevator took forever and the sounds that thing made were kind of scary... \nThe betting area is right next to the South Tower elevators which is convenient if you're into horse racing, basketball, etc. Good amount of machines and tables along with the 2nd hand smoke exposure, which is pretty common in all casinos. This is the place to stay if you just want a place to sleep and shower and don't want to pay a lot unless you find a better deal at a better place.",2
Dr.Miller and his staff is the best.,2
"Didn't try the the hot dog cuz there was a \""Willy Wueben\"" on the menu. It was darn good! Had a unique, homemade thousand island dressing and Dublin cheese--yu-um!\nSo nice to have a cold Dad's Cream Soda out of the fridge with it!\nThe place has a warm, kitschy feel with all the Steelers paraphernalia but don't let that scare you! ;)\nVery friendly staff. Attentive service. I'll definitely be back. Cooler weather makes me ache for home-cooked Pennsylvania grub...",4
"Caught them before closing time, being generous with 2 stars regardless the tacos were mediocre at best.",1
"We had 8 girls for a bachelorette party and so I was able to try at least 3-4 plates. \n\nOne of the best plates here is the Chile Relleno. I've had it many times before from Salvadorans that made it from scratch at home so I get pretty picky. Here, the sauce is amazing and so is the stuffing. I didn't pick this dish but I think it was the best one in the group. If I come back here, this is what I'd get, hands down.\n\nI got the Seared Ahi dish but it was not that great. It was ok, but the sauce was more thick and curry like rather than light and delicate. \n\nThe chips and salsa were amazing. Fresh hot chips and the salsa was just spicy enough. \n\nThe margaritas are ok, nothing great, but it wasn't bad. We got the pitcher, which is cheaper than buying individual drinks. We got the strawberry blended margarita and the pineapple margarita on the rocks. The strawberry is better. \n\nThe dishes are quite pricey but the appetizers and tacos were decently priced.",2
"Every single time I come to this airport, I swear, that it has gotten bigger and expanded. I understand they want to be THE airport to be, but seriously, it's just so crazy big! Right now they are still constructing their new tower which would help operationally. But for the average traveller, you are walking all over the place taking a tram to and from the gates to the ticketing or baggage claim. And don't even get me started on the rental car place. Which will get a review from me soon. It's just ridiculously huge! And yet they can't even get it so that pedestrians don't have to cross traffic! I mean, Hello! The pick up drop off area is crazy for both cars and pedestrians! Things I love: ample space to hang before you go thru security, shopping areas if you forgot to get souvenirs, eating places, kiosks to check in at, slot machines for one more chance to win, cool art work. Things I hate: walking forever to anything, no one cleans the tables quickly, walking forever to anything....\nIt's a huge airport. Hopefully this will help them bring more flights like they want.",2
"I am so impressed with Dr. Nett and the staff at Happy Valley Pediatric Dentistry.  They are very professional, yet have such a good manner with kids.  Her staff is upbeat and friendly.  Dr. Nett walked through my children's treatment plan with me, explaining everything very clearly.  I would highly recommend this practice!",4
"Hugo's is an exceptional place to go & eat, & relax. It is old Las Vegas. A place where adults can get away. The food is great, as is the service. Everything about Hugo's is wonderful.",4

"I've been to a few Thai restaurants in Charlotte looking for that amazing Thai flavor I got at the Thai joints back home (Miami) and sadly I am still looking.  However, for the time being this one is close.  I have not been here enough times to be able to rate consistency but on my last visit I was pleased.  I ordered their cashew and vegetable dish and it was so good I almost licked the remaining sauce off the plate.   Im still dreaming about that wonderful basil infused spicy, salty, brothy, tasty sauce.  \nThe vegetarian spring rolls were also delish and they include 4.\nI almost  jumped out of my chair when they asked if I wanted dessert and then mentioned 3 on the menu.  What!?!?!  Dessert?  No Thai place I've been to here has dessert other than sticky rice with mango, if any at all.  YAY!!!!  I ordered the fried ice cream and it was a nice ending to a great meal.  No, it still doesn't compare to the lucious fried ice cream they serve in Miami floating on top of a sweetened condensed coconut milk and drizzled with chocolate sauce..... **drool**  but it will do.  \nIf they add fried Thai donuts to the menu they will have a loyal Fan.  :)",2
"I ordered acorn-sized gravel and they Quick to deliver rock to my house. Once they got me to sign, the dumped a covered load of the WRONG sized rock onto my driveway and drove off leaving watermelon-sized boulders on my driveway. Have called at least 6 times, spoke to one of the managers (anthony) and still have not recieved a call back or any solutions. Great company if you get what you ordered, but if they make a mistake don't expect them to fix it. I still have a pile of the oversized boulders in my driveway. avoid this company!",0
"My very jaded parents were in town and honestly they've seen nearly every major show on the Vegas strip (Love, Jersey Boys, Mystere, O, Phantom, etc, etc) and were looking for a \""unique\"" show. I nervously booked this puppet show based purely on yelp reviews!\n\nNone of us had ever seen America's got Talent or really heard much about this guy. The whole puppet thing looked pretty hokey to me, and I was pretty nervous about convincing my parents to drop $80/ticket on this guy! We were absolutely blown away. He's one of the most talented performers I've ever seen. He has a great voice with or without his mouth closed. It was funny and moved very quickly. It has great \""mass appeal\"" if you will. I'd recommend it to nearly anyone.. it's such a great show. \n\nThanks yelp!",4
"Food was decent but not worth the price. Had lobster tacos which were good, but only four bites. Also had the x roll which was awful from conception to execution and it was $16. I spent 40+ tip but will head to pinks because I am still hungry.",1
"Friendly, clean, comfortable room, good coffee at breakfast.  Very convenient to Town Square and Outlet Mall shopping if you've got a rental car.",2
"La Perla is definitely a safe bet when your in that area. Great salsa and consistent entrees. Oddly I have never tried a margarita there so I can't advise on that. It's a little shabby on the inside but so what, who cares? That's what I expect from a great mexican restaurant.",3
"This review is for the baked goods. I had the pleasure of buying a pack of 4 cupcakes and boy were they delicious! The cake was moist and the frosting was just the right amount of sweet. Each flavor was unique and scrumptious on its own. If your looking for good quality baked goods, look no further! I can't wait to come here for a sit down meal! \nI hope this place stays in business forever!",4
"Exactly what you expect from Chick Fil A.  Consistent food, and great service and a clean restaurant.  Definitely the best of the fast food chains and this one is definitely good.  Only drawback is that is usually very busy, but that is a testament to the food and the experience.",4
Dined here twice....or tried.\n\nOnce for lunch.  Which was delicious and a wonderful experience.  Great lunch menu and the waiter was super.\n\nWent back for dinner this evening....and the waitress was so pretentious and unhelpful and downright rude that our party of five left before we ordered.\nWill not be returning.,1
I absolutely love this outlet mall. It is located just North of the Las Vegas Strip. Great parking and a huge area where taxis can drop you off and pick you up at. Some of my favorite stores are coach.. juicy.. Tommy hill... MK of course :) among many others! One summer I got 6 designer purses for under 500.00. Amazing!!,4
"Horrible service, never once did the waitress came to the table. I almost walked out. Kept on calling for a waiter/waitress and most of the were talking in the kitchen and not attending customers. I will not return to this Dennys.",0
I heart Target!!!  They remodeled and move things around.  Looking good!,3
"It's been a long time since we were here.  I remember this being at least a 4-star place.  But based on this visit, I can't really go over 3-star.\n\nBy looks, the ambiance is fine.  \""Looks Japanese\"".  But they play contemporary rock.  Doesn't fit.  It was enough that I noticed it, which isn't great.\n\nWe couldn't do tepanyaki (my first choice) because they had a \""large party coming\"".  Several people showed-up, but there were still several griddle/tables available.  I assume they didn't have enough chefs to staff them, but don't really know.  If the room had been filled it would have been easier to shrug my shoulders and accept they had reserved the space.  But it wasn't, so it was a bit annoying.\n\nSo we grabbed a table.  We could have grabbed seats at the sushi bar, but we wanted some hot food too.  We ordered a few sushi rolls, and one stir-fried (I assume) beef and vegetable dish (I think it was called Yakiniki).\n\nThe rolls were fine.  Nothing really special.  Better than you get pre-packaged in a grocery, certainly.  But I've had better in other restaurants.  Not as good as I remember last time I was here, but maybe my memory is fooling me.  Given the pricing, it should be better.  Again, they were fine.  But not \""wonderful\"".\n\nThe beef dish was disappointing.  Not much beef.  LOTS of mushrooms, plus some other veggies.  Sauce was nothing special.  Not bad, but I wouldn't order it again.\n\nAll in all, an unextraordinary meal.  It was fine.  But not as good as I remember, nor as good as I would expect for a place that charges what Ninja charges.\n\nGlad I had a Groupon.  Helped defray my actual out-of-pocket, so that was nice.\n\nIf the service had been better I might be able to give 3.5 stars.  But service was inattentive, and inconsistent.  Sometimes it was cheerful, and other times it was impatient.  From the same server over a matter of 10 minutes.  Very strange.  So three stars it is.  I would not avoid this place, but I won't make a point of eating here again either.",2
"I and my daughter were in Scottsdale for spring training, so it was seriously crowded on the Saturday night we went. The noise level was beyond anything I've experienced!  Loud doesn't describe it. The food was great. I had the Chicago style Skirt Steak with burnt onions. Truly great!  The lobster my daughter had she enjoyed very much. The Caesar salad we had was below average. No anchovies and packaged croutons. I can't understand that in a good restaurant. Our waiter was bad - patronizing and insincere beyond what I find acceptable in a waitron - and he forgot our appetizer. I will go back if we come down to Scottsdale again. The food was good enough to warrant a return. I'll skip the Caesar Salad and hope for a better waiter. A reservation is a MUST!  What a crowd this place draws!",2
"Amazing Veggie Burger and Apricot Salmon dish.  Fairly reasonable price, great service, good atmosphere and amazing food...  A hidden gem for certain.",3
"Just dropped off a pre-paid label package.  A young lady was on duty.  Very cheerful.  This was a dead-easy transaction.  Drop off package, get receipt.  Other than having to wait in line (there was one person ahead of me), it was quick and easy.",3
I think the store is okay. It is my last resort when it comes to my go to store. If i need something on my way home ill stop therd\nbut i really am giving 5 stars to the pharmacy for thier work they do. I love the pharm tech kevin and also the two pharmacists that work there!,2
"One 4-lettered \""F\"" word sums up this place: FAIL\n\nThe only thing even remotely Hawaiian about this place is the Polynesian dancing, but even then, they do Tahitian, not hula. Weak.",0
"I wanted to find a place closer to my home in Henderson instead of driving all the way to Chinatown for a foot rub!!\n\nLOVE THIS PLACE.  My boyfriend and I came and got an hour+ massage.  I had ANDY and he had MIA and I would highly recommend both of them!!!! Very strong, efficient and friendly.  \n\nThe store is small and they care.  They also give you a punch card.  10th massage is free.  \n\nI look forward to returning!!!",4
"Well i wish i didn't sit next to the guy who worked here during the world Cup soccer game. He might have spilled too much information, but it was enough to lower the ratings. Even though the sides are all looking good, they are all frozen, including those well built onion rings. The burgers may be fresh as he said they get them daily from \""a place down the street\"", but they don't grind the meat daily or in-house. Not sure what goes on down the street. The sauces are still good, but now I'm not sure if they are made in-house either. Most people won't care about all these details, but if your looking for a top of line burger and fries experience, this situation will not be the answer. The happy hour does run from 11am to 6pm and the drink specials for domestics are good at $2.50, but maybe some of that frozen food needs some rehabbing or they need bigger digs to churn out a top notch experience. Also, please invest in some real lettuce - the stuff that came out on top of the burger looked like green confetti.",2
"1 of 5 and 1 of 1. .....Part 1 of 2\n\nWelcome my 'Duo' review. Two bars, one of the best and one of the worst in the valley. A great example of opposites.  I hope you enjoy reading both!\n\nWelcome to AZ 88. This is the perfect example of a successful bar. The name is simple, it was opened in 1988 by Kopp; a name synonymous with frozen custard, ask anyone in Wisconsin! The owners also own a bar in New York, Bar 89, and Elsa's in Milwaukee.  I have been to Bar 89 in New York when I lived there, and I've gotta say, very much like AZ 88. \n\nNow some of you out there are a bit skeptical because of AZ 88 rep. Let me put you at ease, AZ 88 is not a gay bar, well not entirely. Yeah there are a few from the gay community but at the same time there are performing art fans on nights when there's an event. So it's as much as a performing arts bar, straight bar as it is a gay bar. Think of it this way, I find it a great place to bring a date (especially a first date) for a late dinner and drinks. Hey guys think of it this way, your date may not get hit on as much here as most bars and your date will rave about her Cosmo! \n\nThe eats here are some of the best you'll find in a bar. The Hell's Fire chips are house made potato chips, fried to order and basted with hot sauce and blue cheese. Too good not to order, a must, just don't order with a martini, it won't work with a heavy gin or vodka drink. If you must drink hard, have a Cosmo with the Hell's. The Alfredo burger is a winner too, a burger basted with creamy Alfredo sauce. Also, try the spicy, grilled chicken sandwich with jalapenos and honey. This may seem bizarre to you but it works, when you bite into the sandwich its sweet at first then finishes spicy, great flavor. Everything I've tried here is a home run. From apps to sandwiches, fruit plate to burgers, I've never been let down, kudos to the kitchen staff.\n\nAs for the drinks, you may not find any better in town. Order a Jack and Coke and you'll get a rock glass with Jack served with a small, retro, glass bottle of Coke. Sit at the bar and order a martini and watch as the bartender shakes ever drop out into your glass as the martini itself convexes over the top of your glass making you first sip a 'lean over'.  The bar is well stocked, with just about every liquor you'd expect. I judge the best bars by 1st the vodka selection, then bourbon, tequila and lastly rum. It's unfortunate people don't order more rum, especially here, they have Appleton Estate Black Label, a scotch drinkers rum, try it on the rocks; it'll change your life. The beer selection is great too, as with wine by the glass. No matter who you're with, the size of your party, everyone is sure to find a drink to their liking. \n\nThe places design and d\u00e9cor is unrivaled in the valley because of one simple truth, its ever changing. The artwork changes constantly. Go around Christmas and see the most radical Christmas tree ever. Hey, I'm Jewish and I go every year to see their tree! One year it was hundreds of silver painted mannequin head circulating. Another year the tree was upside down, hung from the ceiling. Another it was Barbie dolls in different color liquids in bottles in the shape of a tree, too many to count, just extraordinary. The art behind the bar changes too, from unique artwork to unique mirrors and shapes. Every time I go the place has changed, I look forward to going sometimes just to see what has changed.\n\nAs with every review I always take the restrooms into account, think of it this way, if the public areas are unclean or not kept in a acceptable physical condition it begs the question, what do the areas the guest can't see look like, say the back of the house, specifically the kitchen. AZ 88's restrooms are always clean as a whistle. They are also some of the most unique I've seen. When going to restroom the wall is the door and only marked at the bottom of the door. The hand washing sinks have a window below, seeing through into the dining room. When you go, check them out, super cool.\n\n Seating is comfortable. The tables are just the right distance not to intrude upon each other. The long black couches recline, so if they are available, request them, after a few drinks you'll be thanking me. There is outdoor seating as well, though the tables do seem a bit closer together.\n\nAZ 88 takes music seriously here, or rather the 'audio architecture' as I like to call it. There is a DJ booth above with an experienced DJ spinning everything from acid jazz to 80s, rock to blues, and it all works. Its nice to see (or rather hear) that the owners understand that good background music stimulates conversation and adds to the experience. The volume is always at the perfect level, to listen or have a conversation without screaming. \n\nSince AZ 88 opened many other bars have opened in Scottsdale, no matter how many bars open around it, AZ 88 will always be a prime place for a late night bite, a drink or just a night out people watchin",4
"Come for the beer, leave before the food comes.\n\nI had a hankering for tarte flamb\u00e9, the Alsatian relative of pizza. I was willing to put my high expectations formed from multiple visits to Strasbourg in check. (You would assume that you could get descent Alsatian food in Francophile Qu\u00e9bec...) By any standard, it was awful. Soggy and chewy crust and toppings lost everything in translation.",2
"meh, not bad, but I expected better. Bellagio is much better in my opinion.",2
"We went to the Bellagio for brunch at around 10:30am and were really surprised that there wasn't much of a line. We got through it quickly and were seated right away. The highlights of the buffet were definitely the breakfast items. The eggs, bacon, and potatoes were so good that after trying a few other items, I went back for seconds! The waitress did a good job making sure our drinks were refilled promptly and the ambiance was nice. For the price and the fact that it was brunch, it was a lot of money, but I guess it's expected at the Bellagio.",2
"Stop Two on the LV Cupcake Tour 2008... Mad Hatter Cupcakes!\n\nMad Hatter has a cool idea, and as Phillip T. and Keith A. put it well, it's basically like a Coldstone Creamery for cupcakes. Pick your base, pick your filling, pick your frosting and even a little decoration for the top. Good... IDEA.\n\nFor $3.25/cupcake, these cupcakes are incredibly overpriced. In fact, they were the most expensive and the least impressive cupcakes on our tour. \n\nWe split the following cupcakes: Mad About Strawberry, Mocha Latte and Island Joy. They also had samples of Mad About Chocolate, which we obviously tried!\n\nOne thing we noticed about all these cupcakes is how moist they are. Moist cupcakes=YUM, but the moistness of these cupcakes was very uncommon. I'd like to know how they make the cupcakes so moist... I hope it's a combination of baking technique and natural ingredients, and aren't pumping these babies with chemicals. \n\nMad About Strawberry- Entirely strawberry, with strawberry flavored caupe, filling, and frosting. NOT good, and that takes a lot for me to say about a cupcake! The cake itself was unidentifiable and had no taste of strawberry... or vanilla, or anything for that matter. The frosting was so artificial tasting and sickeningly sweet that it was the only cupcake I didn't finish on the entire tour. I do NOT recommend getting this cupcake. \n\nMad About Mocha- Coffee base with chocolate ganache filling and java bean frosting. This one was better, but still extremely artificial tasting. \n\nIsland Joy- This was my favorite cupcake at Mad Hatter. It tasted just like an Almond Joy candy bar. Coconut base with chocolate ganache filling and coconut frosting. The frosting was great. I'd buy a round of coconut frosting shots for everyone! \n\nAll in all, this place is way overpriced. If the quality of the product was combined with the customization, then MAYBE they'd be able to get away with $3. However, every cupcake on our tour was better than these, and less expensive. If you are in the area and want cupcakes, skip the Mad Hatter and go down the street to Cupcake Lane.",1
"Il Fornaio makes one of the best loaves of bread in the known universe.  Crisp and chewy, it delivers that magical punch that bread should have.\nI long loved the location in Marin County, but the Vegas venue lacks the ambience and open brick fireplace and rusticity.\nWe dined here as part of a before theater package to see Zumanity, and got a great deal, a fifty dollar meal credit.  The waiters were prompt, since we told them we were going to see Cirque.\nThe meal was decent, great Olive oil with the bread, a decent salad, and well cooked linguine with seafood, but the restaurant was a bit noisy, and not as relaxing as a true Italian eating experience should be.\nStill one of my favorite elegant Italians, but not my favorite venue.",2
"It's really not a bad place to watch a game.  Big TVs, decent beer choices, edible fried foods, nice staff.  With a few changes it could be a 4 star joint. \n\nBut here's the deal:  every time some schmo orders their signature two foot long hotdog  platter called the \""Big Unit\"" - a horrifying, shrill, alarm rings off and the staff simultaneously yells the eponymous name.  \n\nWhen I was there, 17 such \""Units\"" were purchased in rapid succession.   I watched the rest of the game in fear of another order.  \n\nThanks for the PTSD Alice Cooper!",1
"Yeah yeah the food is pretty good - just like everywhere else in Vegas. The service was even pretty good. But the seating is uncomfortable and everyone is squeezed into a tight spot. I know they're trying to maximize profit, but they've done so at the expense of the experience.",2
"We stopped at Papa J's last Friday night (8/1) for a round of drinks. There were 7 of us altogether and we had eaten at another restaurant earlier in the evening.  One member of our party walked up to the bar to let them know we were sitting on the couches along the wall, as it was fairly busy that night. In the short time that he was there, a man who was behind the bar looked at him and then turn away without saying a word or notifying anyone else. He then turned to a waitress who had approached the service area of the bar and asked her if  we could have a server take our drink order. She said \""yep\"" and then abruptly turned and walked away. At that point, he asked to see the manager  who came a few minutes later. When my friend told him of what had occurred, the manager said \""What do you want me to do\""?\n\nMy friend said \""An apology would be a good start\"" whereupon the manager looked back at him and said \""Get out and don't come back\"" ???????? Are you kidding????\n\nMy friend is well traveled and frequently stays at higher end hotels and dines at quality restaurants. He was not screaming or belligerent in any way, shape, or form; simply informing the manager of what had occurred. \n\nThat being said, we left and went back to 131 East, where we had previously eaten. The service there was fabulous, as was the meal and the drinks creative and exquisite.\n\nThere are new restaurants that have opened in Carnegie as of late. Papa J's is no longer the only game in town.  Obviously this is the way a simple complaint is handled by management. Appalling!!  Do yourself a favor and frequent any of the other restaurants that are within walking distance of Papa J's. They understand the concept of  customer service.",0
We are from out of town and were getting married in Vegas.  We were able to put our order in online the morning we flew out and it was ready for one of our local friends to pick up by the time we got there.  They made it so easy to get what we wanted in a timely and convenient manner.  They even called to verify the order since all my info was not local.  Very friendly to work with.,3
"I go to their Oktoberfest every year, I would not miss it.  I love the live music, the great food, dancing, and of course the fabulous beer.  But it's nice to go back occasionally when things are less hectic and crowded, and what I get is really good German food and some of the best beers made in Pittsburgh.  There's an Old World taste to the beer made here and it's authentic and satisfying.  The Penn Brewery is a real gem!",3
"Food was okay, but staff is RUDE. Still trying to figure out how I was charged $15 for what should have been $8.95 as lunch special. A bowl of mediocre pasta for $15? Definitely not worth it.",1
"So, my friend and I are waiting in line at the taxi stand at Circus Circus. Guy working at the casino asks if any one wants a car service. We asked how much, and he said 28 dollars. We get in the car, and the driver asks us how much the employee said for the trip. We then said 28, and he agreed. We get to the Hard Rock, and the driver asks for 48 bucks. We are taken aback of course, it has been a long time since someone has scammed me. We said no way, and he said that he could just drive us back to Circus Circus. We said go ahead, Jerk. He then told us on the way back we would have to pay anyway. He had us locked in. My friend had enough and climbed out the window, I took his phone and said let me out, he was kidnapping me. He then chased us down the street, getting out a few times to attack us verbally. He wanted to start a fight with us, and we said go ahead, take a swing. By now, we had made it to another casino. The staff there seperated us, and we dealt with the cops. A half an hour later, we were free to go. Never use this company. I'm sure that jerk driver is trying the same rip-off move on someone as I type.",0
"was on vacation in Montreal and this place came highly recommended.\nif you are in montreal don't miss this cool old prison turned cool italian restaurant.\nauthentic food, great service\ncan't wait to go back\ndef get the porchini pasta and the gorgonzola tortellini",4
"One of the best meals we have had in many years. Complement and counterpoint. Les 400 Coups's average rating should not suffer because two people couldn't get in the door or because the place has a totally reasonable policy against people just drinking at the bar.\n\nAn appetizer of local French beans was fabulous. A terrific flavor combination of smoked bread, extra-vieille Mimolette, and fresh beans.\n\nSweetbreads were nice and light. Very good accompaniment of spelt and miniature radishes. Even with beurre noisette, it was neither rich nor cloying. \n\nPot de cr\u00e8me is often a dessert for small children. This version was, in keeping with the evening's theme, surprisingly light. Rich caramel and salt.\n\nOur server was very nice. He gave a commendable bilingual recitation of the Scotch selection.\n\nWe would love to come again. I would be happy to eat there now, at 9:53 AM. I could eat the same things I had last night.",4
Very expensive and the service was not very good. I won't be back.,1
"I think Yelp should have negative stars, because this company certainly deserves it!  I was flying for the first time by myself on Tuesday Oct, 25th, and I don't fly well to begin with, so I was a nervous wreck.  My cell phone must have fallen out of my back pocket and after the past 2 days of talking with these people it's incredibly apparent they lack customer service skills.  I spoke with lost and found and she stated that Yellow-Checker-Star is actually 3 cab companies and that the cabbies often give their receipts to other cabbies if the cabbie doesn't have enough receipts, but rest assured that the cabbies are very honest and turn in lost items.  Ok, seriously, you said that all in the same sentence and want me to trust a cabbie that is obviously cheating his company, but wouldn't dare think about cheating me?  At this point I couldn't care less about the phone, I just want my chip that had all my pictures on it.  I then talked with Human Resources and was told \""I don't have time to look for that receipt, we have 10,000 receipts come through here a day, and I just don't have the time for that.\""  If I were the damn police I bet your little ass would get a move on it and find it then!  My husband knew within 20 minutes of me losing my phone, thanks to a very nice lady in the airport security who let me use her phone, and called my phone at least a 100 times in a 4 hour period before having my phone canceled, and I find it very hard to believe that the cabbie didn't hear it!",0
"I visited here after a morning of shopping in the nearby shops and mall. I found this restaurant using the \""TV Foodie\"" app as Big Earl's was featured on Man vs. Food.\n\nI love BBQ and the food here did not disappoint. I had a pulled pork sandwich with a side of the seasoned fries. The fries were delicious and the pulled pork was juicy, melt in your mouth, good. I love the tangy BBQ sauce and I wish I was able to bring some home with me.\n\nI also ordered a sangria to accompany my meal. It was an apple sangria, with a hint of cinnamon spice to it. Definitely a different and delicious twist to citrus sangrias.\n\nIn addition to great food the service was great. We had a fabulous waiter who was quick and helpful. The owner even stopped by our table for a visit and a fun photo op! Next time I am shopping in the area I definitely plan to visit again!",3
Had a sandwich from here and honestly I've had better from the grocery store. You know those premade sandwiches that are just wrapped in plastic wrap. \nThe bread is super hard so I just ate the cheese meat and veggies on the inside. This place ain't worth your time.,1
"Placed online order.  My order was $75 qualified for free shipping.  They confirmed the order.  Later, they sent an email saying they did not have one of the five items on my order.  Because the order was no longer over $75, they cancelled the whole order.  They refused to honor the free shipping despite their error on inventory.  The guy had an attitude and was kind of an ass.  Poor customer service.",0
"I really don't know how this place has such great reviews. I walked in on Friday night to order takeout. I waited at the bar/counter area for about 10 minutes with maybe 5 other people all waiting to order take out or pick up. It seemed very chaotic for the one woman behind the counter taking orders, fetching them, and ringing them out. It looked like she was even serving on the floor at times. The food took about 20-25 minutes once my order was placed. Prices were okay, but the food wasn't anything to write home about. I got Hot & Sour Soup (nice and spicy) and Mongolian Beef (a weird light brown color...).\n\nAs for ambiance, it definitely has that feel of chinese restaurants from the 90's.",1
"I forgot to mention about the room on my previous review.\n\n\nThis is my first time stayed at the circus circus and should be the last time.  The hotel room is very old and dirty.  I had been to some other old hotels, but they are CLEAN.  Circus circus's room is very dirty.  I booked this hotel because I wanted to take my 7 years old daughter to enjoy indoor playground.\n\n1. carpet is wet and sticky.\n2. The room has very strong cigar smell, but the room should be smoke free room.  ????\n3. blankets are old and dirty.  My daughter (7 years old) and I was very itchy and hopefully I did not carry any bed bug back home.\n4. restroom floor is sticky/dirty and I can smell the restroom smell.\n5. small restroom and small tub\n6. wall is very thin and I can hear sounds all night long.\n7. we stayed at the manor which means is far away from the main building.  I need to drive to the indoor playground and to the hotel casino.\n\nI been to Las Vegas so many times and this is the worst stay ever.  \n\nGood luck to others like to stay here!\n\nI will have to go see doctor today because my skin is still itchy.",0
"Well money talks so they talked me into giving them another try.  Well, I ended up telling them I never wanted to hear even their name again.  4wks later and I still had nothing hooked up and they cut the main cable line to my condo property and at&t's line when trying to bury some new lines for me.  They have no idea what they are doing and you get a different story each time you call them.  They better never even step foot near my door again.  Horrible !!!!",0
"An honest mechanic!  This place is a full service auto repair shop in addition to an \""Xpress Lube.\""  I have been taking my vehicles here for a while now and am very pleased with the service.  The prices are fair and quality of the work is top notch.  The best part is that these guys are actually honest which unfortunately tends to be a rare quality with mechanics in this town.  I have been to a lot of auto repair shops in town and have not always been treated fairly.  I am happy to give this place five stars.  I will be back.",4
"What could be more fun than shooting zombies? Shooting zombies with a .44 Magnum, of course!\n\nI went in with a group of six. Our rangemaster was helpful, friendly, and had a great sense of humor -- although the ones at neighbouring lanes didn't seem quite so much so. Luck of the draw might therefore impact your overall enjoyment, but if you can get Alan, you're in for a treat.\n\nYes, it does get a little cramped in there, but let's face it: you're not going to work on your qualifying, you're going to shoot big guns with your friends. Sharing a lane and instructor and comparing shots is way better than going in, unloading a few clips, and then going home.",4
"Sodas! Peanut Butter Soda, Butterscotch Soda, Faygo, Jones. You name it they have it.\n Also, Candy Cigs, and all the candy from my childhood. They also have some from other countries, and a wide variety of Salt Water Taffy.\n Signs, and fun stuff, and all next to a theater that doesn't check your back pack. :) Heh.",4
"What a joke. My wife was getting gel nails next door at Pink Nail Salon (awesome place, by the way), and I strolled next door to find out the wait time at SuperCuts. The lady behind the counter said it would be a 45 minute wait, so I put both our names on the list. We returned forty minutes later, checked in, and had a seat. For the next hour, we watched a parade of appointments and walk-ins enter the salon and be taken ahead of us. When a lady (obviously a regular) strolled in and asked one of the stylists \""Do you have time to do a cut?\"" And the stylist replied \""Sure, come on back.\"" My wife and I decided to take our business elsewhere. Permanently. \n\nThis was the second time we had patronized this particular establishment. The first time we had both been given decent haircuts in a reasonable amount of time (ignoring the stylists bad mouthing a customer who had just left. So to summarize: rude stylists, unprofessional behavior, one decent cut out of two attempts.",0
The food here is more than wonderful. The staff treats you like you're at home. It's one of the best little joints I've been too in a long time. The menu changes daily so you can have something different every day. The prices are very reasonable. Highly recommended. Come and enjoy.,4
"Taco was good. I just had the beef with guac. They charged $1 for the guac! Margarita was frozen goodness. Typical chain but good. It is inside an old downtown building and has cool colors.  Very clean as well with attentive staff. They collected my trash!  The atmosphere was all business lunch but I had a relaxing time with my taco and drink.  Go for lunch, you will not be disappointed.",2
"I don't doubt the quality of the food, it was pretty good, especially for the price. The interior was pretty well decorated for a university shop, however the service was terrible.\n\nWent with a couple of friends, waited to be seated by standing near the entrance. They did not see us at all for the longest time and the restaurant wasn't even busy at the moment. So we took the liberty to self-sit oursleves, and then kept waiting for  the servers to see us. They didn't so we had to wave them down before the server even realized they had new customers. We ordered and one of our friend's dish was entirely forgotten. They never came to check on us, or even look at us to see how we were doing. \n\nI've been here more than a couple of times and the service has always let me down, so I'm sure why other people think the service is good. This probably doesn't always happen, but this experience sucked, therefore 2 stars....",1
"My friend is a fan of Brighton so when I saw the store in the Caesars shops I wanted to have a look.  The silver jewelry is ok and looks much better on my friend than I found on the displays.  Prices are more than I think it's worth for the look, as it's more metal looking than shiny.  They have a good selection of earrings, necklaces, and bracelets.  I also saw 2 cute rings holders; one with one prong and the other with 3.  The price of the one prong was $38 and more than I was willing to pay.\n\nThe holiday display had lovely snowflake earrings that I liked with a jewel in the middle.  I couldn't find them by the display so I looked for an associate to ask.  The first one I saw wasn't making eye contact with me and I wasn't 100% certain she worked there so I tried to find someone else.  The one lady was to the side of the cash area and talking to a customer and telling her come back anytime and find me.  Then she left and when I was standing there, she walked right by me.  I had to say excuse me and then she looked at me.  I asked her where the earrings from the display were and she said she would get them for me.  She brought them to me and asked \""So you want them?\"" I looked at them and the price for $38 and she asks again if I wanted them.  I said I'll think about it, and left the store.  The earrings were cute but definitely not worth that price.  The sales staff here don't offer great service and when they do help you, they expect you to buy.\n\nLots of other places to shop that offer jewelry and also better service.",1
"I ordered the spicy pork. The flavor of the sauce was good and the meat was cooked well, but it was also very stringy and fatty. Overall, the food was mediocre. The food prices are too high for the quality offered. However, the portion sizes are quite large, so there should be leftovers for extra meals.\n\nOur service was terrible. The servers would not look in our direction for 20 minutes at a time. They did not once visit during the meal. They brought two dishes out 10 minutes before the others and brought one person's food out 15 minutes after everyone else had their food. We had trouble paying, since they would ignore us and wipe down an adjacent empty table even though we were clearly waving and yelling to them.\n\nThe combination of terrible service, average food, and high prices ensures that I will not return.",1
"Hash House definitely didn't disappoint me with the amount of food they served on each plate. Unfortunately, HH wowed me with quantity and not with quality. Don't get me wrong, everything was edible, but I felt the combination of the Sage Fried Chicken w/ Waffles could have been executed better.\n\nI think the Maple flavored bacon inside the Waffle was a great idea. Trying to achieve that Sweet and Salty flavor some people crave, but this could have been accomplished with smaller bits of bacon within the Waffle. Instead you have large pieces of bacon stuck in between each waffle, I ended up avoiding the bacon all together.\n\nThe caramel for this dish actually ruined my Fried Chicken. I prefer my Fried Chicken, untouched with any condiments, this is just a personal preference, but it may apply to those who are considering this dish.  The Fried Chicken itself was crispy, tender, but lacked some unique flavors. I didn't taste any spice or herbs that may have been used in this dish.\n\nFYI: Because their portions are fairly large, there is ~$2.50 surcharge for splitting a dish. The server recommended I order french fries on the side, instead of paying for the surcharge.",2
"I was really excited to try this place considering I love the name and the fact that it's so burgh.  One of my other friends had been there a few months prior and said it was a really cool place with good food, so I thought I'd try it out.  My friend and I went there the Saturday after Christmas for brunch/lunch.  We were initially impressed with the decor inside and our server was very nice.  We both were in the mood for more of a lunch than brunch.  At this time on Saturday's, they only offer a very limited amount of choices that are not on the brunch menu.  My friend got the egg burrito which she had ordered without onion and I got the Pittsburgh Steak Salad.  When we got our food, her burrito was filled with onions. She ended up picking them out.  My salad was sub par at best.  The only thing that I liked were the french fries and honestly how hard is it to screw that up?  My salad was drenched in this kind of gross ranch and had peppers all throughout it that were tasteless.  My steak was cooked right, but the quality of the meat was not good...very chewy.  The coffee was good but we did have to ask our server a few times to refill our drinks (they had been empty for awhile and the place was dead...we were one of only three tables).  The bathrooms were out of soap and toilet paper.  When we told the staff they didn't seem to care.  I have had better, fresher salads at GetGo.  I won't be back...ever.  For what they charge and the quality of the food...I would choose another place.  There are many other restaurants in town that offer much higher quality food for the price.",0
"I've spent over an hour today trying to track down a copy of our room bill. This is a fitting end to what was an awful experience from booking, to check in, to the actual quality of the amenities, and checking out. Trying to get the staff of the Mandalay Bay to help with anything is a near impossible feat. Take adding a person's name to the room for example. That took three phone calls and nearly an hour of time. I'm sitting on hold (min 26:48) as I type this review, still unable to connect with anyone capable of sending me an invoice.  Go to the cosmopolitan, or literally anywhere else.",0
This place is GOOD! It's out in the middle of no where but well worth the drive. Everthing that we ordered was spot on.  I felt the dinner portions were small for the prices but the taste and quality of the food is well worth it.,3
"It was just by lucky coincidence that i was staying directly opposite Edinburgh Larder during my stay. And what a find! the food was wonderful, delicious and very fresh. I went for the traditional Scottish breakfast with a pot of Scottish breakfast tea and a Delicious chocolate brownie. Next time in Edinburgh, i'll be popping in again.",4
Poutine. Poutine! POUTINE.\nLove their fries and house sauce. Poutine made to measure. Perfect.,4
"First time going and was very excited since I'd heard so many wonderful things about it. Weeeell, apparently Tuesdays are not the day to go.  They were out of a lot of things such as the coconut shrimp and the food was not that tasty. I ended up getting the Chicken Marsala at the suggestion of the waiter and unfortunately, I was not impressed. The sauce was a little too sweet for my taste, not at all like I'm used to with other Marsala sauces. I  only ate about half of it and didn't want to take the rest home altho the garlic potatoes were good. My friends both ordered the Fettuccini Alfredo and we're also underwhelmed. The Alfredo sauce was so thick it looked like mayo and one friend had to actually send hers back. I reluctantly ordered dessert hoping to taste something that lived up to the hype I've heard and read about.  After being told they no longer serve the chocolate lava cake, I decided to get the 5 layer chocolate cake, and it was pretty good...I actually wanted to bring the rest home. Both friends also enjoyed their desserts, tiramisu and key lime pie. We had the fried mozzarella for an appetizer which was nice. I'll give it another try on a day other than Tuesday and see how it goes. Fingers crossed for a better experience.",2
"very good, very refreshing, very fresh with a very creative spin on how to make a good sandwich, all in all my new favorite sandwich spot. fukk subway lol...",4
I had an assortment of sushi for an appetizer.  Fresh and well prepared.  For main course I had the Filet Mignon with grilled zucchini. The steak was cooked perfect.  A nice place to get an assortment of surf meets turf dining options.,2
Turkey burger was very well seasoned. Everything was really fresh & clean. Would definitely go here again!,3
"This place was a bit of a dissapointment with all the raving reviews on Yelp. \nMy first reflection is that the place looks much more cosy on the pictures and that the sound level is very high. Feels more like a bar with food then a restaurant.  \n\nThe food then......\n\nI had the fair trade short ribs with coffee rub , dried cherry bbq sauce, roasted \nparsnip pur\u00e9e and seasonal veggies for 28 $. I love shortribs if they are made right and the coffee rub made me think of the calfs liver in coffee/veal reduction i loved at Ralp Lauren's Bistro in Chicago so i had high hopes for this dish.  \n\nIm sad to say that i didnt feel that Citizen Public House delivered. \nThe short ribs (on the bone) was tender and not bad put i could taste any of the coffee rub. The cherry bbq sauce was so so and the parsnip puree that might have been the best thing on the plate was not veru much of. It was a smaller \""pile\"" hidden under the veggies that also was ok. \n\nMy companys fil\u00e9 of beef was better in my opinion but at 120 $ for two mains and 2 glasses of red i think this place was a little to expensive for the food and the experience. With so much great food in Scottsdale i just dont think this place is worth the hype. \n\nService was ok but nothing special. Location in old town is great though!",2
"Needs to be worked on, thinking about getting another Groupon for this place but i'm going to hold back on that. Would I return back, maybe depending if it's still there in a few months. This location has lots of business come and go because of no traffic. Place is nice and clean. Service is ok. But the food is not bad, but not great to where there is a signature dish. It's like eating at a college cafe or mall food in a food court. It's great if your hungry and even better with a Groupon. Paying regular price, well depends, there prices are reasonable.  They have boba and other drinks. Overall this place needs some improvement.",2
"Finally tried this place in Arizona! It was cute, concepts the same as all the other locations I've been to in california.. With the exception of their soup station being pretty small, no dessert bar just soft serve (which was mm mm mm) and you had to pay for cookies -.- BUT the salad bar is still amazing, the Mac and cheese, the cornbread, the pizza, the baked potato.. All still there and all delicious. Who doesn't love getting stuffed off nothing but leaves and water?:p",3
"Located in the Planet Hollywood miracle mile mall we checked and couldn't find many better options as far as sports bars to watch the ncaa final four games.  The place had all you can drink beer happy hour and with games on that basically everyone in the bar was interested in, it made for a festive atmosphere.\n\nIt seemed hard to flag down a waitress, when i finally did i ordered some nachos that were pretty good.\n\nWould probably go back here if i wanted to watch a sporting event that happened to fall in to their happy hour(s).",2
I went to pita jungle today on shea at lunch and was told that they would not take any more customers because they were too busy.  I was not given a wait time or to go order as an option.  I was just told that no more tables are available today and turned away.  I did not appreciate the customer service I was given.  Should it not be the customers decision to wait if there are long wait times?   I have never had this happen to me before at a restaurant.  I think that pita jungle management should let this GM know that it is never appropriate to turn away customers when the restaurant is busy as it is not good business.,0
"I really don't get what the hype is. My husband went here with his friends on his bachelor party and said it was sooo good so he had to take me. I don't know if when I went, I just got the wrong thing or what, but I got the ribeye steak and it was just average. It was not as good as some of the steak I've had in the past and it was very heavy. I have heard the bone in filet mignon is very good but have not been able to try it yet. The sides are okay as well. It's a very roudy restaurant and the ambience is not that great because it kind of floats atop a shopping area. It was not as good as everyone had been raving about.",2
If you are getting a detail run away! They avoid giving price similar to when you buy a car. You can get a better job done for half the price.,0
"I'm pretty sure I forced my 2 friends to come in here after leaving Tryst because after 2 shots and too many other drinks, I was NOT done for the night.  We walked in and sat down and yeah...not too many people left in there.  I think rather than going after the club, you'd probably want to come before and grab a drink.  It's definitely pretty inside, we walked by on our last day and I got a sober view of it, so you can take my word for it from my second view inside.  :)",2
"What a huge disappointment - from the bland, expensive burger to the un-pickle that accompanied it.\n\nFor $12 (base burger price) plus $1 (cheese) plus $1.50 (bbq onions), I got a $14.50 letdown.  \n\nSave your dollars and go to Margaritaville for a wonderful cheeseburger in paradise (with a delicious pickle to boot) for a much better price.  It's right across the street.  Plus, you don't have to deal with the pretension.  Bonus.",1
Food quality has gone downhill a bit from last few years. \nThe owner  has bad attitude and not customer friendly. \nExpect $7 for 2 year old baby food if you give samplers during the buffet. Apparently it is the kids buffet price. We will stick to other places in the valley.,1
"The place looks great and I love the beer. The food looks great but it doesnt taste great.... it's usually overly salted. like calm down with the salt shaker.\n\nI like that they offer $2 mini beers so that you can try multiple. That's a-okay in my book. \n\none last thing... what's up with the waiters? ALL of them! They've all got the personalities of awkward engineers.  I actually was so certain our waiter was an awkward engineer that I asked him if he was a student at U of I.  Imagine my surprise when he said he studied library sciences. WAAAAH?\n\nAnyways, moderate place for food, good place for beer, awkward but polite service.",2
"It was our first time here and everything was going smooth. We came in about 5:30pm and it was getting busy. We waited to be seated and I thought it was pretty cool they had a couch you can chill on while you wait. \n\nWhen we were seated, our server greeted us in a timely manner. We asked for some help since it was our first time and he did a fine job letting us know what was popular and pointed us to certain things I asked about. I asked him to go ahead and get our drinks while we decide what we wanted to get.\n\nHe came back and asked if we were ready and we said that we were. We placed our order (Number 3, which is 3 pc chicken with two waffles, and a chicken strip basket with fries and a side of corn bread) and then he asked \""So what did you guys want to drink, again?\"" Wait a minute. I thought we had already given him our drink order and instead of coming with them, he came and asked what we wanted. That was a tad annoying. \n\nOur order was brought out by a lady who didn't really acknowledge us. Basically \""who had this or that\"" and placed them in the center of the table anyway. She just left without saying a word or asking if we would like anything else. Right away, we noticed we had gotten everything except for our corn bread. We waited for our waiter to make his rounds but he didn't come back. It took awhile but he came to seat someone else so the couple seated at the table next to us got his attention and said that they were missing a few items from their order. So we weren't the only ones. \n\nAfter a few trips back and forth to them because he kept forgetting things they were asking for, I got his attention and said that we were missing corn bread. He said he would bring them out. I saw him a few times after that helping other customers and that's fine but he came back to our table and asked how we were doing...without our corn bread. I had to remind him again that we needed corn bread. We were almost done with our meal by this time.\n\nAfter he finally brought it to us, he started coming around a little more. At that point, I wasn't sure whether or not if it had slowed down or not. I figured it did since he was coming around some more. It was kind of too late, anyway.\n\nWhen it came time to bring us our bill, he had to ask us what we had ordered today. I was surprised... He said they had misplaced our order. How does that even happen? I've never heard of such a thing...EVER. I should have just told him that service was lousy and since they had lost our order stub, I didn't have to pay for the food. But since I did eat it (cause I was hungry mind you) and possibly a little too understanding, I gave him my entire order again.\n\nSo we paid and started leaving and I saw that it was as packed as ever. Worse than when we had arrived. I didn't understand why he would have time to keep checking on us at the end of the meal as opposed to during the meal. Now, I do understand that he may have been new or may even have been too slammed but shouldn't waiters and any establishment at the very least come by and ask if you were doing okay? IDK but the service wasn't on par with some other little restaurants I've been to. \n\nAs for the food, to me it really wasn't anything special. The chicken wasn't like how they make it out to be and the waffles were still kind of dough-y. I may have gone at a bad time but it's a restaurant and they should be consistent. The chicken strips weren't too bad and the best part of the meal was the fries. I gave one-star for the food and one-star for the service. \n\nI guess I was expecting a lot more from the reviews and reputation Lo Lo's had...",1
"If you are a soup fan, the minestrone soup was incredible.  Unfortunately it was a so-so experience from there on out.  After the minestrone soup (I would go back just for the soup) and hearing reviews about the sandwiches, I had high expectations of the pastrami.  The sandwich was not bad, but not great either.  At a $15 price tag and due to the reputation, I expected better.  I would not go out of my way to eat here.  If you are a sandwich fan, make your way to Earl of Sandwich at PH.  The quality is better and the price lower.",1
Pacific Moon is some of the best Chinese food that Fountain Hills has ever seen.  Their combination lo mein is unlike any other Fountain Hills has to offer.  Their crab rangoons are unbeatable too.  The staff is SO friendly and welcoming.  I bring my 1 year old son in with me and the wait staff is always so happy to see him and so understanding of his mess and demands for their attention.  Great food and Great surface.  A definite favorite of this family's!,4
"garbage!!!!! people, parking, & stores!!!!!!!!!! lol, avoid it @ all costs!!!!!!!!!!",0
"Want your froyo with retro hipster flare? This is the froyo for people who think froyo was better before it got popular, and who are now eating their froyo ironically. You may feel out of place if you don't have a Smith Brothers-style beard and some plaid.\n\nIt's perfectly nice froyo. I come here to get variants on caramel or cheesecake flavors, as it always has at least one (and not a huge range of flavors otherwise), with caramel sauce and candied pecans. It's the only froyo place where I voluntarily eat inside, as it has hipster ambient music.",3
"great customer service, wonderful salads, and great cheese curds :) I enjoyed it\n!",3
The food compare to other pho restaurant was expensive and taste BAD!! I don't mind the price of the food if it's taste good..But very disappointed!!!,0
"I don't really know what to consider this place, not quite a sit down but not really fast food either. I should say I have never actually dined in we have always ordered take out but I've never seen any table service the handful of times I've been in. The food here is good, simple and fresh. However one major suggestion if your ordering take out, always check your boxes before you leave. I learned the hard way after having my order messed up 3 out of 4 times. Other than that it's good food with reasonable prices.",3
"The only positive thing I'll say is that they changed the channel to the game we wanted to watch immediately, and to be fair, they filled up our waters constantly.\n\nAs far as the food goes... Holy wow. It was bar food that was worse than bar food. Which is unfortunate because the place is actually really clean and really nice, so I was expecting a little but more. Everything from the spinach artichoke dip, to the fish and chips, to the Philly, to the Cajun chicken pasta, it all looked and tasted like it was frozen and then microwaved. I could've made better at the age of 13.\n\nI hate to bash on here, but it seriously was a terrible experience except for the fact that my team won.",0
"I cannot say how happy I was to be able to take advantage of a Living Social deal for half off a yearly individual membership to the Heinz History Center.  It's a fun place and the exhibits are endlessly entertaining, interesting, relevant and educational. \n\nI've been a Pittsburgher all my life and places like the Heinz History Center make me excited and proud to call this city home.  It is also a cool place for not just locals but visitors from out of town as well.  In addition to great exhibits and good times, there are always events going on here (some for members only, making a membership worth the money).  And its location at the edge of the Strip District doesn't hurt, either.\n\nI've been to the History Center several times and continue to fall in love.  I may just have to renew my membership next year so I don't miss a thing.",4
"This lady treated my dog for every allergy, charging me thousands of dollars. Nothing was helping my dog feel better in the years time. After I realized my dog was suffering from merely dry skin due to all the antihistamine products and the dry climate we live in I treated my dog with fish oil topically on one side. Miraculously the dog stopped itching that side so I treated the other side. Through trial and no error I started administering Flaxseed Oil in his diet, the dog doesn't scratch. Instead of treating a dog with a 15.00 diagnoses this woman goes deep for the pockets. I don't care about the money, I care about the year that my dog was in agony. Try your home remedies before sinking your money into this dark hole.",0
"Cool little place I discovered while I was opening an account at PNC Bank that is across the street. Food is really good and the prices are unbeatable. The panini's are great and the wraps are not half bad either. I got way more than what I paid for and felt like it was a great value.\n\nI spoke with the owner who was behind the counter and he seems like a very nice guy. The guy in front of me in line apparently had his order messed up and the owner was kind enough to fix it and give it to him free of charge. Cool little local place and a great way to support local businesses. \n\nThey have no seating. The owner told me when he bought the building, the Crazy Mocha coffee shop that is next door bought the bathrooms so because of health codes, he is not allowed to have seating. TAKE OUT ONLY!!",3
"If I could give this place a negative star rating I would.  This is by far the worst restaurant I have ever attended.  First off, the wait was terrible.  We waited an hour before our entrees came out.  Just like the previous reviewer mentioned, we counted the number of times the thunder storm came on, about 5 times.  The waiter never came around to apologize nor explain the long wait.  Our water was never refilled.  Although I finally encountered the manager to report the problem, he came back 10 minutes later with no explanation and a weak apology.  The food was served at that moment.  That was the next disaster.  The chicken of my friend's chicken pasta came out overcooked and black.  I ordered a 6 oz. filet mignon and eggs and replaced the potatoes with fruit...misadvertised since the supposed filet mignon was just regular flank.  I got potatoes instead of fruit.  When I told the waiter that I had  ordered fruit, he did not apologize and in fact when he went to the kitchen I could see him glaring at me from across the restaurant....talk about creepy.  To top off the 2+ hour lunch, we received a bill with an unaccounted 3rd extra drink, nonadvertised drink refill charges, and a 18% gratuity (also not advertised).  When we told the waiter that he charged us an extra drink and that we were not informed about the extra refill charges he scoffed and told us that he would correct the mistakes.  No apologies again.  Of course, he didn't get the 18%...he's lucky he even got a dollar.  They're lucky we even stayed just to pay for their crappy food and service.",0
I met with Jason for a consultation the other day and the first thing I noticed when I walked into his shop was how clean it was! Loved it! Then I got to talking with him and looked at some of his previous work (which was totally amazing!) and he made me feel super comfortable and confidant that he will be able to give me exactly what I am looking for. I have scheduled my tattoo for the 14th of November and I am super excited!! I just know I'm going to be writing another excellent review on that day!,4
"This was the second and last time I golf here... They don't care about flow, all they care about is taking your money. I roll up to hole 1on palm course at the time we're supposed to tee off and there is a group of 4 that just teed off and then 2 groups of 4 waiting to hit.... And 2 groups pull up behind us before we even hit. It was d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu from last time I was here...an hour and a half into the round we had just finished ONLY 3 holes!!!! Completely unacceptable!!!! What does the starter do? The first time I was there I heard the starter ask the group in front of us what course they wanted to play.... Of course they chose the one we had reservations for. Clearly they do not have a list in which they go off of, or they separate all groups by 2-3 minutes. Terrible terrible... I will not come back. Needless to say I left after 3 holes, at the pace we were going, there is no way we would have finished... 3 holes an hour! No bueno. Your better off booking elsewhere.",0
"This has got to be the most ghetto post office I've ever been to. Employees are not very proffesional. The place is so dirty. Place needs a good paint job and scrub down. I understand its not in the best neighboorhood, but keep the place clean for your customers.",0
The people were friendly and the soup was good. I got the chicken tortilla and it was good Flavor. He got the lobster bisque and liked it. However the sandwich was skimpy. The kids chicken was good as not overly fried but no ketchup! How do you not have a basic condiment? The chocolate strawberry is a nice treat and good selection of fountain drinks. The price is very reasonable and for a quick lunch we would go back for soup or salad only.,2
"I probably shouldn't be writing a review on this seeing as I was so plastered the entire time i was there. There's a lot I don't remember...however, I DO remember that it seemed to have an older crowd (late twenties to mid thirties). There wasn't really much of a dance floor but me and all my girls were pretty drunk so we made one. I have to say the bathrooms were pretty cool. They were gold and sparkly and had naked women on the doors haha. Again, I was WASTED so perhaps I just thought it was cool because I was drunk. It was a nice, classy place but there are plenty of places that are WAAAY more fun in Vegas!",2
"I rarely do night life, let alone make an effort on a day I'm coming back into town after vacation. I played tourist today and came straight from arriving to Sayers because Miguel Migs, Marques Wyatt, Mark Farina with live vocals of Lisa S were spinning and a few friends wanted to go.\n\nIt's a small indoor space with a majority being couches for bottle service and a stamp sized \""dancefloor\"" in front of the stage. It does have a nice long patio overlooking the street. \n\nThe bar seems to be better than the average night club selection and their cocktail menu looks decent. I did not try a cocktail because I'm currently on a alcohol free cleanse of sorts.\n\nThe sound quality inside was definitely good. I am a fan that they are bringing in acts that I don't see headlining other clubs and lounges often. \n\nIt is what it is. If someone interesting is coming to play, I would probably be blowing through, otherwise it's not a place I would crave and seek out to hang.",2
"Been a member there for 2.5 years.  They can't seem to hold onto staff at all.  I think I've met a dozen different managers & rarely see the same people working there for over a month.  As my membership expired some punk kid tried denying me entry.  I pay for at least 12 months at a time.  Even though I've brought countless visitors & some whom have even signed up for FREE days or weeks in the past.  This high school kid wouldn't let me work out ONE day, as I didn't have my credit card with me...\nOh, and they are not 24 hours.",0
"I heard great things about this hotel but it didn't live up to its reputation. I would never stay here again. The decor was awful, you can tell it used to be an old apartment building, probably from the seventies. \n\nBut what really upset me is that they charged an early check-in fee... WHO DOES THAT! If a room is available by all means let a tired traveler in. \n\nI planned on paying about 125 plus tax  but I ended up paying well over 200 dollars for a mediocre hotel. They charge you for every they can possibly get away with. To top it off I left my extremely expensive flat iron in the room never to be found again I called and never heard back. SIGH\n\nThe only reason I would ever return to this hotel would be to eat at their restaurant.. I left Gallo Blanco a great review.",1
"The burger is alright, even though it doesn't have any flavor. I like their fries but it comes in little quantities. Overall an okay burger place but overpriced for what we got.",2
Service is not very good. Only had 1 drink refill. As for the food...if I can sum it all up in one word it would be YUCK. I'm not a fan of negative reviews but this is Vegas! Step yo game up!,0
I have come here 2 different times and they have tried to jam both of my groups into a smaller amount of tables. 1 more table would be great. First time it was a group of 15 adults and the 2nd time it was 6 adults and 1 high chair. We tried calling ahead to give them warning both times and they dont take reservations. The wait wasnt to bad either time. Food is amazing.,1
"My friends and I booked two suites for my friend's bachelor party. We thought we might as well go somewhere nice since it was a special occasion. \n\nFrom the minute we got there every employee was rude and didn't want to help in any way. Even trying to get to my room the elevator guy had to look through my ice chest and almost didn't let me bring it up. Then we finally get to the room and the ice machine was not working and there is a frig in the room but filled with the Wynn's over priced drinks and who wants that.\n\nSo to the main point of my trip and why I think everyone should boycott this hotel is because of the discrimination they showed one of my friends because of his tattoos. It was the most ignorant things I think I've ever witnessed. He was denied entry to a pool party that we all payed for because of the art work on his skin. He is not a gang member or anything like that and we were hotel guests just going to a pool party at the hotel that we payed for. The security gaurd that was kicking us out had just about as many tattoos as my friend did which was rediculous in its self. I asked him why he wasn't letting us in and he said \""We have an image to uphold\"". He also said because some of the millionaires wouldn't like to see his tattoos. I find it really hard to believe that they would care so much about my friends tattoos that they would leave and not spend any of their money there. And we payed money as well so I guess our money wasn't good enough for them. So after we left by being embarrased in front of hundreds of people we go to get our money back and they took 2 hours to reimbuse us. \n\nSo instead of us trying to provide a special weekend for our friend it turned into one difficulty after the next. I will never step foot in that hotel or casino ever again and you shouldn't either. They will treat you like second class citizens and will disriminate against you just as they did to us. Go stay anywhere else!!!!!!!!!",0
"I am writing this review on how I feel about LGO now. \n\nI had been going to LGO for over 3 years. We used to go there pretty much every weekend. The daygrinder, french crepes, commuter, yogurt parfait, vegatable sandwich were all favorites. \n\nFor some reason now, the portions are smaller and not as good. It's not just one time, but the past three times I have gone, I have been mildly disappointed with the quality of the food. For example, the yogurt parfait used to have loads of strawberries and fruit. Now, they hardly provide much fruit The daygrinder is almost 3/4 the size they used to make it. The vegetable sandwish was filled with vegetables; now, it's a disappointment. \n\nI'm glad I went to this place when there was no line and the food was good. Now the lines are long and the quality has, unfortunately, fell by the wayside. It's a shame. I'll still hold out hope that they turn back to the LGO I enjoyed going to a couple years ago. \n\nFor now, I saw au revoir LGO.",1
Terrible service! I booked a vacation this week for my 21st birthday and received a package deal that allowed myself and my party to go to dinner at Nove which was good but we were also allowed to attend to all the clubs at the Palms- that's what we paid for apparently we were only allowed to go to one club (playboy) which was horrible with 50+ men and cheesy love music... When we spoke to the manager they refused to compt us to attend at least another club for the following day. My 21st birthday was a disappointment thanks to this hotel and staff. I'll never go to this hotel again. I'm currently still here and trying to find something else to do.,0
The guys work work at longhorn waiter named Dylan when treated me and my wife so great last time we were her less then 2 months ago am not complaining about the service it was great am complaining about the regional manager Named Raul  Who did not allow me to carry my weapon I had it in my holster as soon as I walked in he approach me telling me verbally no guns allowed in the restaurant sir I understand if someone tell you but I didn't see one single posted sign in that regard if I saw one I would put in the car away locked and vehicle armed alarm turned on so I left and what made me come back again was Dylan who have me great service before and had my firearm on me too other then that I would never come back to longhorn ever again screw a place who does not support firearms I have Ben in Texas road house and they never ever have me problems even manager told I feel safer know someone like me around like the rest of the customers meaning am not the only one in their with gun on my side other had theirs too in the Texas steak house however who ever comes here ask for Dylan great server,0
Overpriced and their brisket was below average at best. Midwood Smokehouse is far better and better priced.,0
CHEEEEEEESY!!\n\nBut dammit Michael can dance!\n\nHe was super sweaty though... and at one point he did a spin move and looked like a sprinkler.  I saw the people in the front row wiping down thier arms.  It made me throw up a little in my mouth.,1
"My favorite movie theater hands down! Never packed, great employees, good snacks and don't forget $6 Tuesday's with $2 hot dogs and $2 small popcorn. We try to get to this theater as often as we can.",4
i don't get why everyone seems to love this place. service is pretty slow and the food is just ok. the emphasis seems to be on volume over quality.,1
"Lived there for a year and a half and couldn't move out soon enough.  Where do I begin.  The apartments look nice but that's where it stops.  They are not very well built, noise carries very easily you can hear every thing if someone lives above you.  Drains clog weekly, power dims off and on..constantly switching out light bulbs from power surges.  The granite counter tops are nice but who cares with all of the other problems.  Utilities are extremely expensive easily add $500 to your rent.\n\nThe neighbors are okay for the most part, however their are a decent number of kids who are completely unsupervised running around the complex, trashing the computer lab & pool areas.  Some of the dog owners there are completely disgusting leaving dog crap on the sidewalk daily.\n\nThe pool area is not bad but teenagers invite massive groups of friends over and party like its spring break half of the time.  The computer lab is a joke, printer doesn't work most of the time (which is the only reason I would go down there).  Gym is actually not bad, open 24 hours which is nice.  Parking is terrible, I cannot emphasize this enough.  I have  never rented an apartment where a space is not included in your rent.  A handful of times on weekends I would have to park at Discovery Park and walk to my apartment before I caved into paying for a covered spot.  A number of times someone would be parked there only to find that the office would accidentally assign my space to someone else.\n\nThe staff is friendly but incompetent.  They could never coordinate with the maintenance staff correctly.  Something would always be \""misunderstood\"", what work orders needed to be completed, which days, which times.  It was mind boggling how the right hand couldn't talk to the left hand.  When I gave my notice to move out they changed the locks on me the next day by accident.  In my opinion the staff is very nice but just completely untrained and unqualified to manage the property which is what leads to most of the other problems.",0
"I feel bad giving a Chipotle one star because in general it is my favorite \""fast\"" food restaurant, BUT this particular location is the wooorrrrsstttt!!!!! Easily the slowest service in Las Vegas, possibly of all the Chipotle restaurants I've ever been to. A few of the previous reviews warned not to visit during the weekday lunch hour, but it is always slow any time of day, whether there is a line or not.  Tonight I walked in at 9:15 pm, there were 5 customers in front of me, and I did not walk out with my veggie bowl until 9:30!  All due to slow customer service.  Then they had the nerve to have a tip cup by the register, really?!?  Unfortunately it is the only location any where near my home, so I don't get to have Chipotle as often as I would like.  I still give it a chance every once in a while just hoping one of these times it will be better, still waiting on that day!",0
"If you are in the Arcadia/Camelback area this seems to be the only place now that Zen 32 closed.  I went there last night, my 2nd time since they opened.  I have been to the one in Old Town many times but will not go back since the last time we got food poisoning.  \n\nI do think this location is better, but still Stingray.  The sushi is good, not great, last night we had\n\nCucumber salad\nDumplings\nTempura Veggies\nSalmon\nMackerel\nYellowtail\nStripped Bass\nCouple hand rolls\nMotorola Roll\n\nWere the juxtaposition happens is the server was so dam nice, but the food was a mess.  First we added avocado to the hand rolls and they came out with no avocado, we were brought a side of it - but still charged.  Just not the same when it is not made with it.\n\nI did order 1 more order of salmon and it took 30 mins to get, we had already paid the bill cut our losses and were getting ready to leave when the order appeared.  Overall the place is not bad by any means.  Just it lacks what many other places have.\n\nDecor is nice - very modern and still has the orange color theme, there is an awesome fish tank in the bar and the bar area is way bigger and much more accommodating.  The outside area is one of the best in the valley, lots of outdoor space to sit and drink.  I think it is a great place to hang out and enjoy happy hour, the food is consistent - Just don't expect the best.",2
better than a buffet? i think so! if you are ever in vegas you have to stop by here and try their chicken sage egg benedit. it was on man vs. food and i can finish a whole plate by myself! haha it was pretty delciious if i must say so myself.,4
"We went for lunch our first time and we had a great experience. We returned for Thanksgiving dinner and we had yet, another great experience.  Great salad bar, great meats, delicious bread, OUTSTANDING service. The sides we brought to us promptly and as we would run out of anything it was soon replaced without asking. \n\nThey are open for lunch everyday and my sweetheart and I visit every 2 weeks. Our favorite place to eat.",4
"I was abducted on a hungover Saturday morning and takin this this place. At first I was a little nervous, it's in the hood, no sign saying this is even a business, bars on the ordering windows. But hot damn, this food was good. A must for a hungover, gut soaking meal. \nI'll definitely be returning....just maybe with my gun next time. Haha jk",3
"I don't quite understand why AFTER a pedicure, my feet are now drying and peeling.  That seems really counter productive to the purpose of a pedicure.  Yes, my toe nails are now polished and shiny, but my skin is dry and flaky.  Suffice to say, I'm not a happy camper and I'm drowning my feet in moisturizing lotion.",1
"The white guy behind the counter was kind of unfriendly when we came in, we hadn't done anything but walk in the door, hadn't even opened our mouths to order yet and the guy seemed like we were really putting him out by being there, but the Hispanic guy cooking and serving was really nice to us, which is what kept my husband from walking out on the bad first impression.  I'm glad we didn't leave cause the food was great.  I got the low carb breakfast and also sampled my husband's quinoa \""oatmeal\"" (delicious with just the right amount of sweet and fresh fruit) and egg sandwich (cheese to die for and some very good chicken sausage).  My husband's complaint (beside the sort of assclowny guy behind the counter) was that the menu did not make clear that the egg sandwich was a fried egg rather than scrambled and that the oatmeal would be quinoa rather than regular oatmeal.  As we were sitting eating the CSA arrived with the days vegetable delivery.  Buying local from the farm?  No wonder it tasted so good.",2
"I stayed at the Luxor in nov of 2012 and would/will tell everyone I know, don't stay here. The hotel is at the wrong end of the strip and rooms are nothing to write home about but the worst part of my stay was the customer service. I tried gambling in the casino and was asked to show ID 4 times in less than 15min. I am 29 and understand I look young but 4 times is ridiculous and the last 3 times I wasn't gambling or drinking, just standing in the casino. When I tried to express my frustration, the manager blew me off. Horrible customer service and too many better options on the strip than to stay here ever again. Travelers beware!!!",0
"I really want to like this place, because this is the only decent eatery for government employees in that area. But I am still not warmed up to its subs after 8 months. I like the Chicken Wild Rice Soup (Wed only) though.",2
"Pros: Cheap $3 sandwiches ( they are small, so don't expect a Subway-type sandwich). Tasty.\n\nCons: Ghetto strip mall, takes cash only, no AC in summer",3
"This is just like the smaller Asian stores only much bigger.  It looks like they took over an old grocery store and just switched it over, because this place is huge.  They have tons of stuff you're definitely not going to find in the American stores.  Plus if you're feeling rustic, they sell live fish.  So, you know, you can have the satisfaction of truly making dinner from scratch, or whatever.  Anyway, I love seeing what all they have on the shelves and marveling and the wonders of a foreign culture.  Plus the Buddha statues are great, and so are the ladies who work there.  They are the take no prisoners type, so don't make them mad.",2
This place has excellent all round Chinese food. Standard fare + dumplings. We came here and ordered one of the set meal's for two and loved everything. It's also reasonably priced. Might come back to try the dumplings which we were way too full for.\n\nExcellent Chinese in Chinatown. I'd been looking for a standard fare place like this for a quite a while.,3
Pinkberry remains supreme in the world of froyo. Many froyo copycats have sprung up across America but they just don't have that perfect amount of tartness that pinkberry does so well. Call me a froyo snob but it's true! My 3 hr layover is made is made so much better after finding out there was a pinkberry here. There is not one at home so I aim to get some whenever I come across a shop. This airport one lived up to my expectations.,3
"Long waits to meet with the nurse (no doctors here).  Then she walks in and looks like a Colombian Hooker in a hooker outfit that some one threw a white coat on - stilleto heels, mini skirt, coke finger-nail and all.  Not Professional!\n\nShe kept telling us about the \""conservative\"" in the injections.  I finally asked if she meant \""PREservative\"" and she said \""oh yeah, that stuff.\""  Seriously...  RN license from a box of Cap'N Crunch?  I think so!",0
"The food at Olives is not as good as you'd expect for the price tag, but it receives 3 stars from me for the extras.\n\nFirst, the bread basket is totally yummy. There's a variety of breads to keep you happy while you wait for your meal, and each one was good. Second, the atmosphere is quite nice. It's upscale-ish without falling all over itself. Third, we were given a stellar table for a reservation made 2 hours in advance, for 12 people, on a busy Saturday night.\n\nThe food is oversalted and under-tasty. We were all happy enough with our meals, as it tasted good, but nothing about it made us feel like food is the focus at Olives. I think they are banking on the location inside Bellagio and the atmosphere to be the draw, and serving good-but-not-great food.",2
YUMMY! The pasta was very well done. The shrimp were larger than I expected and blended well with the cheese sauce. Definitely better than Olive Garden any day of the year.,4
"Remembered it being better at their old location, to be honest I was quite disappointed this last time. Probably won't be back.",1
Great brunch deal! There will be a line if you arrive later than 11 am on Sunday because a 15-bucks buffet that has tons of wonderful food and one free coffee or juice or Bloody Mary just sounds so damn good! I love their waffles and egg Benny!,3
"Excellent food and wine. The braised ribs were not as great as I expected, but good.",3
Food is barely edible......service is spotty and the place has a reputation for padding the bills and scooping up cash that does not belong to them,0
Got yelled at by a disgruntled pool attendee. Didn't want to argue. Normally I spend my entire day at the pool.  I stayed less than 1 hour.,0
"Axum happened to be my first real experience with Ethiopian food (previously I had it while going to school at an ethnic potluck dinner). I went here with a group of 8 - 10 people, one of which loved the place and was actually the one to suggest we go. When I walked it I immediately noticed that there was group of I am guessing Ethiopians sitting around the bar and no one else. The place did not look very prepared for serving restaurant patrons. So the menus come out and I guess since he had suggested the restaurant he decided to order for everyone, since he was familiar with the cuisine. I'm a little miffed at this point, but don't care enough to make a big deal about it. At least they ordered some vegetarian food.\n\nSo when the food comes out, they have these huge platters with injera, the traditional Ethiopian bread, on the bottom and the food on top. I enjoyed the experience of eating with my hands and sharing, but the food was not that great and the atmosphere totally sucked.\n\nWhen we had finished our meal, the waitress mentioned that the restaurant was under new management and handed us some business cards. I'm guessing the change of management could account for the discrepancy between Keith A's review and mine. Either that or I'm just a picky asshole. It's probably the later.",1
"Great Small Neighborhood Sushi Restaurant\n\n* Awesome Service 5 stars\nThe folks here are so nice...genuine....attentive without being annoying\nThe sushi chef is the master juggler... he does it all.... covers the counter and all the table orders... and he's 'on top of it all'\n\n* Lunch specials...starts at $6\n\n*Combo plates... didn't try them but they looked great... for $13\n\n* Fish specialities like Salmon Cheek... \nSalmon Cheek was so flavorful and different... not your ordinary fish offerings at a sushi place... that's what makes this place special... their 'Special Fish' board\n\n* The 'Wheel 'o Money'... for every $30 you get to spin the wheel for a chance to win Sushi Imagine Bucks to use on your next visit.\n\n* It's small... about 7 or 8 stools at the counter. Plus 8 fourtops. So, big parties... note that it might be hard to get a table to fit y'all\n\n* The regular fish offerings are nothing out of the ordinary.  I'd only give them 3 stars based on the regular selections... the yellowtail, salmon and tuna were not the best that I've ever tasted but it was good\n\n*  Price...not super expensive... not super cheap.... the rolls range from $9-12...\n\n*The rolls were well crafted and not overly sauced so I'm on board...and the sushi chef asks you how spicy you want the sauce... that's awesome!\n\n* The Ginger was not my favorite... it had too much of a 'bite' to it... I like my ginger sweet, crisp and refreshing",3
"Well - I am SO glad I didn't read any reviews on Yelp before booking, because I would have missed out on a fantastic weekend! My heart goes out to all you Yelpers who had horriffic experiences, but I must have hit the jackpot because our stay was so wonderful!\n\nI arrived early - 12pm - and check-in didn't start until much later. I got in line with high hopes. The lady up front suggested I register for a Total Rewards card which would allow me to bypass the early check-in fee when they had a room available. I left my bags with the bellhop and made my way into the casino. It reminded me of the casinos back home in MN, kind of old, and wasn't terribly flashy like I had fantasized them to be. However the (free) drinks were strong and there were PLENTY of people around which gave me reassurance this was still a great place to hang out. After an hour of day-drinking and gambling away $10, I decided to try for a room. I got to stand in the TR line (versus the regular line with about 30 people in it). I was helped immediately and went right up to my room. \n\nOur room - was honestly fantastic. I wonder (reading previous reviews) if all of the rooms are in a state of renovation of some sort, whether it is the bathroom or the beds or whatnot - but ours was pristine. The bathroom was huge! The shower was large as well, the sink was clean and enough counter space for 3 women.\n\nThe beds were almost too-comfy and kind of sank in the middle - but I didn't come to Vegas to SLEEP! The stereo system worked well, and the view of Caesar's Palace was perfect. My only complain in the room is that the outside of the windows were pretty dirty, but whatevs.\n\nMy checklist for a Vegas hotel is as such:\n\n1) good location - CHECK (very central to all the action)\n2) clean room - CHECK (make sure to get at least a GO room)\n3) moderately priced - CHECK ($590 for 3 nights and 3 people = ~ $200 each)\n4) pool - CHECK (the GO pool had lots of space, clean, good music)\n\nReally the Flamingo has a lot to offer - if you want a Resort-type feel of luxury, I would not recommend. But for a good price and awesome location in the middle of all the action, you can't do better in Vegas.\n\n**OH! And a Strip View is COMPLETELY WORTH THE UPGRADE CHARGE! Trust me!!",3
Been there twice so far and I already see a huge difference.  Love this place Jill makes you feel at ease. The prices are great too. I have told my friends about her and are excited to go get laser done.,4
"I went to get a pre-natal massage & facial. I started off with my facial & it was amazing very relaxing I fell asleep it was just a standard basic facial there was no extractions which I found strange but still relaxing, ask for Amanda she was great. Then I had Maggie for my massage & Wow!!! She was good I love more pressure like deep tissue & especially bring pregnant I was worried that I would get a bad massage. I was not disappointed at all. I will go back just to see her again. I have been here before and left feeling disappointed by other massage therapists and only went back because of the yelp check in offer for $35 for a 50 min massage I couldn't pass it up & now I will continue to go back as long as Maggie is there :)",3
"This place is pretty good! The food is surprisingly good for it's low key yet clean atmosphere. The dinner rolls are not on the menu, but they are to die for! Really like their salad. The reason I gave it 3 stars instead of four is because the service is not so organized. First of all, they got a lot of people's orders wrong. Secondly, they overcharged people in my party left or right. When I went back to complain about being overcharged, they charged me for the corrected price but never voided the uncorrected charge causing my credit card to be placed on fraud alert and placed on hold. A huge headache for a bunch of incompetent waiters and management. Pretty disappointing for such an amazing JW Marriott...",2
"I came here so many times! I was either buying gifts or trying food, but mostly gifts and I tried them. There are so many things that you can buy here, but they're all not labeled so you'll catch yourself asking, \""What is this?\"" a lot. Here are my reviews on the different products. \n\n1. Gelato (Coconut, pistachio, and mango) - Meh... Too sweet and rich. Half a  scoop is enough for me and I'm a sweets junkie. Also, the pistachio hardly tasted like pistachio. 2 scoops for me and 1 scoop for my friend = $9ish. \n\n2. Carrot cupcake - It was very weird. They baked it in a cup and had some kind of divider on top and topped it with dome-shaped frosting. It was tasty though. (They have complimentary candles if you need them). Be aware that they do not look like cupcakes so you will walk pass them without even knowing.\n\n3. Chocolate mousse - Very rich, but what do you expect? It's mousse!  The cupcake and mousse = $13. \n\n4. Marshmallows - I got it because my bf loves marshmallows and I had to try it because they were $22!!! Anyway, my opinion on it is that it's nothing special. Don't get it. \n\n5. Butterfingers - Yummy, but they don't taste like Butterfingers. The taste is not as distinct.  This was $18 and overpriced.",2
"In a word...grody.\n\nThe second I walked in the door I was lambasted by a serious stank. It smelled like sewage and industrial cleaners. I should have done an about face at this time but I foolishly pressed on.\n\nI ordered the Red Devil white calzone, which was advertised as mozzarella, olive oil, fresh Roma tomatoes and garlic. The mozzarella was over abundant and flavorless, the tomatoes were mealy, underripe and were decidedly not Romas (likely Beefsteak or Mountain Pride). The garlic was nearly raw and jammed into the calzone by the fistfull. \n\nI'm not a restaurateur but in my estimation the two most oft repeated sins of Italian restaurants is to not make their mozzarella in house and to overload every dish with garlic. Mozzarella is easy and inexpensive to make and I love garlic but there is definitely such a thing as too much.\n\nI will not be returning to this location. However it should be noted that I ate at the Pinetop location last year and both the food and the ambiance were excellent.",0
"Never going here again. HORRIBLE! \nI took my boyfriend for dinner here for his birthday because it was his first time. First of all our waitress Bree looked like she was on 10 cups of coffee, and secondly the family right behind us were really upset because Bree lost their credit card which was what they payed for I'm assuming. Ugh who loses a credit card!?!? Ok so now to our issues, well we both asked for waters and she asked \""with lemon\"" we both said yes she' comes back with 2 water one with lemon and one without lemon she's said \"" oh I forgot I didn't know if u wanted it with lemon or not\"" so I said it's ok no worries, then while my boyfriend was not looking I told her it's my boyfriends birthday today she's winked back and said \"" ok got it\"" as were having our dinner she boxes up our food and Says \""any dessert for tonight\"" I said yes \""plain cheesecake\"" she's said \""I'll bring that right out for you\"" as I waited and waited and WAITED they never came and sang happy birthday to my boyfriend and she brought us our tab and I said uhhh did u forget our cheesecake she's said\"" oh yea I'll bring it right up\"" This was really upsetting due to the fact that it was my boyfriends birthday, she DID not deserve our tip she was a horrible waitress. Were never going back to this bucca de beppo. Flamingo location is way better. *Thumbs down*",0
"This was my first time renting with this company, and - even with the problems we had with the reservation and my corporate card - I am a fan.\n\nI flew into Phoenix from Seattle to get an SUV and deliver some crates to Bend, OR. I would then drive the vehicle to Seattle and fly home from there. Not easy arrangements to make, but they had the best deal, so we went with it.\n\nOnce in PHX, they didn't have an SUV. Paul, the young gentleman at the counter, said he'd find something for me, so I described the size of the cargo and he made a phone call. He said, \""Looks like you get a free upgrade!\"" Unfortunately, with the upgraded hold on the credit card, all we got was smoke from the machine.\n\nIt seems that the deposit they require on your CC is DOUBLE the amount of the entire rental. Ouch. I had to call my employer and ask if they could raise my limit. Sixt does not take debit cards, even for double the amount.\n\nAll told, the CC issue took a couple of hours. I didn't want to take it out on Paul, who was not only professional, but very helpful and sweet. He was even willing to call the competition to see if they had an SUV for me.\n\nWe go the limit raised, and getting the car itself took minutes. Paul said he had hung onto the upgrade (even though other SUVs had come in during our wait), because I deserved it. They honored the original price.\n\nI enjoyed the long drive in my BMW.\n\nDrop off at SEA was easy-peesy, and I was on my way to TSA with no delay.",3
"Came on a Groupon so it was definitely worth the price, although at the regular ($30/pp) I'm not sure it would have seemed as great. \n\nThe concessions weren't too overpriced considering the size of the meals. The secret winner here are the fries- SO GOOD! Nice and small and crispy without being dry. \n\nThey need a little better consistency and display of the rules. Our daughter got smacked with the short stick pretty hard, but we are a swimming family. Both husband and I were on swim teams growing up and our daughter is an excellent swimmer. The first time we went in the wave pool no one said anything to/about her height (about 43\"" at almost 7 years old). The second time there was someone at the entrance with a measuring stick and told her she had to wear a life jacket for being under 48\"". She was very upset and felt like a baby. The only sign posted outside the wave pool says non-swimmers must be accompanied by a parent and can not go past the 3ft mark. They need to post their actual requirements and have consistency with the lifeguards monitoring entry & height requirements. There was a pretty good variety of slides that she was able to ride for her height, though. Overall it was a good time.",2
"This is the mechanic you want to see if you are mechanically-challenged or if you are a girl who knows a little about cars! ;) Greg is honest, trust-worthy, and really easy going. He will get you back on the road in no time AND tell you what you need to watch for down the road. He's a good guy! If you're in Mesa, I highly recommend him (and believe me, when I say I've been through the ringer with car mechanics this year and this is a HIGH recommendation!)! I will coming back to him in the future most definitely!",4
"Not impressed.   Brought my car in last week as it is making a weird noise, they said they couldnt even tell me what it is unless I pay $490!!

"This is an extremely strange and expensive bar in the Mandalay Bay mall.  You walk into the front of the store and choose a package which includes a jacket, gloves, boots and one drink for $25 each.  They also have a package which includes 2 drinks for $35 and a VIP package which includes a picture and some other useless stuff.  You also have the option to upgrade to a fur jacket.  After you dress up in your Eskimo suit, they lead you to the back into a 32 degree room and then into the room with the freezing bar.  The freezing bar room is very cold (5 degrees Fahrenheit).  It is very cold, but not miserably cold--at least not in the time it took me to finish one drink.  They seem to specialize in martinis so our entire group had various sorts of martinis served in ice glasses.  The drinks were very good and the bartender was very friendly and helpful.   Vodka choices included in our $25 package included Absolute, Stoli or some house brand.  They had many more premium vodkas to choose from, but they were all extra, so I stuck with Stoli.  The bartender works in that room for a full 8 hour shift and has for 2 years.  There is no time limit so you can take as long as you want to finish your drink.  Or you can order more because they leave your credit card open until you leave the bar area.  The bar room was decorated in ice with windows allowing you to look out into the mall at the regular people not in our igloo.  It is cool and strange and I would recommend it, but I probably would not do it again.  It's a unique experience, but not worth the money to do it twice.  Plus it's really cold and I don't think I could stand to be in there for two drinks.  Drinks-4 stars, Ambiance-5 stars, Service-4 stars, Value-1 star.",2
"I booked a room at Bill's because of the Yelp reviews. They said it was clean, comfy and got the job done. Too bad I will never know how Bill's actually is because they booted me over to the Imperial Palace (*Note: Bill's=4 starts, IP=2.5 stars, yet I had to pay the same price.)\n\nWe had arrived in Vegas early but didn't want to pay to check in early, so we waited until the ridiculously late 4 pm check-in time. When we got there, they told us that they would be moving us to the Imperial Palace. No explanation, no nothing. So after about 10 minutes of questioning Carletta at the front desk, she told us that it was because there were plumbing problems. But who knows.... Anyways, Carletta was kind enough to give us some wrong directions, so it took us about 30 minutes to get to the IP, which we could have walked in 5. But the awesomeness was just getting started!\n\nLet me just say that the IP was nothing short of awful. I mean, it got the job done (as in, we weren't sleeping on the street...which might actually have been cleaner), but the room was dirty, TERRIBLE lighting (how are 7 girls supposed to get ready in a room with 2 dull lamps?), the staff was extremely rude and unhelpful, and I had to wait 15 minutes to check in and 30 minutes to check out (Not including the time I spent figuring out that they checked someone else out instead of us and going back to have it fixed). Because of this dilemma they upgraded us to a room reserved for Diamond Club members. What special amenities did this \""upgraded\"" room have? A coffee pot.....thanks......\n\nAnyways, there was a problem with my bill, so I called Bill's and was on hold for about 10 minutes. Then someone answered the phone and promptly hung up once I said hello. \n\nI am debating whether or not to even call to complain or try to get a partial refund because I doubt they will give a crap. It's nice that other people had such wonderful stays at Bill's, but I for one would suggest that you don't risk it. Yes it might be clean and comfortable and cheap(-ish), but wouldn't you rather stay somewhere where you'll actually be taken care of?",0
"My buddy and I came in from out of town and had a great experience here. The legendary Master Go is a great instructor, the facility was clean and had a lot of equipment (not that I used any of it) and was well air-conditioned. \n\nThe guys who train there were all super cool, and were really good. I got good and WRECKED by a few guys (in a good way, no musclehead ego aholes), and left extremely happy. We did two classes there, can't wait to get back to Vegas to roll with Sims' crew.",4
"My thing is Rolled tacos, but this place won't saisfy anybody's craving for that food item. THey were undercooked and limp in the middle and never contained any of the promised cheese. They were quite skimpy on the Guac too esopecially considering their $4 pricetag. Horchata was also the wrong color - suppose to be white, but it was brown here. Beware. Owner is freaky nice, but he kept saying, \""nice to see you\"" but I was never ever there before. A little strange. Longshot any of the other stuff is good, so its onto the next one.",1
"Glass Nickel is a great value.  I came back to the hotel after class ended  for lunch.  I had decided to take it easy before exploring near-by.   So looking through the restaurant options that provided delivery to the hotel, the menu of Glass Nickel jumped out at me.  I decided to have Nickel Nuggets (basically bites of bread with marina sauce) and 'home-made' meat lasagna.  The lasagna came with a side salad.  All this for $12.40, cool. \n\nWhen the food arrived, I was very surprised.  It was a lot (could have possible feed at least 3-4) of food.  I was expecting about 10 Nickel Nuggets; there were too many to count.  Honestly, the handful I had didn't seem to make a dent (I guess they could be multiplying in the box, but I don't think so.)  The lasagna was delicious, it lived up to the expectation that 'home-made' had given me.   \n\nThis is a great place to have in a college town.  Cheap, good food that lasts for two or three meals (even if you don't get the Nickel Nuggets).\n\nGuess, I have a decision in front of me.  Do I eat more of it for dinner tonight, or do I go some new to feed the yelping need?  Stay tuned for the answer.",3
"In Vegas for work, looking for something vegan ... most steakhouses have great veggie sides and I was not disappointed at Old Homestead.\n\nI ordered the heirloom beet salad - without goat cheese - wow, it was so good!  Perfectly prepared beets and the vinaigrette was nice and tangy.\n\nFor my \""entree\"" I ordered a side of mushrooms, broccoli, asparagus, and the roasted corn - outstanding.  The corn was definitely the best, the others were pretty standard fare.\n\nMinus a star for no vegan entree (not a surprise though) and no dessert.  Most places at least have a sorbet.\n\nPricey, yes ($100+ for my meal, plus 2 glasses of wine!), but it is a nice place, great ambiance, even dining solo at the bar.  Kudos to the staff for not making me feel lame for ordering just veggies in a steak place.  They were very kind & accommodating.  Much appreciated!",2
Typical Denny's food but this one had good service. It was 2am and we couldn't find any other place that was open.,2
I have been here twice and both visits were enjoyable.  The food is amazing and the portions are generous.  It is fun to order and share among friends since there is such a variety on the menu - definitely many flavors to suit every palate.  The salsa bar is eclectic and amusing and brings a great point of conversation to the table.\n\nThis is a great addition to downtown Glendale.\n\nI was disappointed by the slow service provided at both visits.  The staff plays music from an mp3/iPod but we had to ask several times to turn it down because we could not even here each other talk over the volume of the music.  It was a feature that I could have done without.  These are easy fixes for the management and staff.,3
"Awesome Indian restaurant in a convenient location. Friendly host, very attentive wait staff and excellent food. My Chicken Vindaloo was really spicy, but at least the waiter DID warn me beforehand.\n\nI saw that some reviews were complaining about portion sizes and menu pricing, but I like to think of it as a quality-over-quantity type of thing. I wasn't too shocked by the prices. The food comes in the usual little copper dishes found in Indian restaurants, so if you're used to those you won't be in for any surprises.\n\nWell worth checking out if you're ever in Montreal and you're a fan of Indian cuisine.",4
"Be prepared to wait even if you are the only customer, but it's worth it. The food is made to order and tastes homemade. I love the refried black beans. My husband and I usually share the sampler platter...we love the variety. The food is interesting. For instance, a pickled cabbage slaw is served with all dishes. The plantain chips, stuffed pepper, Papusas, and ceviche with fresh chips are also good. The only thing I haven't loved was the onion chicken. I definitely recommend if you are in the neighborhood!",4
"This place is next to Hell's Half Acre so I believe they should rename it Hell Hole because that is what this place resembles. I went into this place because of the signage outside the restaurant that mentioned their happy hour currently being served. After being seated, I waited for twenty minutes before I got up and had to ask for service. After being greeted, I was informed there was no happy hour despite the multiple signs advertising it. The food took forever and was not very good. The quesadilla was a tortilla with a piece of cheese in it. The menu said it had guacamole but mine did not come with anything on it. The tortilla and slice of cheese cost about 11 dollars. This place is a disaster and they do not seem to care.",0
"Good wings, no gluten-free pizza (yet), and an unassuming salad bar.  The kids section is very helpful when trying to devour two dozen wings in under five minutes.",2
"We ate here for our 3rd Wedding Anniversary! For an Appetizer we had the Duck Quesadillas with grapes and blackberries, I chose the New York Strip with horseradish mashed potatoes and greens. Very delicious! Though we didn't indulge they had a large selection of wines that are sure to please. Thumbs up Table 34, you were good.",3
Typical retirement course. The greens were in good shape. Had some challenging holes which was nice. A good value for Phoenix in the middle of winter when golf prices are outragous.,2
"I am not a fan.  Perhaps it is the proximity to the superior Wynn, which seems to have luxury AND a soul.  Or maybe I just don't like themeless slot warehouses that set their sights so low as to try to imitate a boring Beverly Hills luxury mall in their design.  Look!  We've got overpriced glittery stuff!  With Eye-talian labels!  Fancy!   \n\nPalazzo gets one star for the funky little jazz bar next to the Jersey Boys Theater, that place rocks.  The rest of the place is like the Nordstroms of Vegas casinos.  Bleh.",0
"I want to rate higher but just can't. The food is ok, except the Nachos which are amazing, the service is ok, but the prices (for what you get) are too high. Can't really recommend.",1
"In Vegas for Super Bowl and my buddies and I stopped in at the Rock House to have some drinks and get something to eat.  We were promptly seated by the hostess and it went downhill from there.  We waited nearly 20 minutes before a waitress showed up.  We had waited so long we had all decided what we were going to eat in addition to our drinks.  She took our drink orders but refused to take our food order also.  Another 10 minutes elapsed before our drinks arrived by another waitress who also declined to take our food order.  We waited approximately 30 minutes before another waitress showed up to take our food order.  The ironic thing is the restaurant was nearly empty.  Food arrived rather quick but it was so bad I could not finish my chicken and avocado sliders.  It tasted like gas station food.  I asked for the tab so I could get out of there because the service and food  was so bad.  It took nearly an hour.  I finally got a hold of two separate servers before our bill was presented.  I do not recomemmend Rock House.  There is an obvious problem with management and training.  Staff was rude.  Bottom line, eat somewhere else.",0
"OMG I'm stuffed.  I think I need a wheelchair to get around the office now...O gawd!\n\nSo my coworker took me out to lunch today, and this is where she took me.  Its right outside of my office, so all we really have to do is cross the street to get to it.  I've been in here before, and always love it.\n\nPlace is obviously well decorated.  Service is quick and friendly.  I liked thier menu selections.  ordered a cheeseburger, which came with fries!  I loved the presentation of it!  Fries came in a brown baggie!  My friends Mayo came in a tiny little one serving bottle.  Very pleasing to the eyes!   \n\nFood here is tasty, and delicious!  On the fancier side for having a burger, but Im not to much of a fancy eater these days. The burger itself was really delicious.  I got it with Cheese.  The only thing is that the fries were horribly oversalted!! UGH.  I couldn't even finish them!  My one coworker who eats here all the time said that the fries are always WAY to salty and is unsure of who to talk to about it.  Being that I dont eat here often, Im not sure either..plus, since Im not a regular, I dont want to go in there and be like \""hey your fries are ALL ENTIRELY salt\"" and then leave....blah. Anyways...\n\nPlace was great, will return in a heartbeat!",3
"In town for a conference, and after a great lunch here 2years ago, suggested our group try it for dinner.\n\nThe wait was tolerable with our reservation, but the room was over filled and screaming loud. Services was slow due probably to the crowded dinning room, but Joel was attentive and helpful.\n\nCome hungry, portion sizes were huge!\n\nWine list is on an iPad, which was going dead...a little more attention to detail may be helpful.\n\nLunch experience was much better than dinner.",2
"Last night marked the second time in a week that I waited 30 minutes or more for a 71B in the freezing cold rain.   I was 5 minutes early for the bus I was trying to catch.  I can understand a delay during rush hour, but this was not.  The bus was running every 20 minutes both times, according to the PAT schedule. When I gave up last night and went into my apartment, it was an additional 10 minutes before the bus went by...So let's review: I waited a total of 45 minutes for a bus that was supposed to be coming past every 20 minutes.  For shame!\n\nFrom now on, I'll be hoofing it across the East End instead of buying a bus pass.  It will be cold, but at least I'll be moving.",0
"$35 per person for brunch- $47 including unlimited mimosas and Bloody Mary's. \n\nI've been to Vegas a couple dozen times, but this was only my second time to a Vegas buffet. We had waited for 30 minutes the previously morning for The Henry (also in the Cosmo), so when we had a limited time to grab breakfast, the buffet seemed like a solid, quick option.\n\nThe food was pretty good with lots of live stations. I liked that none of the food seemed to be sitting and there was fast turnover. The Asian station was lack luster, but the breakfast items and the fried chicken (served in a tiny fryer basket) where the highlights. Chefs were also happy to make custom items (for example, I wanted a benedict without sauce). \n\nDesserts were in small individual serving sizes, including some gluten free options. \n\nBe sure to check to see if you can redeem points from your stay before shelling out full price.",2
"The Grapefruit Martini was good, the atmosphere was unique.  A friend who use to live in Vegas brought me here, because she wanted to feel like a local again.  I am not sure if I would go out of my way to check this place out, but if you are looking for a great place a little off the strip, you should check this place out.",3
"I don't know what it is about Eteaket that didn't WOW me.  I mean, it's clean and has a great list of teas but, I don't know, something was missing.  Maybe it had to do with feeling like I was in a chain.  Something about the colouring ... I don't know, in my head tea rooms should be a bit like pubs - warm, inviting, kind of funky.  Eteaket didn't really tick any of those boxes for me.\n\nMy tea (green Earl Gray) was quite nice, as was the box of creme caramel rooibos that I bought on the rave recommendation of Cressida F.  A bit pricey though - over a tenner for two pots of tea and a box to take away?  That's not too bank account friendly.\n\nAll in all it's nice, but doesn't quite give me the tingling feeling that I was hoping for.  Maybe next time I'll just opt to buy a box for home.",2
The food is great & the service is even better.  \n\nI highly recommend this place.,4
"This store is well put together and in a shopping center close to rite-aid,red bowl Asian bistro, wendys,pizza hut, Bojangles and etc....clean store and very easy to find things...",3
Ended up here when other nearby places had a long wait and we were quite hungry. Should have taken into account that there was nobody eating in this place. Food was just kind of blah and the service was lacking both inspiration and perspiration.,0
"This was a great reminder of why I shop online:\n\nI purchased a shirt from here and I was putting it and modeling to myself in the mirror - like \""who's a stud!?! This guy that's who!\"" When I noticed a huge tear down the middle-side of the shirt! I recalled the day prior when I purchased the shirt that it did not have any tags on it, so I started to get the feeling that someone probably returned it and it was half-checked out and then put back on the floor where I happened to find it and buy it.  Now an hour before my flight leaves, I'm sitting outside the CK store because they told me they cannot allow me in the store until 9am.\n\nThe moral of the story - I have purchased many things online - NEVER had an issue. No lines, no people holding up the line talking about \""it said in the window there, there is a storewide sale!?!\""  Nothing.",1
"Not unique, particularly interesting [or ahem . . . original], the Original Pancake House is basically a diner with a wider variety of pancakes to choose from.\n\nDon't get me wrong, I'm not opposed to a place with cornucopia of pancake choices, but none of the food was great.  The blueberry pancakes just weren't remarkable and the blueberries weren't fresh or flavorful.  They came with a dusting of powdered sugar, which was a nice touch, but all in all the pancakes were blah.  The Continental Crepe was similarly mediocre -- the actual crepe was good, but was overwhelmed by too much sour cream in the filling.  The side of \""German potatoes\"" was also surprisingly flavorless.  In the end, the only remarkable part of the meal was the side order of bacon -- quality pork with perfect crispness.\n\nBottom line: if you can't think of anywhere else to grab breakfast, the Original Pancake House isn't the worst place to eat.",1
"Completely disappointed. I used to frequent a restaurant in Oakland, Hello Bistro, that has a similar concept to Toss't but is much better. The staff wasn't very friendly, they rushed me out of the restaurant (even though in was the only person in there at the time), the ingredients were no where near as fresh as they claim them to be, and it was way over priced. I had to give it one star but if I could I would give it zero. I'm sorry to say this, but I would never go back and I wouldn't recommend this place to anyone.",0
"I was happy to see a sushi place that I haven't tried, but was sad after I tried Osaka last night. My standard sushi rolls were simply flavorless and the wasabi was not spicy. The place has a cozy layout and seems to be getting decent reviews, so I plan on giving it another chance.",1
"MY ABSOLUTE FAVORITE ITALIAN RESTAURANT!!!! \n\nI've been going here for years! Ever since I was going to the real estate school next door, at their Sahara location (i believe this location is their only one now). I used to always get a couple slices of cheese pizza, and I was always amazed at how delicious a simple cheese pizza can be! They obviously use the best ingredients in order for something so simple to taste so amazing!\n\nI've since moved to Los Angeles, BUT I DEFINITELY make plans to visit Montesano's every time I'm in town! TRUST ME WHEN I SAY THEY MAKE THE BEST PIZZA AND CAPRISI SALAD I'VE EVER HAD!!! I haven't tried much else since I don't get to go there that often anymore, I usually stick to pizza and caprisi salads. I remember the first time i took my girlfriend here, it was back in January, and she ordered the Carprisi salad (i hadn't had it prior) and it blew us both away! So this last time I visited them just several days ago, my girlfriend and i each ordered the Carprisi salad AND a small pizza. \n\nYou guys get my point, this place is a gem buried in a hay stack! I used to live in Las Vegas, so i realize there is SOOOOO much competition in that town! Especially since tourists never leave the strip therefore making business even harder for places like Montesano's! I found this place by accident, and my mission now is for EVERYONE who can get to that side of town to try them! It's worth it! THE BEST PIZZA YOU'LL EVER HAVE, the freshest ingredients make for the best pizza, it's simple yet so many places manage to mess it up. \n\nTheir service alone would make me go back, very friendly, they treat you like family here. I believe it's run by two brother and a sister. I think one of the brothers names is Sammy and the sisters name is Tony. I've yet to meet the other brother. Tony was there last time we went, she's extremely nice, and like I mentioned before, treats you like family, like someone she's known for a very long time. \n\nThe atmosphere is perfect too! The place is just the right size and they have all booths, making your dining experience intimate with the people you're with. Funny italian posters don the walls here. \n\nBTW, they have wonderful Italian sweet here too!!!\n\nI can go on and on and on about this place, I wish them all the best and I hope to go back VERY VERY soon! TO ANYONE FROM MONTESANO'S THAT MAY READ THIS... Thank you for your hospitality, your great food and for making my trips to vegas that much more worth it! See ya'll soon!",4
"We stayed here a few years back while attending a conference and it was one of the worst hotel experiences ever.  We reserved a non smoking room with a king bed.  Checked in went up the stupid and slow \""inclinator\""  which had a huge line due to its slowness because of the angle it goes up at.  Hay engineering geniuses how about putting the real elevators in the middle so you won't have to go up at a 12 degree angle.  We get to our room and it has 2 full beds and stinks.  My wife was pregnant at the time so this didn't work. \n\n Back to the front desk where they explain they can't guarantee the room you book, now thats customer service for you!  They were kind enough to find us a room in the tower with a king bed which is fine with us as you even get to use a big boy elevator that goes up and down.  The room looked fine.  That night though we find out that the mattress is horrible and you can feel the springs poking into your back.  To top it off we get the stupid f-ing ass hole inconsiderate drunk stupid f-ing frat boys that come in at 1 in the morning hooting and yelling.  Why in the hell do hotels make the walls that thin, especially in Vegas? I was glad to get out of that shit hole",0
Lou Gordon and the entire staff at Schumacher European have made my car buying experience SO easy and stress free. They never made me feel rushed or pressured and were extremely patient with me as I indecisively test drove car after car and e-mail and called with questions for the past month. Lou was honest and up-front at all times and I never felt like I was being taken advantage of. So thankful to have ended up at Schumacher!,4
"Ok words can't quite describe just how good I think this place it. My parents were in town for thanksgiving and then back again a few weeks later for graduation. After coming to Roka for the first time thanksgiving weekend my dad's first idea for dinner when they got back to town was to come again.\n\nThe family favorite on the menu is either the rice and mushroom hot pot or the butterfish. Both are fantastic. I could eat the hot pot for lunch alone. Nothing we had in either visit was bad but the let down was probably the kimchi dumplings, not becuase they weren't good but because all the other food just blew us away. The waygu beef sushi was fantastic and just melts in your mouth. Even the miso soup is better than any I have had before.\n\nOne of the best touches I saw was fresh grated wasabi coming with an order of tuna. I had never seen it grated right from the root before, only the green paste. It's small touches like this that makes Roka a step above the rest.\n\nThe housemade drinks (i think it's call surgue) are very good but they also have a very nice selection of alcohols. A martini with the ginger vodka is a great choice.\n\nThe service is also top notch with drinks being filled promptly, menu items being very well explained and just a great dining experience.\n\nHands down this has become a top 5 family favorite restaurant for us, worldwide.",4
"Stayed at Platinum May of 2008.\n\nPlatinum is a very chic property. It doesn't look like much from the outside, but once you get inside, it definitely has a classy feeling. There's a little bar/lounge to your left as soon as you get in. My buddies and I dropped our luggage off at the bell hop and walked the strip and returned about an hour later.\n\nThe front desk was pretty friendly, but nothing out the ordinary or especially exceptional about their service. We get up to our room and it's absolutely immaculate completely furnished like a stylish condo. Full kitchen, fridge, living area with a couch, flat screen TV. Our beds were in a separate bedroom and the room and the bed was extremely comfortable. The bathroom was just huge, with a GIGANTIC hot tub in the room along with a nice shower separate from it. There were robes ready in the closets. I got the hot tub ready and soaked in for a bit of time and relaxed... I threw on my robe and felt like a million bucks. I felt like a penny went I took it off and realized there was a dead bug on it. \n\nThe property has a restaurant on one of the floors, right next to the swimming pool area. The service at the restaurant was pretty awful.. I think they were short staffed because the person who appeared to be the manager was running around with his head chopped off. It took forever to get our food, but it tasted decent. (Go elsewhere on the strip for a more satisfying breakfast experience).\n\nThe swimming pool at the property is pretty nice, but it's small. But it wasn't a big deal because I realize it would only be occupied by the hotel guests. Half of the pool was indoors which was pretty cool. Aside from the indoor spot, there wasn't enough shade in the outdoor portion. The bar at the swimming pool had nightclub drink prices... Rip off.. Just buy a few bottles of liquor and mixers, throw them in the fridge, and make your own drinks. \n\nThe other thing one of my friends took advantage of was the Massage Therapy. You don't have to leave the property to be pampered. It seems they have all the things you need at this hotel, which seems to be convenient. I'm guessing my buddy enjoyed it because he went 2 or 3 times within one trip (He said the massage therapists were very attractive). But don't expect a happy ending here ;)\n\nOverall Platinum was very nice. Very clean, very quiet, and the rooms are large and beautiful. The thing I didn't like much was the location on the strip and it gets real boring. I think it would be good for a couple to get away and stay in, but for a group of party goers, it's a little too tame for Vegas. I've always enjoyed staying at casino properties because you can just take the elevator down and get a drink, gamble or hit a 24 hour coffee shop. You can't do that in Platinum. If you don't mind long walks to get anywhere, you might be fine, but I found myself taking cabs like crazy from this property.\n\nIf you're looking for a more tame, intimate or relaxing experience, I would recommend Platinum, but if you're looking to party and be near a party at all times, I would recommend a hotel property in a casino.",3
"This hotel is in a good location on the Las Vegas strip. I stay here maybe every other month. It is overpriced in my opinion but that is what you get for staying in Las Vegas. The bathrooms are great with a tube an shower, seep rate toilet room, an his/her sinks. My favorite part of this hotel is having a view of the water show. I never get tired of it!",3
"Wings were the perfect size, but the Buffalo sauce was bland, and the wings were greasy. Great atmosphere, hip decor, but the country music was a total turnoff. Clientele was 60+, but where else in the far west end of Grand Ave can you get 3 beers and wings for under $20? Please tell me- I'd rather be there.",2
"I'm a huge fan of Jamaican food having a really good friend from the island that spoils me with authentic recipes that have passed down through generation in his family and traveling all over the world my palette is internationally known lol! \n\nBack to the story, needless to say my taste buds were going crazy with expectation! Well dannng, my girlfriend and I stood at the podium long enough to pull up Yelp and read several mixed reviews, since we had been noticed yet NO ONE was coming over to greet us we started toward the empty bar with one guy seated and a totally empty lounge area when we noticed the sign, \""Please wait for server to be seared including the bar\"". So we waited and waited and waited until someone- anyone would make eye contact with us, finally a waitress approached us and asked if we have a reservation, I snickered like really, my girlfriend said no we do not and she stated it would be a wait haha okaaaay so we waited only shortly though. \n\nOnce at the table we began browsing the drink menu in search of the Jamaican rum Wray&Nephew which they did so cool now as for the menu, we both noticed the absence of jerk wings hmm we thought maybe we'll ask our server. The server approached our table with a mouthful of the day's special selection and a great grasp of the menu, very impressive so we ordered Admiral's Punch and some starters: She had the Roasted Plantains with Chutney dip and I had the Baked Mango Fish Rolls. The plantains were soft not crisp and void of flavor as for my fish rolls they were pretty good but the fish was over cooked. The drinks were a bit weak until we added shots of Wray&Nephew. \n\nSo as we sat sipping, a man stopped by our table and asked if we were enjoying our food, we looked at each other and she asked why jerk wings weren't served on the starter menu. The islander became very defensive explaining \""his island eats the whole bird not just part of it\"", my girlfriend rebutted, having spent a lot of time in Jamaica feasting on local island cuisine as well as falling in love with the jerk wings! Wellll this stuck a nerve and to be quite honest I don't think he was expecting a real reply to his question just pretending to care. \n\nNeedless to say, in life you meet some people that try so hard to upscale their image that they lose the true essence of their identity! Oh and he was rude because he kept wanting to rush off as if the place was packed lol! \n\nWARNING:  the only people that would be impressed by the food are those that have never truly experienced \""real\""Jamaican cuisine. And to think their \""philosophy: Our philosophy is that good food should be good to eat...\"", my point exactly!\nIn case you're wondering the one star was for having actual Jamaican rum!",0
"Everything here was great. My scallops were cooked to perfection the pasta and veggies were a perfect accent. I don't eat oysters, but my date insisted that I share a dozen with him so I agreed and a few days later I find myself craving them. Needless to say, the oysters were very fresh and delicious. Service was quick and attentive. I have nothing bad to say about this place, except that we walked around in circles until we found it. No one at the Venetian or Palazzo gave very good directions, or maybe we were just too tipsy?",4
"The Good:  The service was super attentive, the ambiance was really fine, the food was good, particularly the chunky guacamole in the Dip Duo and the steak my companion ordered.  The bar menu was interesting and the wine list was well chosen.  My companion's dessert, a homemade Oreo sandwich, looked amazing.\n\nThe Not So Good:  I have food intolerances, but I'd rather just order carefully than discuss them with strangers.  That means I rely on accurate menus, not ordering the entr\u00e9e that comes with ponzu, even though I love Ahi, and asking for no almonds on my Macho Salad.  It's really good and half as big as one I'd make for myself, which makes it a very large salad, but it was a chore removing the many croutons and getting all the corn out would have required more patience than I have.\n\nI'd probably eat here again quite happily, if it didn't require that conversation (\""So, I can't eat..., etc.), but it does, so I'd rather move on to one of the many other fine restaurant choices in Phoenix and Scottsdale.",2
"dear studio B, you da you da best, you da you da best, the best I ever had, best I ever had!",4
"I love this place!!!! Anything and everything you need, it's here. I bought Chia Seeds, 10lbs for $10, way cheaper than anywhere else. I bought a sarape table cloth for $15, normally those run $35 somewhere else. I could easily spend 3 hours here. They have great food and there is usually a band playing.",3
"Amazing! We love Cooper...it is our all time favorite restaurant! Every single time we come we have a wonderful experience... The atmosphere is inviting, the service suburb and the food consistently excellent! Once you have had Cooper... No other Indian food compares. The chicken tikka masala is heaven!!!",4
La Salsa in California is a take out fast food type place that at least has a self serve salsa bar with a few 'fresh' salsa choices. My friends and I ate at La Salsa Cantina on the strip and couldn't believe our quesadillas came with chips and sour cream...but no salsa. We asked for salsa and it appeared we had asked for shredded black truffles so we said we'll take an order of chips and salsa; that seemed to compute better and btw also costs $2.95. Problem solved? No! We finally got salsa and we all ate it at the same time and said the same thing....' It tastes like a jar of salsa from the supermarket'. Come on now! The name of the establishment has the word salsa in it!!!!,1
I really like this buffet. There's a wide variety of food choices. When you're at one end of the buffet you can not see the other end. That's how big it is. I eat lunch here and it was only $17. That's a pretty good deal for all the food they give you. I will come back here again and again. They never fail to please me. GO RIO!,3
I am extremely picky about my creme brulee.  I make my own and go all out when I do.  I'm talking buyin vanilla beans.  Fresh eggs.  The whole 9.  Torched Goodness is FANTASTIC.  I had the cappuccino on the recommendation of owner and couldn't have been happier.  What a welcome addition to the Phoenix food scene.,4
The decor has got to go..or at the very least wipe down all the dust..  I have to say the food was good not great but good.. The staff all seems to be in some other world though. So depressing all of them like they hate their jobs.. What a way to start my morning.. MANAGER if you are reading this I would say a cleaning day is in order.and something to boost the moral of your employees..as I saw you yourself acting the same way just depressed. All that feeds of to your customers.. I well give this place another chance and hopefully the experience will be different..,1
"OK I've found my nail salon in Vegas finally!  Diamond Nails does shellac manicures (one of the few who don't confuse shellac with gel). James did my shellac manicure and regular pedicure, and did a great job. Everyone in the salon is helpful and knowledgeable , asking if you want water, if you're comfortable, etc. I felt very comfortable as soon as I got there.  I will be back next time I need a manicure, pedicure or any of the many services they offer! Prices were pretty much average for what I had done, they took care of me right away, and I got great service by people who know what they're doing.  What more could I ask?\nGreat find!!!",4
"This is now my go-to restaurant for breakfast when staying within walking distance (and that includes the Tropicana, the MGM, and other hotels near them).  Two hot breakfasts to order, including one Lumberjack special, and the tab was $23.  Good service, no wait on a Saturday morning.",4
"Stopped into this nice, mid-sized Middle Eastern restaurant for lunch today, got situated in a comfortable booth, & ordered the \""Oven Roasted Lamb Platter\"" ($10.95).  It started with a cup of my choice of soups (Lentil), & then at the appropriate time the lamb arrived, served as tender chunks topping a neatly shaped pile of brown rice with tasty nut slices in it, several garnish items around the edge of the plate, a basket of flatbread, & a cup of sweet green mystery sauce which seemed to taste best with a piece of the lamb dipped into it & then both cuddled up into some bread.\n\nI liked the food here, & the portion sizes were good.  If you're not a lamb person, a number of other lunch combinations could be put together for about the same cost or less.\n\nI DO have a negative to throw out though.  The proprietor, Mr. Mirza, was my server, & he was a cold sort of a fellow, as if he disliked me from the moment I entered.  At least that's the way it came across, & staff friendliness at a restaurant DOES matter to me.  I guess I'm spoiled by the medium to very friendly service I encounter most everyplace I go to eat here in Arizona.  Anyhow, that will probably keep me from returning to Byblos here (unless I hear from Mr. Mirza), so for now I must hold Byblos here down to 3 Stars.",2
Worst JITB ever. Slow and rude employees.,0
"Cute decor and a tasty frosty beverage called the Frozen Hot Chocolate. \n\nIt pretty much tastes like a chocolate milk with ice and whipped cream and chocolate shavings.\n\nOn a hot day, I think it may make some people crumble to their knees. The wait? Well, we got lucky on a Monday and sat at the bar as soon as we walked in.... No complaints here. \n\nShare with a couple of friends and you won't feel so cheated. The decor was cute and worth a moment to roll through if you like cutesy places.",3
"I love this place!  The meat is sliced thin and with \""Mike's Way\"" it is just plain goodness.  The guys who work here are polite and really make you feel welcome.  Give it a try . . . you'll never return to Subway.  Thank you Jersey MIke!",4
delicious. so glad to find such a treasure.,3
"Oh, Carlos, why are you trying so hard to be hip?  From the shoes to the cheesy collaborations to this restaurant--it just screams middle age crisis.  And I love you.  I truly do.\n\nWhat I don't really enjoy is overpriced items based solely on name brand recognition as opposed to true quality.  Not that the quality was bad.  I actually enjoyed my duck quite a bit.  And I tried my mom's fajitas and they were nice.  And the appetizers (especially the queso) hit the spot.  (You did, however, fail miserably with the ceviche.)\n\nBut when the food is only \""good\"", I don't want to see ridiculous price tags.  I mean, fusion Mexican is still just a version of Mexican and an average of almost $20 per entree is just a bit ridiculous for just mediocre flavor combinations.  \n\nAnd the decor, while hip and trendy, is a bit garish after a while.  The band playing in the middle of the restaurant is also a bit obnoxious for those of us who came to actually eat a meal as opposed to going to a club atmosphere.\n\nKudos, however, to the incredibly competent staff who took care of our large group so well.  They really did a phenomenal job for my grandpa's surprise 80th birthday and everything was right on cue.  And though this wasn't a reflection upon the restaurant, I tip my hat to the cute group of girls out celebrating a bachelorette party who took the time to sing \""Happy Birthday\"" to my grandpa--seriously, it made his day!",2
"I think I am the first to review the breakfast here and I will say I was not impressed. I was really interested in trying this place,  I like the concept - fresh organic and classy. But they have a lot to work on before I would go back again. To start, the waitress had no knowledge of the menu and did not understand anything we ordered. There was no refill on water or coffee and the food was a total let down. The oatmeal came in a tiny bowl and my omelette was boring and uninspiring  - I could have made better at home.  Needless to say, we quickly paid the bill and made our way to La Gran Orange for a real breakfast experience.",1
"Having tried only two styles of meat tartare before experiencing Marche 27, I was very excited to discover new raw meat sensations. I approve this message. Overall, I can't get the bill out of my head.\n\nDon't get too excited by how the interior looks like: just a decent border between ghetto McGill and le Plateau. Bricks, chalkboards and a pseudo-atmopshere. Oh and an anecdote: the restaurant tries to put in a low lighted, cozy and almost romantic atmosphere at night but somehow needs to have a TV showing Habs getting their butt kicked. \n\nFood was good, no doubt about that. Most of the sauces match well with the served meats and the portions are generous. I recommend the duck tartare and the French fries. More, if the day of your visit allows you to, get some oysters. However, this not grande cuisine. The sauces are sometimes way too sweet and the oyster sauce almost felt like cheap vinegar. \n\nMoreover, I experienced quite a cheesy service with a waitress dressed as if she was going to 1234 and who tried to describe her food as a complex and conceptual experience. Big MTL, keep it simple.\n\nFinally comes the bill. Bleh: Old Montreal prices for simply good food and a decent atmosphere?",2
"My gel manicure turned out not-so-great. The people are nice and they helped us right away, but I'm really not happy with how my polish turned out.",1
"I don't know if I'd really go with \""Taste of Europe\"" for the name here, but then I haven't really traveled extensively in Europe, so I don't know that I wouldn't either. I have had Polish food, but the only thing I remember was Duck Blood Soup (kinda hard to get that out of your mind), and I wasn't interested in having it again.\n\nThe pierogis here are pretty much what you expect - mostly potato-filled pasta pockets - though if you've had them elsewhere (out of the freezer, or the one or two places around town that serve them in Charlotte), they are worth trying here, because they are better. Also, you can get them boiled or fried, and has been mentioned, boiled is more like steamed than you probably would think. Still, they are ultimately potato-filled pasta pockets, and thus, not terribly exciting.\n\nWhat was surprisingly tasty was the stuffed cabbage rolls (not sure if they were really rolls), but it's good, and goes down well - definitely worth a try, even if you don't like cabbage. The potato pancake was good too.\n\nAs a bonus, the staff is very friendly. Perhaps because they weren't busy, and I'm not sure if they are ever busy. Perhaps \""pierogi house\"" would have been a better name.",2
"This place would have recieved 5 stars, but my main gripe is the fact that bouncers are strict ass mofos. We get here a bit early waiting on friends to come, and they keep nagging on us, telling we cant wait here, like every 5 mins. The line for this place was so long it wrapped around the whole hotel. Roll with 15 girls and 2 guys and they didnt let us guys in lol funny. Be prepared to slip a bill if you want to get in front.\n\nAnyways on to the good news, when I finally got in after tipping the bouncer. Very nice venue, I was suprised it was kept pretty cool with AC and whatnot, even in the blazing heat of Nevada. Hit up blackjack with a friend and came up 4 bills what a great way to start off. Danced the night off and got drunk off my ass till we decided to hit up Rain at 2am. Overall this place is the most crackin night club hands down, but its a bitch to get in to.",2
"Henderson's is an institution in Edinburgh - a trail-blazing vegetarian-only restuarant before such things were de rigeur (and we're talking over 40 years ago).\n\n\n It's still a good place for vegetarians, and one of the few places to take vegan friends. But for my money it hasn't quite moved enough with the times: it still feels a bit basic and cafe-like (you collect a tray and go up to the counter), and the prices are a little high for what you get. But it is reliable, the ingredients are always fresh, and the array of salads is impressive. A better bet for lunch in my view.\n\n\n They've recently revamped the bistro next door, which offers a more upmarket dining experience with modern decor, though I have not eaten here. They are open on Sundays, albeit closing at 22h. What is it with veggie places and early closing?",2
"I went to 40 westt for valentines day, they have the lounge section which is romantic and nice to have a live band while you're  eating. Service was okay, never got a glass of water until at the end with my dessert, I had to ask for it. We got the tomahawk for 2, 40/50% of the meat was fat. The wine selection menu is confusing, there's over 500 bottles on the menu. Side dishes were perfect, but the waiter brought them 5 min after getting my steak. For the price I paid I should went to keg and I would of got more for my money. This time I was disappointed from 40 westt.",2
"For some reason I keep coming back for more and more. I've returned at least 3 times since originally yelping about PaM. That's probably because even after the few snafu's I've had here, the pizza is really good. Probably my favorite take-out pizza. The calzone issue was resolved; it was simply a misprint on their menu. 3 out of 5 for now, though very close to being a 4.",2
"Nothing beats Boiling Crab BUT I must say that this place has no waiting time and perfect for big parties. So, kudos for that. The shrimp is fairly large size. FRESH crawfish is definitely a MUST. We tried the frozen ones since they ran out of fresh ones and it didn't do justice. The cajun sauce medium was tough to handle.. Whenever we go here, it's always a hit or miss; always too hot. Also, the last time we went here, we got charged over $50 because of miscommunication with the servers. So, make sure that your tab is accurate or else, you will spend 30 minutes trying to figure it out with the main server. I think our server was new and granted that we had a big party, we were very patient with her.",2
Dr. Muyot is amazing my two children both see her. It's really nice to have a doctor that really cares. We have been patients of hers for 13 years I would highly recommend her to everyone. We go to the teneya office it's clean and the staff is always friendly. If you are looking for a doctor look no further she's a keeper.,4
Called and left a message with problem and phone number - heater in one of my Phoenix houses was not working.  Also called several times without leaving a message.  \nHe must have more business than he can handle because he was completely unresponsive.,0
"Good idea in theory, however it's a shame that its so poorly ran. Director is a liar and a cheat.  I would never send my children to this hole in the wall. I'd rather pay top dollar for private lessons with educated and professional musical instruction, rather than pay tuition to this place that is housed by nothing more than garage band rejects.",0
"Champagne brunch was a big disappointment.  Cost $39.95 with unlimited champagne or bloody marys.  $31.95 without alcohol.  Food was nothing special and the selection was limited.  Your better off at Cravings in the Mirage.  There were no crab legs, no Kobe steak and no turkey.  They did have prime rib.",1
"The best barber in this store is Angel, he works hard to ensure a great job on all levels!  My father was a barber thus I know and understand what professionals do and provide as far as services go.  Jeff's skills are lackluster at best-probably one of the worst haircuts ever.  I recommend this store but only for the reason that Angel works hard to provide a quality product each and every time.  Thanks to Jeff and his rude attitude I've taken my business elsewhere",1
"I went here twice, first time being the soft opening and second after a couple of months of it being open.  My boyfriend Mervin works at Pink Taco and the management team was able to go and try out the food.  I got the Lobster Spaghetti Special and it was delicious after I got it re fired.  I took it back because of the spaghetti noodles were too \""AL dente\"" for my taste.  Mervin got the Free Range Organic Chicken, and it was really good.  Their seafood soup is fabulous, as well as their strawberries almonds pastry and cappuccino. \n  The second time we went with our friends and we all ordered different dishes,  We got the rack of lamb with radicchio, beef medallions with mashed potato, a seafood pasta, and a porterhouse.  Everything was cooked to perfection with a great server that had a great sense of humor.  \n  It is average price for such an upscale restaurant it has nice decor and ambiance.  I highly recommend it for anyone who loves good Italian food.",3
"Initially stopped at a mall kiosk when I asked for a battery for my phone, the employee behind the counter chuckled then could not open the phone to see the battery. The frustrating part is that I phoned first and asked if they service phones - Next.\n\nWent to find an AT & T Store... Found the store and signed in and was eighth on the list. While waiting I noticed (overheard) that each customer was told \""you need a new phone.\""  My turn, I describe my issue and ask for a battery. \""You need a new phone,\"" I'm told. I reply, \""This is a work phone, I am on call tomorrow, I need a battery.\"" This continues for awhile and I find out if they have any batteries \""yes.\""  Then I talk the clerk into putting it in my phone. She obliges and puts it on a charger -  immediately says it's not charging. I finally persuade them to sell me a battery.",0
"There are very, very few perfect dining experiences.  This was one.  Immediately, you are transported to a country ch\u00e2teau in the Loire valley when you walk in this place.  And then...the courtyard.  Candlelit, perfectly rustic and overgrown with vines and palms, and adorned with candles and chandeliers.  You just...forget, and you are truly transported.  And then there's the service.  Absolutely on point.  Professional, never obsequious, and ridiculously prompt.  My husband and I both had the filet and the diver scallops.  I mean, beyond perfect, both.  I can't say enough about how fabulous our experience was.  Vingt s\u00fbr vingt.",4
"You people are crazy or just been hit with too many bombs to give less then 3 stars!\n\nPerfect location right off State Street. Best atmosphere. Peanuts shells all over with tons of writing on the wall.Spacious with huge booths. Even I (in my twenty) would fell comfortable coming here by myself getting a burger and Bloody Mary (anytime of day).\n \nThe bloody was even better then the one I had in Milwaukee. The amazing staff were a hoot trying to bomb our table but kept on missing. The cheese curds are extreme yumminess. Flavorful and perfectly salty. Nice and chewy with a light batter to let the curds from Ellsworth shine. The fries were crispy on the outside but soft inside and seasoned perfectly. No need to ketchup. The Mad Sconnie Burger \""uninspiring\"" I think not. Tell me where you can get a burger with Stella's Bakery spicy cheese bread (look at the bottom of you burger when you order there's crispy cheese there) that adds a little heat, then add Frickles yes Frickles that helps to balance it out. Then lettuce, tomato and bomber sauce. The patty is a blend of grass fed beef blended with Berkshire Bacon. Being that there is bacon in it causes it to look pink. So don't think it raw when they serve it to you. The owner Joe Sorge was even there that night. He greeted us at the door and made us feel very welcomed. Talking to us though out the meal. He told us about the pink patty which I would have returned to the kitchen otherwise. Which shows you that he truly cares about this restaurant in Madison to drive all the way from Milwaukee to see the customers and staff. He really is listening to his customers and fixing any issues. Which makes me want  to get a job working for him.\n\nA night of many great first.\n- Stella's Bakery spicy cheese bread\n- Frickles\n- Patty made with a blend of beef and bacon\n- Meet the owner in person not via twitter/facebook (yes that is really he that talks)\n\nFollow them twitter @ajbombers and @ajbombersmsn and Facebook to stay updated in food coma.",4
"This restaurant is very convenient and despite having found 2 other Thai restaurants that I really enjoy (Nicky's Thai and Smiling Banana Leaf) I thought I would give it a try. The portions are generous and the staff was very nice. Overall I felt that the food was okay, but fairly bland. We enjoy heat with our Thai food and typically order meals at a 7 or 8 out of 10, but despite the increased level the majority of the food appeared to be prepared at a much lower heat level. The highlight of the meal was the pumpkin curry, which did have a nice complex flavor and heat level. I was disappointed that although other Thai restaurants had the Green Papaya salad in season, this restaurant did not. Although it was not a bad meal, there are much better thai restaurants in Pittsburgh.",2
Je vous pr\u00e9viens tout de suite en ressortant de la distillerie vous appellerez direct votre grand m\u00e8re pour qu'elle vous mette de cot\u00e9 des bocaux. En effet le concept de ce Bar c'est de servir les cocktails dans des bocaux et pour les gourmand il y a des bocaux de grand taille et je pense que l'on n'est pas loin des 75cl !!! Vu que les cocktails sont pas mal charg\u00e9s et sucr\u00e9 ca monte vite.\n\nPour ce qui est du bar c'est sur que c'est pris d'assaut et que les places sont ch\u00e8re ! Bon avec de la chance une table se lib\u00e9r\u00e9 \u00e0 notre arriv\u00e9 donc on a saut\u00e9 dessus. Malgr\u00e9 le fait d'avoir une place vu la population a l'int\u00e9rieur on est souvent bouscul\u00e9. Cette population n'aide pas \u00e0 avoir un service rapide mais lorsque le serveur s'occupe de vous il passe le temps pour vous expliquer les diff\u00e9rents cocktails et vous conseiller en fonction de vos gouts. \n\nD'ailleurs \u00e0 l'entr\u00e9e vous avez tous les mois le magazine de la distillerie avec des informations sur l'alcool et la liste des cocktails et m\u00eame si les doses ne sont pas \u00e9crites je pense que je vais en tester \u00e0 la maison. \n\nPour moi c'est un bon lieu pour passer une bonne soir\u00e9e avec des potes et de l'alcool (mais pas pour discuter car la musique et forte et si comme nous la table de fille a cot\u00e9 hurle vous n'entendrez rien d'autre).,4
That Viet coffee though.,2
"I've been craving some quality pastrami for a few weeks now and decided after work to hungrily roll up to Sammy's excited to check what this tiny shack on Durango x Flamingo has to offer.. I ordered some pastrami garlic fries and the homie/coworker ordered the pastrami burger. After eating our meal me and my coworker were pondering whether to get something else to eat elsewhere after eating our food. We contemplate heading back to work to eat at employee dining even. Haha. Portions were mediocre by Las Vegas standards. Highlight was probably the Pomegranate slushie drink. It trys to serve diner food minus the diner experience and service but the food ranks slightly above the mainstream fast food chains that similarly serve the same type of food. But! At the very least, if you're gonna have pastrami in your name, your pastrami game better be tight and live up to the hype! Which alas, it doesn't. Sort of bland and flavorless. I'm kinda sad, I had high hopes for you Sammy's. I was expecting you to be something like the Hat's (out in Los Angeles) little brother. Ah well.",2
"This place was nice back in the day, but continues to decline as each day passes.  Charging $20 to get into a played out club is a bit much in my opinion when there are so many other bars/clubs that offer so much more within blocks of this place (some that are much nicer with a much lower cover).  This place is poor with service and the atmosphere is weak too.  Do yourself a favor if you want a bar with class and go anywhere but here.  This place has turned into something I never thought it would is all I can say.  The clientele has completely changed compared to a couple years ago, but I guess that's what happens when you have poor management.  People want to go where it is hip and this place is definitely not \""IT\"" anymore.  There are so many places close by that offer so much more.  Check them out and don't waste a dime in this dump.",0
"Bland fried rice. Overcooked Teriyaki Chicken. Soggy Eggrolls. NOTE, their Chicken \""CHOW MEIN\"" does not include noodles, even though the very definition of the dish is \""fried noodle\"". It's just a slop of chicken and onions.",0
"Loved the location and ambiance. Can't say the chef and I share the same taste for spices. Lots of Harissa and an un-identifiable spice on everything from the filet, the steak tartare and simple salad dressing that I didn't love. \n\nI had the scallops that may have been a tad over-done because they were pretty rubbery. \n\nSkipped dessert but had great service and a wonderful night overall.",2
"Delicious food, excellent service, nice atmosphere. And they finally taught me how to mix the middle eastern oregano and dip the pita bread in it. The falafel was excellent! The hummus was very tasty. The baklalva was the best I've had in Vegas yet, better than most places in NYC.We heard there is Belly Dancing on Friday, Saturday night...",3
"Definitely the place to go for Sunday brunch! However, late brunch-ers, beware! At 11AM, all the tables were full and there was a wait time of 45 minutes for a party of two. We ended up eating at the bar, which wasn't a big deal, and still relatively comfortable, but if you are brunching with a large party and would prefer a table, you definitely want to get there early!\n\nThe $10 bottomless mimosas at DLUX can NOT be beat. Bottomless mimosas are usually upwards of $20 at most places that I've been to/heard of, so $10 is a fantastic deal! Oh, and they are VERY liberal with the champagne! ;) (Believe me, I sat at the bar right next to where they were making the pitchers of mimosas.) You definitely don't want to plan for doing work right after a few rounds! \n\nUnfortunately, I wasn't a huge fan of the Ginger Salmon burger that I ordered (hence the three stars). In particular, I was a little weirded out that the salmon wasn't a fillet (which is how I've usually had salmon burgers in the past). Instead, the patty is made up of mashed salmon bits...which I found kind of strange. I did like the flavor of the burger, but I think it could have been a little heavier on the toppings and a little lighter on the buns.\n\nNext time, I think I will have to try one of the regular beef burgers instead!",2
"Best Tapas bar in Las Vegas and probably the best tapas bar I've ever been to in my life.\n\nAll I can say is \""Just Do It\"". Everything on this menu is good. Every dining experience I've had  at Firefly is been consistently and outstandingly great. I've been going to this place for the last 9 years. Make sure you make reservations. This place is constantly bombarded with crowds of parties coming in. \n\nThank god the owner is my friend otherwise I'd be waiting for a looong time to be seated. Besides the fact the owner is my friend. \n\nThis place is just f*cking great! Great food, great service, great music, great crowd, great sangria, But!! finding a parking spot in the plaza where the restaurant  is located sucks big thumbs down. haha \nCheers to firefly for their food!",4
"This place offers a Groupon, of which we purchased.  We drove all the way there, to find the door closed.  They are currently undergoing renovations.   Unprofessional in my opinion.  Why offer a groupon when you are currently closed.   It also says on Yelp they are open.      I drove away so frustrated.  Luckily we found this awesome place called \""Kitchen 56.\""   No regrets on this place, great apps and burgers.   DON'T GO TO ARCADIA TAVERN.",0
"If you have ever been to The Patterson House in Nashville, you will definitely be disappointed with this place. Drinks were way overpriced and tasted worse than drinks I have had at a college bar.",1
"We received information that Gina's Homemade was just right around the corner from our house so we decided to place an order to go. We ordered the lasagna and the Pop's pizza. My husband told me it's not a \""sit down\"" restaurant, more like a place to buy food, GOOD food to take home.\n\nI have to say that this is some of the best food we've had, especially in an area where everywhere you go it's all food chains. The lasagna is UNBELIEVABLE. You have to try it. We ordered the single serving lasagna and we wished we ordered more. I can't express how delish it was. The Pop's pizza was also so delish. \n\nIf you haven't tried this place, order food and take it home, you truly won't be disappointed.\n\nI plan on picking up more lasagna today!!!!!",4
"I hope to age as gracefully as the Old Waverley Hotel. Not that I want to live to be over 150 years old, but it's in remarkable shape, all things considered.\n\nBeyond having a rich history, I thoroughly enjoyed the creaky, tilted central stairs, the free high-speed wi-fi throughout the property, and especially the spectacular views from my room of Scott Monument and the Edinburgh Castle. \n\nThey do, however, need to reconsider the furniture configuration in the rooms: there's no room to fit a chair under the work desk because the bed is simply too close. In order to work, I ended up having to straddle the edge of the desk. That's -not- an attractive look, let me tell you.\n\nAlso, kudos to the exceptionally efficient staff at the front desk. They may be brusque, but they will get you checked in/out in record time!\n\nThat's kind of how this hotel goes: it may not be glitzy, glamorous, or the newest, shiniest hotshot on the block... but it'll get the job done. Like 'wham, bam, thank ya ma'am' done. And that, good readers, is a respectable thing indeed.",2
"My search for a good Mexican restaurant finally turns up some fruit--right here in DeFo.  My initial impression wasn't great, when we sat down at the (sticky) bar to order a margarita--all of which are pre-mixed.  But we were intrigued by the huge menu, which had a lot if really authentic looking choices.  The BF and I ordered the parillada Mexicana--a veritable sh!t-ton of food, with chicken, pork, beef, chorizo, and shrimp.  Guac, sour cream, pico de gallo, rice, beans, and tortillas come on the side.  With the exception of the shrimp, which were overcooked, the food was delicious.  And we had tons left over for lunch the next day.  The atmosphere is laid back and comfortable, and the staff are friendly.  I foresee many happy returns.",3
"Aimed squarely at the college crowd, which means good (not great) food and friendly ambiance at affordable prices.  There's nothing bad about the place but you can feel the invisible hand of cost control.  Best for coffee and desserts as others have said.  I'm still looking for the perfect breakfast place in the Waterloo / Kitchener area, which for me would consist of Eggs Benedict with real Hollandaise served with English Breakfast tea (fresh brewed, not from teabags).  Do I have to drive all the way to Toronto for this?",2
"This place was awesome! I called them 30 minutes before they closed to see if they had some items, they did and they had them ready for me when I arrived just before closing. It was In and out, and they were very helpful. A little pricey but I guess most vitamin supplements are. Definitely coming back!",3
"I have been shopping at this Fresh & Easy for months.  I love the place.  It is clean, cheap, and everything is fresh.  From the flowers, to the fruits, and to the vegetables.  The staff is always so friendly and helpful.  The location is so close it is nice.",4
"Where to start.... Service was slow, food was dull.\nCarnesada burrito had hardly any meat. Rice was blah and dry. Steak fajitas were actually pretty good, could of done with out so many onions and bell peppers.\nWe had to pay for the chips and salsa which was $2.99 but then u get unlimited after the first serving.\nGot a really great drink but that was $10 don't think that was worth it.\nOur total bill for two people not including tip was $53\nFOR MEXICAN FOOD that wasn't even great.\nThey get two stars, cool atmosphere and and tasty drink",1
"On second thought,  rialto's is pretty decent. This time around we got a specialty pie with 5 cheeses and tomatoes. The crust was good and so was the pie but the dough underneath the toppings doesn't hold up so well. Its very flimsy and difficult to eat so I used a fork and knife. \n\nTo sum it up...messy but tasty",2
"Not a bad place for happy hour.  The beers were pretty cheap, and the food wasn't bad at all.  There weren't many people here though.  They were all next door at Firefly's.  The place isn't big, but the service was really good.  Probably for the fact that there weren't many people in there.  Nice place for a happy hour menu though.",3
Literally the worst pizza I have ever had. The crust was hard and chewy and the toppings just slid right off and were pretty bland. Very disappointing.,0
"This was the best and spiciest curry I found in Edinburgh.\n\nIt was also had the single best restaurant decor I have EVER seen. The place is literally family-run and they're some of the most hospitable and friendly people in the world.\n\nI went on a curry tour of Edinburgh while I was on holiday. I've eaten curry on three continents now and, back home, I like to get my Indian take-away and add both habaneros and ghost pepper hot sauce to it before I eat it. Curry, and especially spicy curry, is very much an essential part of my life. So I picked a new Indian joint each night while I was in the city in an attempt to find it.\n\nThe Kismot Killer wasn't available at the time I showed up but I was advised by my waiter (one of the coolest, most welcoming guys I've ever met) it's so spicy that it takes away from the actual FLAVOR of the curry, anyway. Let's be honest, there's a point when spicy becomes less about flavor and enjoyment than pure ego.\n\nSo I got the next spiciest curry on the menu - Vegetable Naga - and asked for IT extra spicy, with rice and chapati. The food was EXCELLENT. The dish, even without modification, was ACTUALLY a fair amount spicy - which, if I can taste a bit of spice, most people probably shouldn't eat it - and the flavors were SO vivid and pleasant. I would've preferred it spicier by a bit but that's okay, it was still the spiciest curry I was able to find in the city and definitely my favourite. \n\nNext time I go to Edinburgh I shall be visiting again.",4
"4.5 stars!!!\n\nWhat this place lacks in decor and location it more than makes up for with great Vietnamese food and helpful service.\n\nI came the 3 miles from my hotel to satisfy my yearning for noodle soup (after reading about this spot on Yelp). Even though I arrived after it was closing they served me my Mi Tom Cua (squid, prawn, crabstick and egg noodle) without complaints. Also they let me order a take-out pork sandwich. All for $12. \n\nI loved the fragrant tea so much I bought a pound of it too. Even though I only wanted 1/2lb I didn't make a fuss as the family was so nice.\n\nCome here and try the beef pho (i don't eat much beef so I skipped it) as it looks like the best!",3
"I am simply writing this review to let you know to shop here ONLY if you want the shittiest service of your life.\n\nStaff here is BEYOND rude and have sticks up their ass.\n\nSure- you were probably hired because you're hot, but do your damn job and help the customers out instead of standing at the register and rolling your eyes at every customer who walks in.\n\nYou work at an American Apparel...... please get real.",1
"Craving a slab of juicy flavourful ribs I opted for 3 time world champion Memphis Champ BBQ. Unfortunately the meats were suprisingly dry, tough and often unexceptional. I sampled the wings(ok) the brisket (dry), ribs (reasonable) fried pickles(strange but good) , onion chips(very good)\n\nNice to get away from the maddening crowds, service was friendly and helpful, sadly food quality needs to be watched more closely.",1
"This place is the best for everything , food , customer service , and just too notch !! The staff is exceptional and they always make me feel welcome ! And are very personable which I love ! The ranch dressing is the best ever and the burgers and hot wings and chimichanga and also the calamari are all to die for !!! I love the iced tea as well ! Best ever ! This is my favorite spot to go period and I've tried a lot of places.",4
"The egg rolls are like no other.\n\nThe food I have had here several times is very good, all I need now is to find which days the nutty aunt isn't working so I can go enjoy the food.",3
"Well, the ambiance is wonderful but we were fooled the other night with another expensive place which had great looking sauces but was just bland even after the waiter said the sauce had a spice to it, it was bland. So we tried Michael Mina's StripSteak. My dining guest said Mina's name like I should know it, I think he has a restaurant in San Francisco too.\n\nFirst, the Rare Ahi, Nioise Garnish was just simple with simple seasoning that was perfect. I got the Prime Rib rare to check to see if they could do it right, because most place's rare prime rib is just not done slow enough and if not over done it is still just tough. I was very impress. And the Brussels sprouts we ordered was prepared all sliced up like cole slaw, we were both impressed. The lobster was cut in half long ways so it was no work at all to eat lobster. It was marked as market priced on the menu and we both bet to see who came close. I bet $50 and my friend said $60, it came to $74 but we both said it was seasoned well and was worth it, believe it  or not.\n\nSo, I'm going to have to find this other restaurant in San Francisco.",4
Took these people 5 hours to put 2 rear brake pads on my car. Could've shown my child how to do it faster. Only good part was family feud was on the TV the whole time. Never again,0
"A diamond in the rough! One of the most memorable, heavenly meals my husband and I ever had. The food was as good as any fine dining steak house in Vegas yet the prices are better. The steaks were aromatic and succulent! Our martinis were divine! Our waiter was attentive, charming, friendly and knowledgeable. We ate and drank ourselves silly. I want to go back to Vegas just to eat there again. Don't stay away just because it's in Circus Circus. I can't say enough good things about The Steakhouse.",4
Had a Amazon Local deal for this place which is close to my office.........so we thought we would try.  All the Sodas were flat.........food was disgusting..........my wife's salmon had 7-10 bones still in it.  I would never bother to go back and I would think this dump will close soon anyway...........oh and the bathroom had an overwhelming odor of sewage.\nAvoid,0
"I got the DD...was too much food for me. Should have just gotten the Betty Boop. The waffle was amazing and the best part of my meal. Sad to say but my chicken breast was really dry (one star lost). I didn't like it at all. Frys food store has more juicy and flavorful fried chicken. I would go back but only to have the waffle and maybe try some other items and hope for better service. I also didn't like how loud the music was. I couldn't hear the people in my party and we were shouting trying to talk to each other (second star lost). It did give me a headache. I also felt the metal chairs were uncomfortable so I stole a regular wood one from the table next over. Lastly, the service wasn't very great. Always trying to find someone to get a refill for us and when they did it would take 10+ minutes (3rd star lost).",1
"Every thanksgiving my family likes to come here because we can get the private banquet rooms for our large family. The problem is that the food is not that special. We always get great service and they are very accommodating just wish the food had more flavor.\nThe kung pao beef should have at least one chili pepper in it - none!\nThe half chicken, while very crispy, was desert dry.\nEven though this place has private rooms, I am going to have to suggest a better place for the food.",2
"D-Lish-us!!\nWith my friend, Beth we had:\nLamb chop\nSeared scallops\nCeviche (my favorite!)\nStuffed piqullo\nGambas\nCheese platter \nStuffed dates\nSpicy bomba\n\n\nNext time we're for sure getting the paella!!\n\nThe service is top-notch. Highly recommend!!",4
"Quick and easy place to eat, our waiter was very helpful. I had duck noodle soup. It was good, but it was a bit oily.",2
"This place is atrocious, there prices are higher than all their sister stores and don't include rice and beans in their combo's. While I was eating there the staff apparently thinks that no one knows Spanish and was swearing like there was no tomorrow....Including someone who appeared to be a Manager. I will never step foot in here again, rather going to the much better quality sister store in Peoria off of Union",0
"I stayed here for work, this was my first time staying at this hotel and if I come back il stay here again. The front desk staff was responsive to my needs about a delivery I had from FedEx. They called down to the warehouse and asked that it be brought pumas soon as it was delivered so i could begin to work. The buffet has lots of fresh fruit and my omelette was very good.  My room was big and it was quiet at night. There is a casino in the building along with a comedy club and several restaurants.",4
"Insane long wait to get in, 4 cashiers for 200 people when we got there, each person taking 2-3 minutes to pay to enter.  I supervised tickets at the stampede, it usually takes 10 sec per person, if the computers are out maybe 30 sec, this took 2-3 min per person.\n\nI'd fire the person in charge of the entrance gates, it's insanely slow to get in.   2 hour wait.  If the day was hot people would be passing out from heat strokes.  Bonus: we didn't get a map of the gardens...",1
"This review is based solely on the threading services by Patricia. You can't go wrong with her. I've been to other threading places that are painful and pretty judgey about my eyebrows telling me I overpluck and to just let my eyebrows grow naturally.  Dude, I have a scar on my eyebrow, it doesn't grow back!\n\nAnyhoo, Patricia is really gentle and is probably the nicest lady in Las Vegas. The prices are already awesome and she even gives you a facial massage afterwards! You can't beat that!",4
"If you are looking for top notch food- this is it. If you want atmosphere and a restaurant experience- not for you. All fresh ingredients and really outstanding flavors. Meatball Sandwich, cheese pizza, antipasto salad all very flavorful",3
"Went to Taylor's Cafe for a fear that the line at LGO and Over Easy would be too long.  I wish I would have waited in line.\n\nThe place was pretty empty so you would have thought our sever would have been a little more attentive. \n\nMy cousin ordered scrambled eggs with an english muffin and they came out how she had asked.\n\nI ordered the french toast which I was highly disppointed in.  First, it had raisins in it-which it didn't state on the menu.  Secondly, it was severely undercooked and runny in the middle.  I had to sit and stare at it's grossness (yeah I know that isn't a word) so long that by the time our waitress came to check on us I didn't want a new one so I ordered just an english muffin so I didn't have to leave starving.\n\nDisppointing and I don't think I'll return.",1
Stopped in for a pint.  Had some pizza (was OK) and hit another place.,2
"By far the worst place I have been. This restaurant wins my vote for worst overall! I understand that with the grand opening of a new restaurant comes some flaws but never will I cheat on chowon again! It isn't a fancy restaurant but McDonald's has better service then this place! First off, we (group of four) arrived at the restaurant at 7:45, the rude waiter sat us down at a dirty table..okay we let that slide. Second he served us water in half empty cups! Waiter refused to ask us if we wanted anything else to drink. He took our order which consist of steamed dumplings, two jampongs, one kimchee soup, and curry seafood. The rude waiter never came back to refill our water..never came back to our table period. We sat there patiently an hour passes by no refill on water, no service, no appetizer. I mean steamed dumplings are steamed...how hard could it be to steam dumplings??! Atleast with an appetizer we wouldn't be so aggravated with the no service/bad service. An hour and thirty minutes passes and i had to walk up to the front of the restaurant considering no service in the dining room and he replys ten minutes..we wait ten minutes maybe even twenty and no appetizers/food. We walked out and all he had to say was okay? I will not be giving it the benefit of the doubt and to top it off they don't deserve my one star, so I take that back. I will never cheat on chowon again!",0
"So after that tragedy of a burger I had earlier from Carl's Jr., I felt a redemption could be made if I just ordered two cheeseburgers at BK.  How hard can it be to make two plain cheeseburgers?  So I waited, and waited, and waited, while other people were getting their chicken nuggets, Whopper Jr's, and Extra Long BBQ Cheeseburgers.  While all that was happening I was staring at their order board and saw my order was in red letters and was passing 5 minutes while all the others were in green letters and most were finished in under a minute.  For two plain cheeseburgers?  C'mon, now!!  Well I finally got my cheeseburgers and they definitely made up for that hot mess I had earlier from Carl's Jr.",2
Had halibut. Was well overpriced and over cooked and chewy. Won't go back. Paid over 60$ for mediocre quality.,0
"It used to be great, but they've been skimping on portions and the quality of rice they use is subpar at best.   Hopefully they will change that because this was our spot to eat whenever we go to Vegas.",1
"Oh man. I should've gotten the all you can eat but instead I chose the lobster and chips. \n\nIt was kinda sad when I got the meal because there was barely anything. But what can I say? It IS lobster.  The lobster kind of had an overlooked feel to it because it felt a little rubbery. All in all, it wasn't too bad but I wouldn't get it again. \n\nThe person taking my order was awesome, nice, and welcoming. \n\nThis was definitely a nice experience on my trip.",2
"Why all the bad reviews? I went to 3 clubs in 2 nights and thought this one was the best. Lots of fun, really great music. Expensive drinks and a really great time. I will be back here.",4
"It was the Cupcakery ($3 ea) or Project Cupcake ($2.65 ea). Spend the extra .35 and go with the Cupcakery. At the Cupcakery you'll get a fluffy cake, butter in the frosting and a beautiful box. \n\nThe cupcakes were beautiful in Project Cupcakes display case and the cupcakes you receive are exactly like the display case. Sadly, they tasted cheap. If they charged the extra .35 the cupcakes would taste be better. \n\nI read on here something about shortening in the frosting and that was an immediate turnoff, but we ordered 1 dozen anyway. How bad could that 1 ingredient be? Long story short, it ruined the whole products taste. The cake portion was short and dense as if the batter was beaten too much, the ones I tried had the texture of a muffin and tasted similar to cornbread. The frosting when room temperature had an airy consistency, they all smelled the same, like plastic (yes I smelled the frosting, you would too) and coated the mouth after a bite or two like a cheap chocolate bar.\n\nThe cupcakes came in a plastic frame, which to its credit, held the cupcakes in place nicely. These cupcakes are truly a project for someone, unfortunately I won't be their guinea pig.\n\nAlso we had the one with the chocolate chip cookie on top, but a friend just wanted the cookie.",1
"Great caffeine stop.\n\nNice location right by the lake and within walking distance to the botanical gardens and the lakefront park. They really ran with the whole cat theme in the ambiance, they place is covered with fun cat things in all sorts of ways. \n\nThe baristas were very nice and helpful. They were using Just Coffee which was cool. They weren't exactly gourmet espresso trained, but the americano I got can out well and the gelato was defiantly great. They have some great options to mix the two in affogstos and gelato-espresso shakes, yum! \n\nOverall not bad coffee for a reasonable price, I would suggest getting the brewed stuff with some gelato and enjoy it on a walk through the park.",3
Went to eat there this afternoon service was great food was good but I was in absolute shock by the way one of the managers was scolding the employees in the middle of the dining room..... I will not be back!,0
I've eaten here several times on visits to Madison and always enjoyed it despite comments of one reviewer.  Menu seems a bit more extensive than that of Afghan restaurant in Chicago and it is centrally located on State Street.  Like the soup too.,3
"I've heard a lot about this place, but honestly, it was a disappointment.  I went in at 2:50, right before the cut-off for lunch, paid the lunch price and ate the dinner.  I asked the cashier what's the main difference between lunch and dinner and she said essentially the seafood.  For dinner they have crab legs and cocktail shrimp.  They also switched in some lamb, baby veel and roast beef.  Everything else remained relatively the same.\n\nThe good: smoked salon, pulled-pork on corn bread, freshly made crepes (but not very good), good selection of desserts, korean bbq glazed kobe beef are among the few that i enjoyed. \nThe bad: laking in the sushi department for sure.  Nothing like unagi (eel), sashimi (raw fish), hand rolls or anything like that.  It was also a lot smaller than some other ones, so obviously the variety is a lot smaller.  There was only one main cutting station for meat, and one on the side that served a fish dish).  \n\nOverall, spending $27 for the meal and getting lunch and dinner may be worth it, but spending $40 for dinner, NOT WORTH IT.  If you're looking for a dinner place, just keep moving until the Wynn is our of your sight!",2
"Totally offensive, and unnecessary names for their sushi rolls.  They should add numbers for those who wish to eat a meal without referencing sexual acts.  We had three different waitresses by the end of our meal.  We specified ABSOLUTELY NO MAYO to the first waitress, but unfortunately that information was not passed along to the others.  Needless to say, we had to keep refusing rolls.  If not for enjoying being with my husband, this meal would have been a total loss!!!!!!",0
"Freundlich, lecker, griechisch\n\n\n Empfehlung? Eindeutig!",4

"Gorgeous face painting designs, always a line of happy kids! She does amazing work!",4
"Ok people lets stop being sheep here. Delux is nothing but an extremely overpriced low quality burger place. People are stuffed in here like cattle. The fact that so many people rave about Delux is just another thing I dont understand. I tried this place twice, (I will always try a place twice in case they have an off day) and I was very very disappointed both times. The burger I ordered was $11. ELEVEN DOLLARS FOLKS!!!!! No burger no matter how incredible is worth anywhere near $11. And of course this did not come with frys or anything else. The burger was kinda mushy with no flavor at all. The bun was very plane and did not have the best texture. I also ordered the sweet potato frys and did not like them at all. That was the first time I had ever had those so it could be I just dont like that type of french fry. The second time I ordered the regular frys and they were pretty undercooked with no seasoning. \n    This place proves my theory, if you make it snooty enough everyone will think its good matter how bad the food is. Delux is nothing but hype. If you want to try a real burger with great flavor and a descent price try Lenny's on Thunderbird and 35th ave. That's what a burger should taste like.",0
"This motel was cheap, so we didn't expect a resort...but what we got was nothing short of sketchy. We stayed 4th of July weekend, so the place was booked to capacity. The bottom line is that I would never pay over $30.00 a night for this place and even then...well I just wouldn't stay again. \n\n I'm just going to give a list of pros and cons to make this quick or I might be here all night. Here goes; the good, the bad, and the ugly. \n\nThe Good: \nNice showerhead, decent pressure, endless hot water. \nGreat AC unit\nFast check-in\nGreat parking. \nThe restaurant next door is called Coco's and they are AMAZING and are getting a wonderful review after I have a chance to rest. \nPool was decent with nice furniture and towels available. They also kept it open all the time unless people got out of hand (which didn't happen during our visit.) \nSecurity guard was a really nice guy. \nWalking distance to strip, us middle-aged, out-of-shape moms even managed it in the severe heat. It took us about 10 minutes to get from the motel to the Excalibur. \n\nThe Bad:\nKey cards were touchy, not good in 110 degree heat. \nDoor facing afternoon sun way too hot to touch, swollen shut, required kicking (as per maintenance) to open. Huge fire safety issue in my opinion, also annoying. \nCarpet really old, bunched up, dirty, and worn. Just walking from the shower to the bed resulted in dirty feet. \nWiFi was very spotty and slow, however it was this way all over town. 3G/4G was terrible as well, so this was likely a result of just too many people using all of it and probably not the fault of the hotel. \nBedside lamps broken\nBathroom door latch broken\nSeriously bad paint job\nVery loud, luckily the AC noise masked most of it. Helicopters every 5 minutes 14 hours a day. \nLots of \""unsavory\"" characters milling about, even two different creepy guys who kept watching our 12 year old daughters swim! \nWhile the sheets and pillow cases appeared clean, the blanket in between the sheets was gross. \nWhen we asked for an extra pillow, we were told they had \""run out.\"" They also never gave us the second luggage rack we had requested in order to keep our stuff off their gross floor. \nThe toilet seat was \""public style\"" with no lid, VERY annoying when the bathroom is the size of a postage stamp. Hard not to drop things inside. \nExpired pizza advertisements with expired coupon codes. \nThe room was VERY small. Not too bad for two people, but not good for 4 at all. \nScrewed up driveway entrance. Do yourself a favor and if there is a car there, go in the next driveway and then cut over. Better yet, find a better motel. \nOnly two electrical outlets in the whole room. \n\nThe UGLY:\nROACHES. Seriously. 2 inch long roaches IN OUR ROOM! \nRodent seen entering large vent across from pool entrance.\n(The above would not be nearly so bad if we had seen ANY evidence of ongoing pest control. The woman at the desk was actually kinda rude about it...like we were prudes for expecting our room to be free of pests.) \nA woman in our group was propositioned for sex, as if she were a prostitute working out of this hotel. It was 6:30am! \nIce machine broken, apparently only one for this huge hotel? Front desk advised us to \""just go buy some\"" at the SEVERELY overpriced liquor store next door. \n\nI guess it could have been worse...I mean, they could have had hourly rates posted. \n\nI may actually have more, but I'm not sure where my daughter put the list.",1

"Let's start with noting that this was the setting for mine and Catherine's first date together, as well as our engagement party with friends, and several fun but casual experiences dining out over the years.  We once raved about this place and went often.\n\nThen, when the manager refused to work with me on hosting a large family party there, I tried to boycott My Florist for a while.  Friends did the same.  But we couldn't stay away form the reliably good sandwiches on tasty bread,  half-priced wine bottles, and wonderful desserts.\n\nBut sadly, the last couple of times we went to My Florist, the food was so-so, service was mediocre, and our favorite pianist is no longer there!  I think the real reason for my two-star review is the fact that the pianist is gone.  It made me realize that all the greatest decorations cannot make up for a declining overall experience.\n\nPerhaps I'll revisit this later, but for now it gets two stars.",1
"Spare yourself. There are so many places to eat in this area and Village Inn should not be on your list.\n\nOrdered a to-go breakfast (first mistake) and the waitress who took the order apparently wasn't used to questions. \""Can you replace pork with turkey?\"" \""Ummmm I don't know.\"" Uh, what?\n\nI ordered the steak (medium) and eggs and my order was a pile of blob, with well done steak, which couldn't be torn apart because it was made of rubber. BFF orders french toast... turns out to be bread with generic strawberry jam. \n\nIt was so bad, we returned the order and went somewhere else. Don't lower your breakfast standards!",0
"Fantastic experience here. Very friendly waiter. No MSG in their food, which is huge to me. It does not need it, anyway. We had the green curry and it was great. Also ordered the Herbal Salad, which was recommended here by several yelp'ers. It was very lemongrass-y, which was good for a few bites, but I could not eat a whole plate of it. My husband had no problem eating a good deal of it, though. The coconut milk curry was great. We also ordered the mango with sticky rice dessert, as well as the fried banana with homemade coconut ice cream. The ice cream is to die for. best I've had in a while-- and homemade! :)  Mango sticky rice was wonderful, too, and I haven';t found many places that make it with coconut milk only instead of sweetened condensed milk. So happy to find a vegan version!",4
"Had coffee and the Breakfast Scramble. Their description: \""A croissant topped with scrambled eggs with spinach, ham and melted cheese, then topped with hollandaise and served with fresh fruit.\"" The croissant wasn't toasted and the eggs were a little runny (which I don't like in scrambled eggs), but it was otherwise pretty tasty. The \""fresh fruit\"" was just three cubes of watermelon, honeydew and cantaloupe. I hate melons so I couldn't eat any of that - and the description should read \""fresh melon\"" and not the much broader term \""fruit\"". The home fries - cubes of pan grilled potatoes - also tasted like they had been sitting under a lamp for a bit before I got to them. The coffee was pretty good for a diner and they had different flavoured creamers which is always a bonus since I hate regular ol' half-n-half. However, the waitress was a little slow on refilling the carafe as well as bringing the requested water (which was definitely tap). It was not busy at all.\n$27 pre-tip for basic coffee and two breakfast plates. Yikes.\nOver all, this is basically a Denny's trying to be trendy. I've had better food (and service) at iHop.",1
"I asked for an Americano with a small amount of dark chocolate -- shaved, pump, powder, I don't care -- whatever is easiest for you, although I was hoping they would pride themselves on having high quality, very dark, freshly shaved chocolate.  I was told they won't make it.  Not \""can't\"" because they don't have chocolate, but \""won't\"" because they know better than I what I should be drinking.\n\nAnd this from people who put honey in coffee.\n\nI will not be back.",0
"I love this place. The food is amazing, the atmosphere is homey, and I love looking at all the old musical instruments on the walls while I eat. \n\nI particularly recommend the West of the Andes or the Carne Asada plate.",4
"This place is in the same plaza as BJ's, and it is fairly easy to find if you use the turning lane in the middle of the block. I arrived here with some friends on Friday afternoon shortly after lunch hour. It wasn't too crowded, and they got put tables together to accommodate us sufficiently. We went straight for the buffet without even thinking about the menu, although it's pretty easy to justify eating the lunch buffet here when you do look at the entree prices.\n\nThe buffet table nearest to the clean plates is clearly all vegetarian items, and the next table has meat dishes, a small salad bar, and desserts. All the items are clearly labeled by name and with ingredients. While I don't remember all the names offhand, I loved the Chicken Korma, really enjoyed the vegetable samosas and Chicken Tikka Masala, also liked the Tandoori Chicken and Saag (spinach), and generally had no issue with other dishes except for the goat curry. That thing does not taste like goat, or like any particular meat. Also, your choice of butter or garlic naan is brought out from the kitchen to your table.\n\nAlthough I've only been to two lunch buffets at Indian restaurants, I feel that there's enough good food here to grant this place five stars, with of course some consideration that buffet food is generally not on par with a la carte courses. Check it out whether you like Indian food or whether you just want a change of pace.",4
"Its good being a girl and knowing people in VEGAS!\nmy cuz was a resident DJ he hooked up this place for me.\nIt was my friend's bday and I met them up here.

"I really want to like this place, but the food unfortunately was only ok. The staff and owner were VERY nice, I would come back to try again. I love me a breakfast burrito, but this one was just ok. I don't know what it was missing, but it just left me wanting a little more. The salsa they brought with it was good, but I don't know, something was missing. The bacon looked like ham, but it was bacon, maybe there wasn't enough bacon. Hash browns in side were good. Good amount of cheese too. \n\nFriend ordered fries too, which were good. I tried a friend's biscuits and gravy and honestly wasn't impressed. It wasn't bad, but it wasn't good. I really want to like this place, and it has such good reviews, but I wasn't blown away. I'm sorry Mr. Mama's but I'll try again. Especially for the price. I think my big burrito was only like $6.25 or somewhere around there. Makes my heart and wallet happy :)",2
Good Margaritas and nice staff they always make me feel right at home. My favorite plates to order here are the Street Tacos and the Chicken Spinach Enchiladas.,2
"Over priced mediocre food, the atmosphere is novel with animatronic forest animals but blaring rainstorm and animal calls every 20 minutes scared more children than it enchanted. Fail",0
"Our waitress was great and suggested multiple dishes and options that I'll be trying real soon. \n\nFor starters, the shattered potatoes are better than any fries I've ever had. Dipped in that jalape\u00f1o sauce, so good.\n\nAlso you can add a fried egg to any burger, and they offer fresh English muffins as an alternative bun, she suggested going this route with the standard cheeseburger.\n\nThe Crispy Chicken Sandwich came very highly recommended, a staff favorite. It had a golden brown crust and it looked friggin amazing. \n\nLots of people were ordering the kale salad, and it looked, well, it looked like a kale salad to be honest. Probably pretty bomb considering the frequency it was being ordered though.\n\nThe tuna sandwich was going out as much as the salads were, which I found a bit odd, but she said their Egg Salad Sandwich is one of the best sandwiches in the valley, and it's only sold for one hour a day...hot damn.\n\nI had the Paris, Texas Burger. It was...wow...\n\nThe beef was unbelievably savory, cooked medium rare with incredible mouthfeel, juicy but not at all greasy. Pancetta was salty and perfectly crispy, bacon's better brother. Sharp cheddar cheese blanketed the beef, holding it all together and melding the flavors into umami heaven. The apple butter BBQ sauce is otherworldly, sweet but with this slight smoky flavor that just rounds it all out. The dill pickles chips gave a fresh & light crispness to each bite, and the fresh poppyseed buns were baked to perfection culminating in this amazing amalgamation of tastes and textures. A new flavor took center stage with each chew, and I must have made the family that sat next to us really uncomfortable with all the moaning and grunting I was making as I ate. \n\nThe waitress also gave us a little dish of their lacto-fermented jalape\u00f1o hot sauce and it took the flavors to another level.\n\nSpicy-sweet-salty-savory-juicy-crisp-chewy-melty-glory.",4
"Ahh late night pizza wandering in Scottsdale. This was my first try at Joe's since they charge nearly double ($3.50) for a slice than good ole Gus on the opposite corner. The pizza also never looked that great, but after a drinky 4th, I rolled in for an all american pizza meal. I would clearly give the nod to the four buck Sicilian slice I nabbed - a corner slice. The crust was pretty NY thick style for this type and it reheated well. The regular slice was a pepperoni and mushroom deal that actually was easily foldable and had a bit of grease, but no oregano. Overall, after a few drinks, now there will be some competition for my pizza money, but probably go with regular slices at the other corner.",2
"The food is good, Kimie (bartender) was great and the location is awesome. You can sit at the bar and look out on the strip and people watch while you enjoy your delicious drinks.",3
"If you need your car serviced do yourself a favor and go somewhere else. Manager was of no help to make up the mistake his advisor had done, skip this place and go to scottsdale.",0
"Halfway through our dinner, we looked at each other and said, \""Really? This? In Madison, Wisconsin?!\""\n\nOh yes.\n\nWe began by sharing the carpaccio;  served with a shaved radish and pea shoot salad, smoked potato chips, and marrow vinaigrette, it was divine.\n\nWe then received a sample from the kitchen:  cold strawberry soup, seasoned simply with pepper, tarragon, and Moscato, garnished with a creamy blue cheese and a few lavender flowers.  Beautiful, and a delicious palate cleanser.\n\nFor an entree, I chose the whole roasted branzino.  It was exactly how I like my fish:  perfectly done, simply prepared, and seasoned with a light hand, so you can actually taste the fish.  The accompanying dill new potatoes were fresh, lightly buttery and delicious.\n\nMy boyfriend chose the hot paprika crusted halibut, which was really just superb.  The fish - pan-seared, crusted, then finished to perfection in the oven - was presented on a small pile of shredded smoked ribs, all of this nestled on a chickpea puree and drizzled with a demi glaze.  The flavors harmonized perfectly, and the presentation was beautiful.\n\nI'm not exactly sure how either one of us had room for dessert, but I'm glad that we did.  I ordered a goat-cheese creme brulee, accompanied by chocolate biscotti, a candied olive madeleine, and raspberries - so good.  My boyfriend chose the cheese platter, which paired three phenomenal local cheeses with sliced apples, quince jelly, and addictive smoked-candied Brazil nuts.  When we told our server that the nuts were, basically, crazy-good, she brought us a box of them to take home.\n\nOur check arrived with a little dish of sweets from the kitchen:  decadent chocolate mint truffles, strawberry jellies, and a handful of caramel corn.\n\nAll in all, it was a wonderful dining experience.  The food was of a caliber that we sometimes don't even see in New York City, and therefore weren't expecting to find in comparatively-little Madison.  The service was impeccable:  attentive but not overbearing, informative when we needed it to be.  The attention to detail was excellent from start to finish.  The wine list was nothing short of fantastic.  The room itself is beautiful, modern yet still romantic.   Yes, this restaurant is a splurge, but it's worth every penny.\n\nI will make one recommendation:  if you can, dine early.  Our reservation for 8:45 on a Friday night ultimately got us seated around 9:15, and the bar was so incredibly busy (the bartender was awesome, but he had no assistance) that we didn't get a drink until mere moments before we were seated.  Fortunately, the rest of the dining experience was so good that it made up for that slight glitch.",4
"I was really excited about trying this place. The website and menu look great. \nWhen my daughter and I entered the restaurant, we couldn't believe all the 60s decor. The menu really has a wide variety. \nWith games on the table and music in the background, I was ready for a great meal. \nNow the problems begin. Cleanliness must not have been a priority in the 60s, especially for this place. The tables and floor was filthy. \nI ordered a patty melt and onion rings. The patty melt had a decent flavor. The meat was good but VERY greasy. When I picked up my burger, most of the chopped onions fell out. I ate the entire burger with the assistance of a fork. The onion rings were terrible. Dripping with grease, no flavor, and over cooked, I only ate two. \nMy daughter was disappointed in her chili burger. When we told the waitress of our concerns, she brought us the bill. \nI give most restaurants two or three chances. Not this one.",1
"Had the salad special, the duck and the souther julip.  Bartender was really good.  They do not have draft beer, but they do offer craft beer in bottles and cans.\n\nThe salad special was really tasty; all ingredients were super fresh and complemented each other very well.\n\nThe duck was good, but the portion/slices were too big/thick for my tastes after having the salad and bread, but that's probably more specific to me than others.  My compatriots had the scallops which looked amazing.\n\nService was fine.  I kind of wish I had ordered the chicken instead, as I've heard amazing things about it, but I couldn't see how that baby would fit with everything else I'd consumed that day.  It looked GOOD from what I saw at other people's table's though!",3
"I waste 2hours.... The lady put my phone number wrong so i wait more than 2 hours.\nWhen i asked my wait hour at information desk again the guy said \""i do NOT have your phone number so you have to wait another 2hours.\"" Thanks a lot!!  :(",0
"The best thing about this place is that it's 24 hours. Cost about $9 for a small bowl, a dollar and some change more than what's around. Which wouldn't be a problem if it tasted better. Mediocre pho to say the least. Not the worst I've had though. It's just eh.",2
I can't believe alloif these good reviews. Have u guys never had Shave Ice before?    This was horrible. There was 6 of us total. All different flavors. They put lots of syrup on it but their syrup is too watered down. I couldn't taste anything but ice. I am glad I paid extra for the vanilla ice cream in the bottom or it would of been a complete waste. The ice is shaved nicely but no flavor.  I mean nothing. Also they are real slow.,1
"I think this airport is not my favorite at all.  I think it is because the service is not really good.  You pretty much have to take a shuttle for a rent a car which is not close which is 10 minutes away for the shuttle in boonie land. So make sure you arrive early.  Hmm the people that work there are rude and the luggage on the chart really is slow. Took them 30 minutes to actually get the lugguage out there and onto the carosel.  Also, the security is slow. I remember they had only one openng and it went by really slow.  Then 50 minutes later when the line was jammed back, they opened up another line, but when I got there it was alreay too late. I never ate the food there, but anyways not my favorite to go to.",1
"I want to love Viva Chicken.  I really do.  I LOVE peruvian food and live just two minutes down the road.  I have now been three times, and it has slipped each time.  \n\nEvery visit I have shared the chicken and the classic saltados (stir fried beef, tomatoes, onions, and french fries in a vinegary soy sauce.)  My first experience was a solid 4 stars.   The chicken was juicy and flavorful and the saltados were on point.   I should mention that saltados would likely be my desert island food choice.  I love almost every version.  \nOn visit two, the chicken was ok.  Not as flavorful as I remembered, but still good.  The saltados however were kind of dismal.  Dry, tough beef and completely disintegrated fries.  It was almost like it had been sitting for a while, even thought I know that wasn't the case.   I left just a little unsatisfied.  \n\nRound three was just kind of sad.  I was determined to relive my fist experience, so I returned again.   The chicken skin was cold and flabby.  The saltados had a weird, charred quality to them with no decernable sauce.   Even the dulce de leche cookies for dessert were bad; sandy and stale this time.  \n\nThe service however is impeccable.  They really try to provide a great experience.  If only the kitchen had the same consistency.",1
"Some friends and I recently spotted a deal on Expedia and decided to book a Scottsdale getaway at the Phoenician.\n\nThe grounds of the Phoenician are meticulously kept, and the staff is extremely warm and friendly.  The hotel layout is quite strange though, with many different wings to it and very odd placement of exits to the grounds, none of which are labeled.\n\nWhile the decor is somewhat dated, overall the interior of the hotel is very well maintained and clean.  There are several shops and restaurants on the property, all operating on the premise that you never have to leave (and therefore spend all your money here)!  \n\nMake no mistake,  this place will wipe you out if you let it.  A game of tennis cost us $50, not to mention the $20 pair of socks (I KNEW I forgot to pack something!).  A round of golf w/ rentals ran us $150 a person;  However, the desert course was beautiful and they do a fabulous job maintaining it, which ain't cheap.\n\nOn to restaurants.  Most of the spots had pretty good food.  All were incredibly overpriced.  The one exception was the poolside restaurant - In addition to being overpriced, the food there was disgusting!\n\nWith Old Town only 5 min away, I would suggest taking a car into town for dinner and checking out some of the fabulous restaurants there.  A towncar/cab ride should be $10-13 each way, so beware of un-metered cabs that will try to rip you off.  $15 max!!\n\nAll in all, the Phoenician is a very well-run resort with some great amenities and impressive golf courses.  However, if you are like me and your enjoyment is hampered by paranoia of being constantly ripped off, then you may not find it so relaxing.",2
"United is officially the WORST airline ever and I have vowed to never fly them so long as I live. Never. Ever. Their ticket counter people? Horrible.\n\nThe last time I flew United was with my husband (then fiance). We were going to India. For our wedding. In several days. The ticket counter woman wouldn't let him on the airplane because she said he didn't have a proper visa for flying through Frankfurt. He didn't need one. He told her, and proceeded to pull out a letter from the German Consulate in LA which stated \""You don't need a visa to fly through here to India.\""\nShe replied: \""I don't care WHO you got a letter from, I'm not lettin' you on the plane!\""\n\nTwenty minutes later, we convinced her to let him fly to Chicago, our layover, where he would recheck-in for our connection on Lufthansa. She yelled \""They'll just tell you what I\""m telling you!\""\n\nThey didn't. She was wrong. But thanks to her antics, he got a seat assignment far away from me and we had to sit separately on the 10 hour flight. \n\nWhen I wrote to United to complain (informing them that if she had succeeded in not letting him on the plane we would have MISSED OUR WEDDING) I never heard back from them. Ever. Nothing. No email, not apology, nothing. Which is why I am never flying their shitty planes ever again.",0
Customer service hahaha ... What customer service.  They are very very rude like they are doing you a favor. Unknowledgeable is the word for that staff. Never again will I or anyone I know go to nationwide vision again !!!! Worst time ever and arguing with customers in front of other customers as well. Do you guys just hire anyone off the streets ??!! DO NOT I REPEAT DO NOT GO TO THIS COMPANY !!! A fair warning has been issued to all.,0
"This is my favorite place to gamble on the strip.\n\nI am a budget Vegas-ite and enjoy being around folk who are not trying to impress me with their overpriced clothing.  For me, Bill's is an island oasis in center strip.\n\nCasual gambling that has $5 and $10 tables aplenty, plenty of servers who are liberal with their rounds, relaxed dealers, and a casual atmosphere.\n\nWELCOME TO WILD BILL'S WILD CASINO AND SALOOOOON!",4
"I planned  a bachelorette party (group of 5) and came here for Saturday champagne brunch - what a fantastic experience!  It was really a highlight of the day, and we had a lot of fun stuff that day.\n\nDefinitely make a reservation (like everywhere in Vegas, it seems).  The wait was long, but since I'd booked on opentable, we were seated immediately.\n\nFirst, the service.  Our server (Carmie I believe) had a ton of tables, yet she checked on us frequently and never left us with empty champagne classes.  She was so sweet.  We did unlimited small plates, and she started us off with some of her favorite/the most popular dishes and then let us order anything we wanted.  Even though she was obviously super busy, she had a huge happy smile all the time, and managed to chat with us for a moment each time she stopped by.  I don't know how people like her do it.\n\nSecond, the food. It was outrageously good. I can't believe I've never had breakfast small plates before - you don't have to choose! The shrimp and grits, short rib hash, and frittata were favorites with us.  We ate like kings for a super reasonable price, in a cute location.  We were STUFFED - brunch was at noon, and none of us was hungry for dinner at 7pm.\n\nBy VEGAS standards, this place is $$ I think; by yelp's listed standard, it's $$$.  Unlimited small plates cost I think $33 per person and unlimited mimosas on top of that was $8 or $9.\n\nHighly recommend this place.",4
"I think the food was great.   I did not like the wait and noticed that empty tables were left empty for a considerable time.   The Huevos Rancheros were okay.   I am not sold on the diced chicken.   I thought the tortillas should be fried a bit too.   The pancakes were okay.  Nothing incredible.   Maybe I was expecting more because of all the reviews but I found it to be just okay.   HOWEVER, if you like Hawaiian breakfasts, then this may be your place to go.  Loco Moco was very good.",2
"I had the worst experience checking into a hotel. I arrived to check-in around 11pm after a night of hanging out around Vegas. I had booked a double queen bedroom hotel room and got my keys to a room all the way on the other end of the casino. So far I would've rated the place a 3 or 4 stars because it is a bit old for a casino hotel on the Strip, but the staff felt nice and a lot of people seem to be enjoying themselves. \n\nAs I got to the room the keys would not work! I had to walk all the way back to the check-in and the staff told me he had given me a room that was already occupied, he then changed the room to the one next door (so I would not be lost). My girlfriend had to remind the staff to re-program the keys to the new room. After the staff assured me everything would be OKAY now I walk back to the room to find out it is a 1 king size bed room and not the double queen size bed room I had reserved. So I had to walk all the way back to the check-in again. When I ask the staff that I had order a double queen bed room he told me that it was more like a request but the type of room is not guaranteed! I have never heard that before! After arguing for a bit they agreed to provide a roller-bed for free. After another walk back to the room I found a big wet spot on the floor, by then I wasn't going to walk back and decided to call it a night. The room was pretty big but it was offset by the tilted walls, makes the room feel odd. Normally I would've probably given the hotel 2-3 stars.",0
"I didn't realize that Salon X would be a small room wihin a rented space in a strip mall.  I was being juggled  with 3 other people who were getting their hair done at the same time.  After having toner put in my hair, I was put right outside of the salon, in a waiting room chair.  My hair was wet, I had a towel draped on me, and random people who were shopping were walking by.  I didn't really think the cut was spectacular.  Not going back again.",0
"This restaurant is the reason that I created a yelp account. If I can prevent just one person from making the mistake that I made (going to Bravo Bistro) then I will be happy.\n\nI first heard of this restaurant on a local television program \""Check Please Arizona,\"" where it received good reviews. Needless to say, I went into this expecting a positive experience.\n\nWhen we sat down our first thought was that the menu seemed greatly inferior to the menu they had presented on the show. Undaunted, my girlfriend and I went against our initial impulse to seek greener pastures and ordered off the \""new\"" menu. I ordered chicken, and she ordered pasta primavera. Shortly after placing the order we were informed that there was no chicken. This was an hour into their dinner service, and we were the third table of the night. As an alternative the waiter was inconsiderate enough to suggest I try the cioppino, which I was willing to give a shot. In retrospect this was the second time we missed a queue to leave.\n\nWhen our food arrived the first sign that something was amiss was that the pasta primavera, which was described as containing a wide variety of vegetables, was angel hair pasta in red sauce. As a remedy the restaurant was happy to give us vegetables to mix in, which made their way onto the check in the form of an $8 charge.\n\nIf the pasta was bad, the cioppino was a disgrace to Italian Americans. It was bland, rubbery, uninspired, and $36! I felt like I had been conned by the waiter, who was rude and condescending throughout the entire ordeal.\n\nWhen we finally got the check a tip was out of the question for a many reasons as you can imagine, and while we were unhappy at the cost we were relieved to be able to head home and commiserate over a glass of wine. You can imagine our surprise when we received a call from the waiter, who used the number we had provided for reservations to reach out and express his displeasure. He yelled and screamed his opinions about us for several minutes, refusing to take any responsibility for our experience and heaping ridicule on customers that had just spent over $100 in his place of business.\n\nIn conclusion, this business deserves to fail. They are inept, disrespectful, and downright invasive. Their food is of poor quality and high cost. Go there at your own risk.",0
"Having seen two concerts here, TooL and NIN/Soundgarden, I have to say I enjoy the venue and the crowd control but I just cannot get into the accoustics no matter where I sit, the bass in particular getting muddy while cymbals seem to bounce around the room.  Thankfully gentle on vocals there are certainly worse places to see a concert, but for me this space seems better built for stage shows or spoken word than rock music.",2
I'm giving this place one star and that's being nice!! I've been coming to Cesar's for so many years and this is the worst!!! I can't believe that Cesar's is allowing this place in their hotel.  It's expensive and terrible!!! There were four of us and we all agreed.  I'm writing this sitting at the Bellagio coffee shop. We are eating breakfast here because we won't go back to Central! The breakfast at Bellagio is better and cheaper. Cesar's please help and get rid of this terrible place.,0
"This is in a great location in the heart of downtown.  The decor is very nice and the staff is friendly and attentive.  The drink menu was nice and varied with attention to not only specialty cocktails but also having a decent selection of more pedestrian fare.  However, this is a sushi bar and it all relies on the fish and rice.  And here is where it swings downhill quickly.  The fish used for nigiri was dry.  Even when it came out you could see that it was lacking a sheen of freshness.  The rice used complimented the dry fish.  It was typically a lump of poorly formed rice that seemed to have all the life sucked out of it.  I cannot recommend this place for sushi.  Rolls were good and we did not try any of the non-fish fare.",1
This place is great for brunch. We came there for lunch and made reservation through Open Table. We got seated outside which is a nice change considering we dined inside a lot in Vegas. \n\nI had the three fish tacos. It came with Green & Red Rice and also Black Beans. Tacos were tasty. Service was good and they accept restaurant.com certificate as well. Lunch for 4 after the certificate came up to $60. Not too bad for Vegas and well know chefs restaurant. We will be back.,3
"Have been there several times for breakfast and lunch and it has always been very good. The BBQ ribs are outstanding and most recently had the build your own egg skillet and it was excellent. I added Bacon, Jalapenos and Feta and it was just right. The bacon was crispy and the fresh Jalapenos add just the right amount of spice.",4
Bought 4 new tires here two months ago. Came in with a low tire they just filled the tire and said if it happens again to just bring it back. Didn't check the tire or anything. Brought it back two days later...took them over an hour to look at it. Said there was a screw in the tire. Need to replace tire but it will take 3 HOURS to get the tire here. Commented that I should have made an appointment yet when I came in two days ago NO ONE mentioned making an appointment. So much for being a TIRE center. Guess they don't value repeat business. Lesson learned...I have gotten much better service at Walmart. Save yourself the hassle and go elsewhere.,0
"I didn't know food at one Pita Jungle could differ from another.  I swore I would never return to this location after I witnessed an employee do something gross (sneezed in her palm, handled money, and then bare handed my pita), which I notified a manager of and it was rectified.  Fast forward a couple of years.  I return.  Wow.  The tofu at this location is fantastic.  The Macro platter here is worth the drive from where I am and I would drive past 2 other Pita Jungles.  Big fan.  The server was really nice.  I was at 0 stars when I walked in and became 4 stars when I left.",3
"Read my last review on this place before you read this, then compare. \n\nOnce again like in years past, the workers were having some kind of altercation with each other when I got there after midnight. \n\nLike usual the host lady had her back turned and pretended she couldn't see us waiting. She and the other host lady have been doing this for over 2 years. This time I asked the server why that lady always ignores us. He actually explained that she does in fact ignore guests intentionally and that she is just a very jaded and angry worker. \n\nI'm one of those guys who write detailed assessments of food, for example I might say: \""The quality and attention the chef put into perfecting the filet to a juicy medium-rare was impressive and well represented the integrity of this restaurant\"". But really, the only thing I can say about Grand Cafe is that the \""FOOD TASTED LIKE SHIT\""\n\nIf it's not bad enough that the clientele here are usually extremely drunk and shouting disgusting and stupid things, the food takes about 30-40 minutes to come out so you have to sit there the whole time and endure that shit. And most the time, the customers leave after about 20 minutes. I recommend not coming here anymore, even if you are at Santa Fe Station. Read my review of the Fatburger here at Santa Fe....I would still rather endure the service over there than eat at Grand Cafe. There are so many local 24 hour gaming bars around town that serve exceptional food and have great service and low prices. Just go there instead.",0
"First, the cost was ridiculously expensive.  I think I could have gone to Disneyland for less.  The animals lived in sub par conditions.  I was horrified to see their baby hogwarts in a glass room with electric blankets hanging down and the hogwarts nibbling on the electrical cords.  I was saddened to see the white tiger pace as they were in a cage too small and looked so unhappy.  On top of a very high admission fee, they also charged a few dollars for every attraction.  I will never return.",0

"Let me start by saying that if I could give no stars, I would after the \""customer service\"" experience we had.  \n\nIf you read any part of this review, read this:  \n\nGROUP FOOD POISONING AND HORRIBLE CUSTOMER SERVICE.\n\n\nI had been planning a really special bachelorette weekend for my best friend of 22 yrs for months and of course I wanted every bit of it to be just perfect as a wedding is a once-in-a-lifetime experience and arguably the most important time in a woman's life.\n\nWe flew into Vegas from NYC on July 18, 2013 and wanted to have a big dinner and rest our first night before celebrating the following 3 days.  \n\nI chose Yellowtail as the Bellagio would be a change of scenery (we stayed at the Cosmopolitan which by the way is AMAZING), and because it is a 5-Star property at which one would THINK they would be dining in a trustworthy, luxury place.\n\nWe ordered many dishes to share including tuna pizza, different sushi rolls, eggplant, shrimp tempura, beef and more.  \n\nThere were 6 of us in our party.  One of the girls  is vegetarian, so of course she did not partake in any of the seafood dishes.  Nor did I, as I don't eat fish. A 7th girl joined us in Vegas the following day, so she did not dine at Yellowtail. \n\nTHIS IS THE ONLY THING WE DID DIFFERENTLY FROM EACH OTHER THE ENTIRE FIRST DAY OF OUR TRIP which is how we know that the food poisoning came directly from Yellowtail.\n\nThe next morning, all 4 girls INCLUDING THE BRIDE, who ate the fish & sushi came down with debilitating food poisoning symptoms.  Vomiting and other issues that I'm sure I don't need to spell out, kept them literally lying on the hotel bathroom floor for the remainder of our trip. The poor things were hardly able to stand and we were thankful that we had a suite with multiple bathrooms or we would have been in an even worse state.\n\nOur trip, and more importantly, the Bride's special weekend (and more--this food poisoning spell triggered her to experience vertigo which she is still suffering from to this day), were COMPLETELY RUINED.  The girls spent all day and night feeling like they literally might die, and the 3 of us who did not experience the symptoms , were force feeding them Gatorade and toast so that they wouldn't be hospitalized in Las Vegas with dehydration.\n\n7 girls, 7 RUINED trips. \n\nWe couldn't do any of the fun things we had planned and wasted a lot of money and time that we will never be able to get back.\n\nWe called the Bellagio right away to put in a complaint thinking that they would AT THE VERY LEAST, refund our dinner bill as a courtesy for our extreme inconvenience.  \n\nInstead, they proceeded to give us the run-around for weeks, passing us off from department to department--Security to \""Guest Services,\"" to the restaurant itself, to the Light Group (who owns the restaurant), etc., and ultimately we were told that they would not be taking ANY responsibility and that we were basically sh*t out of luck. \n\nDO NOT EAT HERE.  Vegas has so many amazing and accommodating places to dine, and so many fun things to experience. Don't ruin your trip by eating at this irresponsible establishment.",0
"It doesn't get any better than this for BBQ in Vegas.  We got three appetizers; the Pork Belly with Grits, Deviled Eggs, and the Burnt Ends.  All very good, but the Pork Belly was over the top delicious.  My husband and I split a full rack of dry rubbed Spareribs which were very meaty, juicy and tender.  The rub was excellent.  We were only able to eat four out of the 13 ribs but the leftovers were great for noshing on the next few days at home.   The mac and cheese, and the collard greens were very good.  Glad we chose those.  Our server, Pauly, was so enthusiastic about the menu and the food we couldn't help but love him.  Looking forward to going back next week.",4
"Like many of you, I came here because of all the Yelp reviews. I'm new to town and had NO idea where to go. I heard about one of the \""Level 3\"" stylists from this site, but she was booked. So I went with a \""Level 2\"" stylist with a little hesitation. \n\nThey asked if I wanted a drink- red wine or otherwise- and I assumed it would have cost a ton, but then realized it was complimentary. Anything complimentary is a start to a good business relationship with new customers, for sure.\n\nThere weren't any awkward stylist/customer surface conversations- and paired with the glass of wine and a perfect cut, I was completely satisfied. I also got a substantial discount because their hot water wasn't working at the time and I didn't get a wash- which is totally fine with me. \n\nI'm definitely sold on this place and I'll be coming back for my next cut!",4

"I found RM Seafood to be lacking when I ate here with my husband and parents.  We ate in the \""downstairs\"" area and we found it to be pretentious and overpriced for the offerings.  \n\nThe Cioppino was bland and predictable.  For $36 dollars I was expecting a a hearty cioppino and was disappointed with a watery and tasteless meal.  :(  The Scallops were a complete disappointment.  $38 for 3 scallops on a schmear of black bean paste.  \n\nFor 4 people the total bill with wine was around $300.  Very disappointing for an unremarkable meal.  Go spend your money elsewhere.",1
"Camelback CrossFit (Formerly UHC Fitness) is AMAZING! Coach Matt & Dom are awesome. They push you without being mean.

Great hours for worker bees like me, great value compared to other gyms and nothing beats the people.\n\nCrossFit has gotten a bad rap in the press, but like any workout, it's what you put into it. Is it easy running in Arizona weather outside? No, of course not, but we all have to know our limits and Coach Matt and Dom are excellent at evaluating the strengths and limits of their athletes and will work with you to find a workout that is beneficial and safe.\n\nLook no further than Camelback CrossFit for the best workout and community you will find.",4
"I've only been to Cafe Habana once and it was en route to the Club Below Stairs which is further down Leith Walk.  The pub feels fresh and lively inside with quite loud music, modern decor and plenty of customers.  The service is quite fast and friendly and the bar is laid out in such a way that you which drinks are available and how much they cost.  The drink prices are as you would expect with \u00a31.90 bottles of beer and \u00a33 for a double spirit and mixer.  We just stopped off for one drink to send us on our way and we left impressed by the pub's atmosphere and lay out.\nSituated right opposite the Omni Centre and Edinburgh Playhouse, Cafe Habana would be an ideal place to go for a drink after a performance or before going on to Mood.  Further, it does plenty of its own entertainment with big screens showing sporting events and it even does its own karaoke night.  \nCafe Habana, although not the cheapest pub, is in an excellent location and has something to suit just about everyone.",3

"The mezza have always been above average, especially the tabouleh and sleek.  Service has been slow both times I've been in recently, which drops it from four to three stars.",2
"I have been coming to this place for about 7 years, back when it had a different name. All I can say is WOW!! this place is absolutely incredible. I am a native to vegas and have tried just about every mexican restaurant in town and this place beats them all.  I am a meat lover at heart, but when I come here all I order are their veggie tacos and burritos. I have tried other things on the menu and have never been disappointed. Everything is just so fresh. This place is always busy with a line of people, but I never mind the wait, its part of the experience. Ok im done now, go to los tacos.",4
So what a sham I went to this\n Show last nlght. At the box office I was told that the budget seats where sold out and would have to upgrade my tickets with a substanchial extra cost to me if I wanted to see the show. So I did. When I got in the theater the seating I requested originally had not a soul sitting in them. I felt lied to. I approached the manager and questioned what was going on after I had the bar tender dump a drink all over me by accident with no apology.rude .so I had to go dry off. As I talked to the manager and asked him to look for himself at all the available sections that they told me was sold out he refused to look or explain . He said tickets not refundable and shut us out of the main entrance. I have front row tickets I purchased for tonight and probably won't use because the theater is no way nice to the public. A SCAM.,0
"Rustler's Rooste is unique. I went with a large group as part of a conference but I can't even imagine going here as a regular dinner table of 4 people. The place is huge & loud. \nWhen we arrived we went in the door marked handicap access with my elderly mom. There was what looked like a hostess stand right there, but the young woman assigned there was not only clueless but she made zero attempt to be helpful. Initially telling us we had to go back outside & proceed upstairs to the main hostess. I said we'd entered via the marked handicap entrance intentionally but she looked at us with oblivion. I then explained we were with a large group that was sitting outside with picnic tables & without asking which group, pointed ahead & said to keep going \""past the slide\"" & we'd come to a doorway where a host could show us the way. We walked through a maze which included a dance floor & found no one, but we proceeded outside to where we saw groups. Eventually, a nice waiter was gracious enough to look up our group name & show us to our groups very nice private dining area. Once we arrived, we learned there had been at least 2 more direct and far closer routes. \nThe area our group had was really very nice. We had our own fire pit which was lit & of course the famous view of the entire Phoenix area. It was a really nice evening to be outside. \nThe food was set up in our own buffet & is served in cowboy style metal pie pans. The food was average, but portions were quite generous, with everyone getting a full half of chicken, beans, corn, salad & biscuits. They even brought more fresh, warm biscuits to our table. There was also large slices of what was probably the worse apple pie I've ever tasted on a separate buffet. \nOne of our guests learned that folks sitting inside got free cotton candy, so she got that ball rolling--a fun addition. \nWould I go back on a return to Phoenix? Likely not...this is more of a one stop novelty for me.",2
Worst pharmacy service ever! Messed up my prescription several times this year already.,0
After reading a lot of great reviews I decided to go here with my bf because we wanted to go out without going to a dance club. There was live music on the first floor when we got there so we had to go to the second floor to find somewhere to sit. We were seated right away but the service was slow. In her defense she was the only waitress for the entire floor. The music was really loud which made conversation difficult. We only ended up getting one drink because the service was so slow even though we were probably there for an hour and a half to two hours. Lucky for us there was a mistake and our drinks were put on someone else's tab who paid it so it was free for us! The Cosmopolitan is very pretty and the seating area was nice. The reason I'm giving it a lower review is because of the service.,2
Good Coffee taste with a good caffeine rush and with out breaking the wallet. Good customer service,3
Try Daves new juicy burgers.  Holy hell they are good!!,4
"The first time I went to Vegas and ate at market street cafe, i was in awe because they have a lot of my island favorites that I grew up with, the food was always hot and fresh, and the service was friendly. Fast forward a year and half and we waited in long lines each time, the service was slow and more than once we had to hunt someone down, and the food was never fresh or hot. I rate the first time a 5-star, and between that and the second time of 2-3 stars, I barely agreed to give a 4-star. I'm sure I'll give them another chance when I go because of how cheap the food is.",3
"It was good, but it didn't meet my Yelp great expectations.  It was also not really worth the loooooong walk out there.  I read someone's review saying it was just past the Wynn, but it is WAY past the Wynn, for anyone who's walking.  In fact, it's right before the Riviera, which is pretty far down.\n\nThat being said, the food was decent.  Between 3 of us, we ordered the Maserati omelet, waffle combo, and Munch's breakfast (a special).  All were pretty good, but a bit overpriced in my opinion.  Portions were huge.  The service was ok, a bit lackluster.  Our waitress was nice enough though.  I guess I'd come here if I was close but if you're not staying at the Riviera, I wouldn't make an extra trip to come here.",2
"The first time I went there for an oil change, they stripped one of the parts and I didn't know till I went somewhere else for my next oil change. The manager made it right no questions asked and even paid for my oil change! I will definitely be going back!",3
"I'd give it 2 and a half stars. It wasn't horrible, but it wasn't great either. My husband and I went to Handlebar J's when they first opened on Sunday. My chicken was a little too done. My husband asked for medium well on his steak, which means no pink, but don't burn it. Well, the outside was burned and the inside was too rare. He'll eat rare, but he'd rather it be cooked all the way through. What you really pay for there is the atmosphere. I think we will probably give it another shot though.",1
"The one thing this place has going for it is quality and freshness.  Quality is subjective of course, we are after all talking about fast food, The burgers are good(sauce is very nice).  The secret menu has some interesting things on it that I have yet to try, but im looking forward to it. Fries are ok, the malts are horrible, this from somebody who knows malts, born and raised in Wisconsin.  The malts here are too sugary and the flavor is off. 3.4 stars",2
"I've came here a couple of times for the Happy Hour and it was just ok. I always wanted to come back to try the restaurant portion (big fan of Cajun food) so when the groupon deal came up it was a perfect opportunity. Also great for a date night.  Anyways, the service was great. Our waitress was really fun, nice, and helpful with the menu and recommendations. We started off with a couple of cocktails which was crazy strong!! Well appreciated though! LOL. We got a basket with a couple of rolls and hush puppies which was pretty good. Nothing special. For entrees my bf stole my order of Shrimp Etouffee, so I ended up with the Crescent City Pasta. The Shrimp Etouffee was absolutely delicious! The Crescent City Pasta was really boring and just OK thanks to the crawfish and shrimps. Otherwise I would have to say the only flavor in it was butter. I was a bit disappointed in my entr\u00e9e, but as I said the Shrimp Etoufee is seriously mouth watering delicious. 3 stars goes to the awesome service and my bfs entr\u00e9e.",2
"Dr Seuss celebrates his birthday and this Friday the student's at my daughters school are wearing costumes or anything related to their favorite character.  I went here to check out the Dr. Seuss section which didn't have a lot to choose from.  I had looked at a few stores before coming here and couldn't find anything with the Big Cat on it, so I ended up buying this big Dr. Seuss Birthday hat and cool shades and a red bow tie for my daughter.  I am just going to have her wear red and we will be set!  I did spend longer in the store than I had planned walking aisle and aisle.  What a great selection that have on everything.  While I was there I picked up lots of things that were green for my families holiday - St. Patrick's day!    The staff were very helpful.",3
Great first 100 event! \n\nCame all the way from California to make it to this event. The store is beautiful and is updated with the heritage design. There is a drive thru. What I found great was that they have this beautiful table in the store that is made by the men in a prison ministry. Food was great no complaints...\n\nWonder if they use kosher pickles in their sandwiches. LOL I would ask that question to one of their workers... U should try it!,4
"I'm dating a Chinese dude, and we eat at some of the country's finest and most delicious Asian restaurants.  I feel pretty qualified to pass judgements on Chinese restaurants, especially with my main man by my side.  :)  That being said, I have definitely had better.  Now, a friend took me out to lunch here, so I'm not going to complain.  However, my honest feedback is that the lunch buffet is of pretty low quality ingredients and low to medium temperatures.  If you want your food hot, I'd such a later time of day perhaps.  I felt compelled to stick to the sushi after two failed plates full of fried, slightly cold food.  The sushi is a-ok.  :)  Hey, there aren't alot of options in East Mesa, so the price for even just the sushi makes it pretty darn affordable!",1
"My boyfriend and I have eaten here a few times, and so far, we have been very pleased with the service and quality of food.  They have a great wine selection as well.   It is not a place to go on the cheap though, so be prepared to spend a little cash.  \n\nWe stopped in on Friday evening to meet a friend for beverages and there was a blues band playing.  Alex Myrick (the owner) actually got up and sang with the band and played harmonica. He was great! \n\nI would definitely recommend Blue for a nice dinner or as a cool place to stop in for bevvies and appetizers.",3
"A little pricey, but they get the job done!",3
"Let me start my review by saying that I really wanted to like this place. The two star rating I gave it has NOTHING to do with the food and EVERYTHING to do with the lunch manager. \n   So we ordered lunch today for take-out. The girl who answered the phone and took my order was very nice & very well spoken...good start, right? My boyfriend went to pick up our very un-complicated order (a combo platter & the BBQ Queso appetizer) and commented that he liked it and that it looked like a place we may want to hang out sometime...another plus!\n   So anyway, we got out our plates & prepared to get down to business when I discovered that the BBQ Queso had been left out. DAMN! OK, so no big deal, people make mistakes. I picked up the phone to call them & let them know so they could have it ready for us to run over and pick it up. We were so excited about how good the other food looked that I actually didn't mind the idea of driving up there to get it myself. This is the part where they dropped the ball...\n   A nice girl named Sarah picked up the phone & I gave her the details. She asked me to please hold while she checked on it. A minute or two later, a man named Jim (I think) came to the phone and said very rudely \""Can I help you?\"" I proceeded to fill him in on the situation and mid-sentence he interrupted me and said \""Umm yeah...we haven't sold any BBQ Queso today for take-out. So what is it you want me to do for you?\""\n   OK, so at this point I'm annoyed. I asked him to check our ticket & see if we had paid for it. He responded: \""Yeah. I did that. Like I said, we haven't sold any of that for take-out today. Listen, we're in the middle of a busy lunch right now, so why don't you give me your number & I'll call you back later to figure out how to make this right for you.\"" Despite the fact that BBQ Queso wouldn't really do my any good hours AFTER we had our meal, I gave him my number & decided to give him a chance to fix it. We ate the food that we did actually get and it was the bomb. Seriously, very very good! (the silver lining)\n   Anyway, he never called back. I'm sure he had no intentions of calling back. Which got me thinking...this guy basically told me that he was too busy doing his job to DO HIS JOB. Its obviously his responsibility to manage the place & with that comes the task of resolving mistakes made by his staff. Hell, IMHO he should have offered to send someone over with it. Maybe Mr. Scibelli should consider giving the management position to someone more like Sarah, who knows how to speak to her customers respectfully. The food was great-- but my experience with the rude manager pretty much killed it for me.",1

"Beef salad: too salty and chewy\nPineapple fried rice: too sweet\nPanang curry: sauce is good, but pork is chewy\nSmall portion over all. Not recommended",0
Fairly decent Chinese in the middle of the Strip. We've ordered several things from Noodle Asia and the only things worth ordering here are the beef noodle soup and the Shanghai rice cakes. Service is terrible like most Asian restaurants. It's difficult even getting a glass of water.,2
"Let me begin by saying I have been a loyal customer, and thier owner (older guy with long hair) has been great to me. Unfortunately I recently had to re-do ine of my aquariums. Since I knew aquarium arts had fair prices and a large selection of freshwater fish, I decided  to do most of my shopping here. However I doubt I will ever shop here again after they way I was treated this evening. The owner was not there, and it was staffed by a crew of younger people who seem to try and do a good job. But one in particular ( tall slender guy with short hair and a short beard) was extremely rude to me. Since I have done lots of shopping there lately and spent a lot of money, I know he recognized me, and purposly treated me like shit. Why? No clue? I was asking about purchasing a 50 $ fish and the guy gets all grumpy, and rudely replies. He also refused to help or answer any questions. When I asked about something that was not priced, he got upset and gave me a ridiculous pruce on an aq ornament. What matters is if the owner is not there, the emploees know nothing about customer service. And they just lost a very loyal customer! The Pet Shop in mesa here I come!",1
"I'm kinda disappointed by this place.  After reading alot of good reviews i gave it a try.   First of all the place was totally empty, except for some people picking up an order.  It took the girls about 15min to take our drink order, I don't know why!!!!!  I went with my two small children, ordered the lunch special BOGO free on Tuesdays.  I ordered the riblets with coleslaw and the half chicken with mac and cheese. I thought it was gonna be enough for the 3 of us.  When the food came out i thought it was a joke or something.  I was like, where is the rest of our food!!!??   The servings are ridiculous!!!!!!!!!!!   I had to order an extra lunch special.   My 2 year old ate the super tiny quarter leg almost whole.   And my riblets were just so tiny  there was hardly any meat on them.  On top of that the food came out cold... What a BIG letdown!!   I will never go back.  I really don't understand all the hype about this place.  Maybe we went on the wrong day and time.   If you want good BBQ try H&H BBQ in NLV.   Also let me add that the Kool- aid has sooo much sugar its almost undrinkable...",1
"Sorry Mr. Matthew But i had to go inside to order. And i agree with you on the Nastyness. Didnt see the old man there sleeping but it was a mess in there. \nBut they make up for the great tasty food. I got the Sweet and Sour chicken dinner combination. With that i got a WonTon soup and some BBQ pork ribs, all was tasty and good. I got a menu to go so ill be ordering delivery next time and it will be soon. Ill be trying out some of their other items too. \nBy the way there is a .30 cent charge if you use your credit or debit. \n\nChing cho min cha. LOL",3

"I want to start this review by saying that I am a self-diagnosed froyo addict. So I was secretly bubbling with excitement when my friends suggested we stop for some on our way home from dinner on Sunday night.\n\nWelp, that excitement was short-lived.\n\nI surveyed the list of flavors U-Swirl had posted on their wall, then glanced at the available flavors posted above the soft-serve handles. Weird, a lot of them didn't match. \n\nI asked the kid working there what was up. \nHis reply: We are out of those\n...which was about four flavors.. and ironically all of which I would have chosen over what was available. \nSo fine, I settled for regular vanilla. So did my boyfriend. \nAnd, of course I didn't get that either because it ran out while he was using it. \n\nFlavor outage: count is at five at this point.\n\nWith dissappointment settling in, my heart remained hopeful. I went for the sugar-free vanilla. It tasted like crap with a grainy texture. \nSure, maybe it was due to the fact that it was sugar-free, but if it doesn't even taste good, why serve it?\n\nU-Swirl Scottsdale-- get your act together!\n\n[Side Note: In (somewhat of a) defense of U-Swirl, I used to live in Tuscon, and the U-Swirl location there was awesome! ]",0
"This place is another sad case of a confused restaurant who, in trying too hard to be innovative and sexy with flavor pairings, and trying to catch all the food trends, has achieved nothing but mediocrity. Not to mention that for the same prices I can get the real gourmet version of what they are trying to do at a strip restaurant. My Mahi Mahi was over cooked , and had a bizzare banana and curry sauce. The sushi roll we had was edible...if you are the type that likes American AYCE places. The best thing was the burger, which was ok, but for $17 I expected better grade beef and more interesting bun. The service was good. I liked the waitress but In the end, I don't think I would come back. Too many other better places to spend $100 on dinner for 2.",1
"the best thing at this restaurant is the Vietnamese pork banh mi lunch specials.\n\nGet the lemongrass-infused sausage (pork) and a side of asparagus or whtaever seasonal veggies they have on the menu.\n\nI'm used to banh mi costing me $2.50, but that's in a different US regional context.\n\nNice interior, I knew it as the former site of Sushi Muramoto's, which I adore. These are managed by the same owners, me thinks.\n\nThe BBQ could be better, given it's Madison.",2
"I absolutely am in love with the steak with blue cheese butter, but the last time I went, well it frankly just sucked.  It was Father's Day, so I'm hoping it was because they were so busy... but I hope the next time I go I won't be disappointed.  Please DONT start sucking!!!  I've been bragging about you for everrrr!!!!!",1

"I heard that this new restaurant opened up recently and wanted to check it out.   I'm not usually dining or hanging out in the Westgate area of Glendale, but I had tickets for the U2 concert.  So I got to kill two birds at the same time.\n\nI was hoping to eat here and was told by the hostess that there were no tables open before the concert.  I guess that's understandable since everyone and there brother was going to the concert.  Every restaurant was busy at Wesgate, but I managed to get a sandwich at another place and was back at Bice Bistro after my meal.  \n\nWhat drew me hear was the vibe inside the restaurant.  Wasn't ghetto or full of beer drinking fools.  It felt somewhat upscale, but with a Scottsdale sort of flair.  I ordered a glass of wine and sat at the nicely done wrap around bar.  \n\nNext time I come back I'll have to try the food to see if it lives up to my expectations I have set for the place.",3
"I've been to a lot of different pizza kitchens across America and honestly I have to say that this was the last place to try on my list. Now I definitely regret even putting this on my to do list, or my \""tackle the yummy\"" list.\n\nIt's a typical Sunday in Las Vegas, hot and windy. I Mountaintown Square on Las Vegas Blvd. and I'm hungry. So of course I would love to go try something new. Hence California pizza kitchen. So my mother arrives we decide to go in and try it. \n\nAll I can say is disappointing! The food lackluster and locked flavor. The presentation was less than heart. And the prices were outrageous. Not to mention their major competitor is Sammy's woodfired pizza. Sammy is offers gluten-free variations of pastas and crusts to appeal to a wider variety of people. To my surprise California pizza kitchen only has five pizzas that you can get the gluten-free crust and has absolutely no other gluten-free menu and no gluten-free pasta. Being a celiac this was disappointing! \n\nNow let's talk about the service. The gentleman seated us was very nice and the weather was nice but completely uneducated in anything that has to do with any aspect of anything Culinary. When I inquired about if they had pasta that was made without me because my son had a dairy allergy he replied \""well the only pasta with diary is going to be our fettuccine Alfredo or mac & cheese.\""obviously I know that Alfredo and macaroni and cheese obviously has \""cheese\"" and has Dairy. So why would I order that for my son? Wouldn't. Again I stated \""no, my son has all dairy allergies including eggs. So again that your pasta have eggs?\"" He quickly ran to go check and came back and stated that all their pasta egg. Again very disappointing.\n\nAll in all besides the lack of a gluten-free menu, the lack of ambience, the lack of an educated staff, and the outrageous prices, the food  was lack luster and was not visually appealing. Tasteless food never is a recipe for success. Maybe there other restaurants have better chefs? Maybe that's how they got so big? I'm not sure, however I am not on the California pizza kitchen bandwagon!",2
"Hugo's Cellar is an amazing find downtown on Fremont Street in, literally, the cellar of the Four Queens. It is so classic and old school Vegas, you really feel transformed back to when the waiters and owner knew your name and gave a damn about giving you a personalized experience. And I must admit, being given a rose when you arrive is a very sweet and romantic touch. I love how the salad is prepared in front of you at your table, and the steaks and wine list CANNOT be beat. I think we were all able to share one dessert at the end but I can barely remember, I was so full. This is definitely not a cheap place to eat, but a very memorable one.",4

man if there was a model of crap hotel this would be the perfect place. the rooms are not only old they smell of it. I had to shower with my plastic flip flops on. everything here is old...tables workers and dealers. grandpa fell asleep dealing in a middle of the shoot. I thought I was gonna have to call 911 bc I thought he was gonna croak on us at the table. the location is at the very end of the strip. I wouldn't recomment walking to strip at night from there although I have done it myself only bc I lost my 401k playing blackjack at Caesars and didn't have enough for a taxi back. I keep looking over my shoulder to see if I was gonna get robbed. pay the money for a nicer hotel!,0
"We decided to go with Vdara since their pool and the rooms looked nice, and we needed a place to relax after our week long road trip. I wanted to try out one of the city center places and, Aria didnt have suites\n\nI have to say, the room was pretty nice.\n\nThe reasons I am forced to give such a poor review, which I rarely do...\n\n1) We checked in at around 5PM; 20 minutes later someone opens the door and walks in, didnt even knock.. she comes in and looks at something and said she just wanted to look at the room map or something like that! .. for real? what if I was naked? or worse doing something else? \n\n2) The place has only valet.. which sounded nice at first, but if you forget something in the car, there is no way to go get it.. and of course you have to go downstairs and wait for your car..\n3) No coffee machines in the room? After floating in beer all day/night till 5Am, last thing I want to do is dress up and walk around looking for coffee when I get up. .\n4) So I finally force myself to shower and leave the place; I switch on the \""please clean room\"" light and leave for the day.. get back at 4PM.. the room is still not clean.. So i had to call the service desk and ask for someone to clean it.\n3) Since the lady was cleaning the roomwe go to the pool.. but when we get there, the pool is closed ! at 410PM!!! are you serious? they closed the pool at 4PM...\nAnd that was the whole reason we booked a room at this place..\n\n\n4) But the worst of all this is, even though it looks like its right next to the strip, its hard to get to from the strip. Mainly because they dont have directions anywhere , even inside Aria, and since they dont have a casino or any restaurants in Vdara, you are forced to go looking for places.. \n\nOverall, even though the rooms are super cool, staying here was a very painful experience. I give it only one star, and I will NEVER stay here again.. \n\nNow I know why I love Venetian !!  cant wait to go back there..",0
"It was my first time for lunch here today, and the interior decor is nice, they have some beautiful artwork. The bar area is nicely decorated with a big wine shelf. It is also a spacious restaurant with lots of tables...and they have outdoor seating as well. There is a piano on the left as you walk in, so I'm wondering if they ever have someone play it in the evenings. \nI got the most expensive thing on the menu just for the fun of it: crab & lobster crepes. It was just okay, I was sort of disappointed. Service is great though. Good hours, open pretty much all day every day except Sunday, I believe...\n\nI don't recommend the crab & lobster crepes, the crepe and the stuffing came separately and didn't taste all that great.",2
"This is a comfortable neighborhood Italian restaurant.  All the staples are here including pasta, veal and seafood. I had the veal marsala which came with a side of fettuccine alfredo.  \n\nWe also ordered a couple of bottles of reasonably priced sangiovese wine.\n\nFor dessert the tiramisu was large enough that the four of us could share.\n\nThe service was prompt and friendly.  Overall it was a nice experience.",2

"Came here just at random! I wasn't a big fan of anything.. The atmosphere or the food.. I got the 3 cheese sandwich and it was lacking some flavor.. My boyfriend got some limited edition buffalo sandwich which also wasn't all it was made out to be.. We also were limited on what could be ordered since they were out of certain soups and don't serve breakfast paninis after a certain time. Basically it's a downgraded version of zupas but pricier! Not an expensive place- but for what we paid we could've have a better meal, more options and a side of bread and chocolate covered strawberry ..",1
"As I walk through the valley of warm-fresh-soft-moist-fluffy english muffins I knew I was in heaven. I put that muffin in my mouth and I felt this warm fluffy sensation of yummyness in my tummy. This was such a great event! I only got a chance to sample their cakes and the cakes were amazingly delicious. Their apricot cake was absolutely my favorite. The fresh mango pieces inside the apricot cake were a pleasant surprise! I ate three pieces and told my fat-self slow down and move onto the tres leches- my second favorite. The tres leches had the right creaminess and moistness- wasn't too sugary either. Their cinnamon swirl buns were also a fantastic treat. The cinnamon bun was crispy on the outside and soft and \""doughy\"" on the inside. They also make their gelato in-house which I thought was very cool. Overall I liked that we got to hang out in their kitchen and get a sense of where all the magic happens. The staff was all very polite, friendly, professional, and knowledgeable.  I'm glad I got exposed to this amazing bakery and want to thank Lindsey and LGO bakery for making this happen!",4

"In transit to or from Westgate, you have probably overlooked Sammy's B&G. It's a relatively new bar, with a diverse crowd that I cannot pigeonhole. No really, you'll find everything from 21-year-old floozies warming up to the bar scene, to old bikers rolling in with chains and leather jackets.\n\nMost everything at this place screams \""Mediocrity!\"" The food is nothing special. It's the same greasy stuff you'll eat anywhere after downing a few drinks. The DJs aren't playing much outside the garbage you're already hearing on some trendy radio station. I appreciated the live music they had one night...even if it was just an average bunch of stoners playing average reggae covers.\n\nBut if there's any redeeming factor, it's the price of the drinks. Even on a Saturday night you can get a pint and a well for $5 (2.25 and 2.75, respectively), and I think that's just awesome. Even though everything about this bar is middle-of-the-road, you're gonna love your bar tab at the end of a drunken night.\n\nWith regards to the management\n\nSammy's has the potential to be a lot more...once it figures out what it wants to be. There's even a sign on the jukebox that says \""NO rap, NO heavy metal until 8:30\"". Pair that with being pestered about my age after drinking there several times, and I can tell the owner does not want this to be an oasis for thirsty twentysomethings. \n\nGive it a chance anyway and enjoy a few--your wallet will stay full.",2
"Been there a couple times in the past...Dont know what all the hype is...Went there yesterday 1/23/14..Cashier unpleasant to work with..She wasnt paying attention..\nI find the menu a little over priced for the end result...

The mac and cheese was weak at best...ive had better Craft from the box...Im not a big fan of RC fountain drinks...(wtf is up with that ?)   When i went to put my tray away the garbage can was over filled with trash on the floor next to it..I balanced my tray on top and quietly left..Not a \""goodbye\"" from the counter or a \""yall come back\""    nothing.... \n  What happend to this place ?  Did they change owners ?  I just dont get it...\n                                                                                                          I dont think ill be back /",1
"The short of it: I'm not sure I would pay regular price here too often, but I always enjoy my free birthday bowl immensely. And it's gotten better the more I've learned to add enough salt and spices.\n\nThis is the only Genghis Grill which I've been to, and other than that, I haven't really had too much so-called Mongolian barbecue aside from mall food courts. The premise is that you can pick your own meats, starch, and flavors and have them cook it on a giant hot metal flattop.\n\nThe routine starts as follows: you're seated, a server asks you if you want appetizers or alcohol / bar seating (both of which I've never bothered with), and then you go to the line to choose your food. If you're lucky, there won't be much of a line and you'll get more time to weigh your options. If not, then think on your feet. As others have said, it's your own damn fault if you don't get a flavorful dish.\n\nAn employee will ask you if you want a small, medium, or large bowl. I thought I could have eaten a little more after the medium. You get to pick from a variety of proteins, spices and seasonings, and sauces. Definitely load your main bowl at least to the rim with proteins. I would stick to the ones that have recognizable meat texture, which for me were the marinated steak tips, pork, and marinated white fish. The chicken looked unappetizing and there was no way I was using the processed meats. Further down the line are various vegetables that you might also consider adding. I wouldn't add too many aside from mushrooms, onions, and maybe carrots since I'm all about meat.\n\nThe next two steps are so important that they get their own paragraph. You need to add spices and seasonings because there won't be enough from the meats, starches, or even the sauces. Use the tiny spoons to get several heaping spoonfuls of different granulated flavorings (such as garlic, ginger, cayenne, and yellow curry). Finally, you'll arrive at the sauces. Use a sampling spoon and try a sauce. If it's not that tasty, get another spoon and sample another sauce. Pick one or two that you like and ladle it into the small sauce bowl. I enjoy the 3G sauce, but you might not.\n\nFinally, walk to the counter near the grill and present your bowl. They'll ask which starch you want. I picked udon noodle, but maybe you'll want rice or something. You can ask for 1 or more eggs to be added to your bowl here. They used to have eggs for you to grab in line, but I'm guessing too many of them dropped and broke. I believe you may be able to ask for a premade combination at the grill counter, but I wouldn't bother with that unless you're very lazy.\n\nGrab a drink and maybe some condiments from the back area after you drop off your bowl to be cooked. They have those fancy Coca Cola machines that dispense seemingly hundreds of flavors from one spout. There's soy sauce, sriracha, and other things. Go back to your seat and wait an employee to present you with your bowl of cooked food. Eat and enjoy.\n\nI will make this point again so that it's very clear. If you didn't add enough spices and whatnot, don't expect too many good things out of the bowl. You can probably still salvage it with the other condiments and some salt and pepper, and then you can berate yourself. It probably took me at least a couple of visits until I learned this lesson, and I'm so glad I did.\n\nIf you want a nice hot bowl of some Asian-inspired flavors with plenty of meat and some carbs, this is a good option. You know what flavors you're getting because you're designing the recipe, and that sure bet is probably worth $12 or so on a regular basis for some people.",3
"I casino hopped a bit on Fremont St. this past week in search of good gaming and Golden Gate was my favorite.  Not only was the Pai Gow $5 (which lets me play for a lot longer before I run out my daily gambling budget) but they had the best Pai Gow dealers of anywhere I visited this week.  One in particular, I'm trying to remember her name, I think it was Maya or something similar, really had a fun personality.  The pit boss was also super nice and spent a lot of time helping my honey with his first games.  They were nice to the noob college kids at the table who made rookie faux pas and corrected them very gently, which I appreciate since I'm pretty new to table games myself and hate it when they act like everyone should already know the etiquette which isn't actually posted anywhere.  But I digress.\n\nPlus, they have a Du-par's!  I didn't even know Du-par's existed anymore!  I grew up near the one in Thousand Oaks, CA that is no longer there anymore and have many fond memories of breakfasts there with my grandparents who are no longer with us.  It sure was a blast from the past eating there!\n\nI don't know if I'd stay there, I don't know anything about the rooms, but I will definitely be Pai-gowing here on my next visit!  If they had electronic craps too they'd be perfect :)",3
"Lunch with the girls?  Want to impress your Mother-in-Law? Show that snobby co-worker what's up? Chelsea's is it!\n\nYumyumyum!  The food is unbeatable.  Fresh and hip, with traditional roots.  We had brunch fare: Perfectly cooked eggs, potatoes that melted like butter, sausage heaven. \n\nYour order will be served up with class by the fabulous wait staff.  Oh and the location!  Natural beauty abounds.  I can't wait to come back.",4
"If it wasn't for the mediocre to bad service this would be a 4-5 star place easy! The food is spectacular, hands down my favorite BBQ in Las Vegas. As usual with The District, parking is terrible, and the wait is usually 45 minutes to an 1 hour+.\n\nHappy hour is great and the live music in the bar makes for a great place to have a couple beers and hang out. Best service is in the bar.",2
"Decor is elegant, yet inviting and interesting. Great patio when it's cooler out.\n\nMartinis are a must, theyre kind of known for them.\n\nI think the picnic sandwich is one of my all time fave sandwiches. So much sandwich, not to mention the sides that they pile on as well.\n\nStaff is always friendly and attentive.",3
"THis has been on my list for a while but rarely do I get to this side of town. I liked it! I'll be back, let's break it down\n\nAtmosphere: Clean, well lighted,,, I felt healthy walking in. Smells fresh.  Basic seating set up.  I went at 11:30 Saturday and it was not too crowded,, people there but not too much.\n\nFood: That's what you're here for right? The best description again is,,, clean.  Seems to me that it's all natural organic type food.  I've had burgers, Avocado/Crab cups, and some of the drinks.  Burgers are surprisingly juicy, and I'm looking to try some of the salads next time.\n\nDrink: Note the smoothies are like a meal so you probably don't want that AND a full meal unless you are splitting.   The juices are all very nice and clean.  Favourite is the Wellness drink.\n\nPrice: For what it is,,  a little expensive,, a juice and any meal will be twenty.  One of the other Yelpers claimed it was the Whole Foods of restaurants and I think its a great comparison.\n\nMiscellaneous: One of the few places I can think of that put calorie counts.",3
"So, SO good. I'm new to Las Vegas, and was craving Indian food tonight. After dinner tonight I am completely satisfied.\n\nWe started with the samosas - delicious. Crisp on the outside, a little spicy on the inside, and whatever that green dipping sauce was - yum. :) Dinner was the Chicken Tikka Masala and an order of the plain Naan.   My boyfriend and I decided it was he beat naan we have ever had. (Not to say we KNOW Indian food, but we have had enough to compare!) I loved the spice to the Masala too. I ordered mine medium-hot, and it was perfect. \n\nThe only thing I'd say that could improve after this first trip would be the service. It was a little slow, my water ran out a couple times (spicy food + small water glasses = water refills for me), and one of the employees (family-owned I'm assuming) had a phone that kept ringing which was a little annoying. However, I'd say if you order an appetizer, you'd be fine. \n\nI'll definitely be back!",3
The website and sign on door said they close at 2:00 on Saturday. We drove all the way over and arrived at 12:45 and the doors were shut. I called the store and they stated that because it was a holiday weekend they closed at 1:00. They must have trouble with numbers and telling time because the doors were locked at 12:45. A tile place that has trouble with math? Not some a place I'd like to do business with. Totally unprofessional. Off to AZ Stone. Always been super happy with them!,0
Great place on Tuesday for cheap tacos and beers.  The outdoor patio is awesome when the weather is nice.,3
"This hotel is located inside of Mandalay Bay which was convenient for us since that was where we were staying. We didn't want to eat too much because we wanted to save room for drinking later. We ordered sweet potato fries, zucchini fries & an order of chicken wings. We didn't order a burger because when I looked around, they seemed pretty big and I knew I wouldn't be able to finish it.\nI thought what we ordered would be something for us to munch on and keep us full temporarily until later that night but we were pretty filled up and didn't even end up eating dinner later!\n\nWe didn't have much of a wait but then again, we went at an odd time (4:00-4:30pm). Our waitress was very friendly and our food came out really fast.\nOverall, we were very satisfied and will definitely eat here again the next time we're in Vegas.",3
"The BBQ: We got the three meat combo (pulled pork, hot link, & brisket) and they were all pretty dry. We got the mashed potatoes as a side and they were extremely bland and completely void of any salt, pepper, butter, or anything. \n\nI've had he burgers at the grill in the past and it was of much better  than the BBQ.",1
"The combination of the HCG program and the support provided by the folks at TrimBodyMD helped me lose 37 pounds in just under 8 weeks. I started the program mid-March and finished in Mid-May. As I approach 90 days after the diet I have to say that I have been able to maintain my new weight fairly easily. I get full relatively quickly and I don't have to be very strict in my food selection. I did the food delivery option and was very happy with it. The food was really good and the fact that it was all taken care of made it that much easier. I really didn't have an excuse because the food was always pre-measured to be the right portion and at the same time provided all of the nutrients in the right proportions to help power my weight loss. The diet initially scared me off because of I really like to eat and the thought of having so few calories a day made me worry. Those worries were soon calmed after Jon convinced me to just give it my best for 7 days. In the first 7 days I wasn't hungry and I had lost 6lbs.  Those kind of results really got the momentum going and I didn't really look back from there. Throughout the diet I had great energy levels and learned that I LOVE fresh fruit. Also to note, I had to travel a few times when I was on the diet and with the right coaching on how to approach my meals, I was able to maintain my weight loss trajectory even while on a cruise. If you can lose weight on a cruise with all of that tempting food around you can lose weight anywhere, no excuses.\n\nI have been over-weight for at least 30 of my 37 years. I have tried every diet you can think of and have over time had different results, but none that have been as effective and efficient as this program.  The only other time in my life that I have been even close to where I am at now was a couple of years ago leading up to my 35th birthday. I was able to get loose weight and get in shape, but I was exhausted. It was probably because I was eating the wrong things and I was running 25 miles/week.  During my TrimBodyMD program I did exercise a couple of times a week, but really nothing too intense per the advice of my TrimBodyMD coach, Mike. The coaching and support made all of the difference. The team at TrimBodyMD reached out to me via text and email to encourage me and as how I was doing. Knowing that I wasn't alone and that answers to my many many many questions was just a call away made me feel confident that I could really do this.\n\nI don't know what to say other than it worked for me. It worked because I committed myself to giving it a chance to work for the first week and then the results and the motivation that came from those results powered me through. If you give it a week or 10 days you will probably have similar results. This is a zero cheat diet. If you are not committed to losing weight, you will cheat yourself and it will not work, period.\n\nOverall the experience has been awesome. My co-workers and friends have been astounded by how different I look after having lost so much weight. I feel really great about having done the program and I am so stoked that even after 90 days I have been able to keep the weight off.",4
"This isn't a super nice hotel, but it is great if you want to cook for yourself or stay for an extended period of time the staff is nice the rooms are clean and everything works. They may not have wifi but they do have plug in internet which is what I prefer. When I was between houses it was a great place to stay. You do have to realize that it isn't a five star like a lot of people are wanting in the bad reviews, but it is a place for longer stays. \n\nCheers!",2
I just stopped at BevMo to purchase a few items.  They carded me!  I asked why and he stated that they have a policy of carding anyone that looks under 50!   That is a stupid policy and I have a policy of not spending money at places with stupid policies.  \n\nBye bye!,0
Un endroit tr\u00e8s petit mais tellement rempli de bons produits utiles pour pr\u00e9parer du savon maison.

Les prix sont imbattables !\n\nNice cosy place full of what ever you need to prepare home made soap and lotions. I regularly buy there when ever I need anything for my cleaning and hydrating prepearations. Prices are unbeattable !,4
"I know that this may come as a shock to the other reviewers on here but my service was less than stellar.  I came home and did a walk through of the house and found that my dining room was hardly touched, dining room chairs were partially done and the hanging lamp over my dining room table had cobwebs on it still as well as the console table was not dusted thoroughly.  In addition, once I went into my 2nd bedroom, I found that it had not even been dusted.  Vacuumed, yes, but not dusted.  Nothing had been moved for dusting on the table tops.  I am disappointed.  One positive was that Jason listened to my concerns and thanked me for the feedback.  Other positive the floors looked really good.  I don't think I will use this service again.  Maybe I expect that once you have your house cleaned it should be sparkling.  Just me, just saying.",1
"Had Cupcake Cafe make 2 dozen yummies for my company's Employee Appreciation Event. Not only was Nicki an absolute pleasure to work with, she is responsive, friendly and creative. She made the prettiest swirled cupcakes in our corporate colors and they were DELICIOUS!!! I consider myself a bit of a cupcake connoisseur and Nicki's cupcakes are one of the best cupcakes I've had in Arizona! To top it off, they deliver! I highly recommend them and will definitely be using them again. Thank you, Nicki!!!!",4
"Great Links got me started on a gourmet hot dog quest, which landed me at Buldogis. It's a typical, small hot dog shop/diner, serving up some really yummy creations. You can get anything from bulgogi to their take on a Chicago dog for toppings, even as a vegetarian hot dog, if you prefer. My favorite here is the west coast dog, topped with grilled onions, cheese, and seriously, the most delicious avocado mayo. I prefer a real Chicago dog to their version, but maybe they felt the need to switch it up because they are next door to Chicago Brewing Co.",3
Solid gyro for the money. Haven't had anything else on the menu. Place is always empty so I'd expect things to move a little quicker and the fries to be not over done. This is the best gyro place in the area however so I'll keep coming back,2
"I truly wanted to be able to give a 5 star review for the hotel, but I just can't do it. I had been to The Clarendon on several occasions as I am a huge fan of Gallo Blanco, but this was my first time staying at the hotel. \n\nThere were several of us that stayed at the hotel for my sister's bachelorette party, so we ended up booking four rooms total. I had called weeks in advance about getting a discounted room rate and one wasn't really available for a group our size. (I think they require 9+ rooms for a group rate which seemed pretty standard with all of the hotels I had checked in with). 3 of the rooms were ready upon our arrival around 1 PM. My parents came later in the day, around 4, and their room was not ready. They had to wait over an hour for the room to be available. \n\nWe booked a cabana for our stay, and for the $200 it cost, It was absolutely not worth it. The seating area was decent size, but there are no lounge chairs around it and minimal sun. All of the lounge chairs on the opposite side of the pool were already taken, so there was really nowhere to lay out. In my opinion, there should for sure be dedicated lounge chairs if you are paying to reserve the cabana. Water, soda and ice were included with the cabana, but there was only one person working the entire pool area, so requesting these things was rather difficult. The poor guy that was working the pool area did his very best, but one person simply wasn't enough for all of the people out there and drinks averaged about 30 minutes to arrive. To me, this is totally unacceptable. \n\nThe rooms themselves were okay. We had two beds in our room and these were rather small. I believe they were doubles instead of queens which resulted in my bf's feet hanging off the bed. The single rooms are kings, so just be prepared if you need two beds that they will be smaller. The room came stocked with a Keurig and Philosophy bath products as well as robes, so those were all pluses. The biggest issue was how warm it was. We were in a room with high sun exposure and the wall mounted air conditioning unit just wasn't cutting it. We were sweating all through the night and it made sleeping super uncomfortable. \n\nAll in all, Clarendon certainly wouldn't be my first choice for a stay in the downtown area, but  it was decent. I just think the $200+ a night stay was wayyyyy too much for the quality of the room and service we received.",2
"This is a great place to go to during the summer time. I love sitting out on the patio. I got the chicken sandwich and my friend got the Pittsburgh salad. I would totally recommend getting any of the salads. The steak salad looked amazing (the people next to us got it) and the Pittsburgh salad tasted delicious. My sandwich was fine, but nothing to write home about. Overall, it was a good experience and will most likely be back.",3
I have tried the Frozen Yogurt here. However i don't like it much. its more like Icecream or little bit melted. I like Yogurtland much better. It's not bad at all. However i prefer Yogurtland.,2
"I LOVED kinaree when it first opened ordered it 2x a week, awesome fresh food great veg menu, but  now every time i order the quality slowly deteriorates, sauces are getting oily and today I found a huge string of plastic in the egg rolls. Will be looking for another place",1
"I came here for the sports book-obviously, but I ended up enjoying the chic sports bar food way more than I expected. I had my own suite and could watch any game I wanted which was great. Unfortunately, I was betting on baseball games during the hockey playoffs and had a lot of trouble getting service despite my private area and advance reservation. I had to go to the hostess station 5 times to get service and order my food. For the price, I expected better service.  I would absolutely recommend going to this sports book if you are looking to bet and don't go during the hockey playoffs lol.",3
"Great place, goes well with the area and the crowd here is very trendy and \""quiet\""\nOne of the downfalls is that they can have you waiting for some time. \nFood is great and the drinks menu is very vast.",2
"Spitfirez has the best food around, from their homemade soups, sandwiches, salads and daily specials you can't go wrong. I've tried just about everything on the menu and was never disappointed.  The staff are friendly and service is great.  You got to try them out!",4
"It's a good Safeway.  Predictably good meats and produce, and some of the bakery items are pretty good too (artisan breads).  Not the cheapest of the groceries. Shop the sales and you can save some money.\n\nThis one is particularly cool because they cater to an older crowd (Sun Lakes).  So they have some better stuff, in my opinion.  Less of the kids junk food (Lunchables and that crap), and more stuff to appeal to grown-ups.  They have the kids' stuff, too, but you can tell the difference when you shop here.",3
"Awful, dirty, food not cooked all the way, shakes are with syrups!!!awful.  Will never go there again, workers are rude.",0
"I am only giving this place 2 stars because there is only one employee that is a professional and she is the ONLY reason why I go there, other than that this place feels like the scene on Menace II Society when the Asian woman follows the guy throughout the store. \n\n07/06/13 at 0930 I went there to buy some hair extensions. The owner was also coming in the shop. I greeted her and she rolled her eyes at me . ( strike 1!)\n\nAs soon as I went to the back to grab the hair I wanted this young brunette w/ glasses asked me if I needed anything. I told her I was deciding on what color extensions I wanted. And when I tell you she was hovering over me, she was so close that I could smell her breath. Then while I'm going to the next aisle to find  a shampoo....she's literally FOLLOWING ME! ( strike 2)\n\n07/08/13 1600 hours I realized I needed 1 more pack of extensions. Just go in , buy, & leave! As soon as I walked in I was greeted by a distant voice. As soon as I walk to the back I hear foot steps moving fast in the other aisle . TA-DAA! The brunette is there \nFOLLOWING ME as usual. Its really pathetic because she followed me the whole time.\nShould I use the race card? No but this place is bad business and over priced. Buy online and save your self from tempting to elbow a worker because she is treating you like a thief. (Strike 3! I'm out!)",1
"I've heard a lot about this place and nachos are my life so we went in with really high expectations, so maybe that's why my dinner was so meh. \nI ordered the Daddy's Margarita and that was awesome!!!!\nAlso good? The bottomless chips and salsa. Everything was pretty blah from there.\n\nI got the Tostada nacho appetizer for dinner. The seasoning on the meat was like...they tried to do Mexican flavors but got confused or were missing the right spices and used something else. It was just weird. And I totally appreciate super loaded nachos... these were just too much. \n\nMy husband got the buffalo chicken nachos and got approximately 3 tiny pieces of buffalo chicken on them. \n\nThank god for the bottomless chips and salsa or we probably would've gone hungry. \n\nOur server was great and had an awesome sense of humor, so that helped. I'm glad we went and tried it out, but I don't think we'll be going back.",1
Ah man one star is pushing it. I was waiting in line knowing that the food I was going to get wasnt worth the wait. \n\nThere's really nothing wrong with the people that work there. The issue is that there is one cash register and one person taking your order.  Meanwhile there are 5000 guys in the back cooking the meals. They really need to open another register up. The food was eh but I wasn't expecting anything much  more. \n\nSo one star for the bottleneck place.,0
"The with a group of 20 you would think they could keep the tables with there own checks... Nope, very poor choice to keep the group up so they could charge the 18% for the bad service. We had to wait over a hour for food items and the place wasn't even busy. .... Food was ok drinks were ok also the place really has potential but very bad Managment. We has a very popular restaurant manager with us and he was shocked at the treatment. Separate bills  shouldn't be a issue ..... We liked and hated this establishment.",1
The King Taco of Vegas !\n\nI love this place. Get the Adobada Pork! The sauces arent as spicy as the King Taco sauces but their sauces are on point. I usually get the tacos. The Carne Asada fries and the Adobada fries were both fails. Stick to the tacos. Its a little off the strip but its worth it. This is the perfect place to come when you're hungover and broke from losing all your money on the strip.,3
"The poor rating is mainly because of slow and poor service!  The food has always been delicious - but then again, it is a chain restaurant and they all generally taste the same.  Their store is nice and neat,  but sometimes the bathroom is in dire need of a thorough scrub-down cleaning to get rid of odors.    \nI generally visit this location in the late afternoon between 3:30 - 4:30PM, just before the dinner rush.  Therefore, it wasn't crowded when I went in.   One time I walked out ten minutes after I had been seated by the host; no one ever showed up to take my order. However, just as I was picking up my things to leave, a waitress appreared.  Too late -  I don't have time now!!    On another occassion, my meal arrived and part of it had spilled all down the side of the bowl and the other bowl had stray pieces of corn in it.   Regardless of the poor appearance of the food, as well as the the foreign bits of corn in my greens, the food was still very good.   Quite frankly, the server didn't seem to notice how messy it was.    More often than not, the main problem is getting the food in a timely manner - even on to-go orders.  One time I placed a to-go order at the front counter and it took 15 - 20 minutes for the food (Beans & Greens!!) to come out.  It's a good thing I didn't order chicken or a burger!!!    As stated, the food IS good, but the wait is rediculious.",1
Caution on gas price. This company uses very small print on their low gas price. When you get to the pump is 10 cents higher then what you expect. The print on the gas sign is very small. I would call this deceptive advertising .,1
if there was a way to rate zero stars I would. I'm absolutely frustrated with these guys. Took car into get a simple oil change cuz I had gotten a coupon to do so for half off. when i got the car back there was a broken clutch. wtf???? they offered to fix it for half the cost and i said no. it's your fault for breaking my clutch.. soo they blew me off... towed the car back to my house.. eventually i had to get the car repaired somewhere with a new clutch installed. forget these guys.. will NEVER go back here again.. even the corporate customer relationship guy from higher up asked me if i was doing okay over a phone call a few weeks later. that's all...didn't care that i bought a new clutch.. whatever...all i know is i will never go back there again.! Trust me...they don't care about you one bit.... at all...,0
"I'm a graduate student with no dental insurance, who had the unfortunate experience of having a (grain of rice sized) chunk of her tooth fall off.  The good news is that there was no pain; the bad involved my experience at First Choice Dental on South Park Street.  I am only giving a rating of two stars because the receptionists were extremely polite and kind.  I spoke to one of them on the phone for at least 5 minutes as we tried to arrange a time for me to come in.  \nAfter my interactions with them the politeness stopped and the bullying began.  The dental assistant was more interested in fixing her computer monitor that was crapping out than the patient. She crammed the X-Ray machine in my mouth and basically told me to tough it out while she fiddled with another computer for at least 2 minutes. (which is a really long time when some huge machine is chafing your effing mouth)  The dentist explained to me that I would need an expensive crown for about $1600.  He tried rationalizing it to me that it was \""mere pennies a day\"" as this crown was going to last me 20 years. Additionally, the dentist (thinking that I was one of those uninsured eccentric millionaires) suggested that I get 4 of my other fillings replaced too as they were cracking.  Both of these people seemed to not hear me say at least 4 times, \""I'm not insured.\""  I requested a temporary filling for the problem tooth no less than 3 times in which the dentist flat out refused.  \nAt the end, I was ushered into a room where they discussed finances with me, and suggested that perhaps I ask my parents for help in order to get a crown or maybe I could take out a loan from a bank that they endorsed.  \nI hope it was that they just hate poor people, and they treat insured people better. (who probably have no choice but First Choice)",1
"My fiance was in search for Scotch and Soda for his brother's birthday (for nostalgia), and we walked into Houdini Magic Shop in the Planet Hollywood Miracle Mile Stores.  On our first visit, the gentleman behind the counter was tidying up, and answering questions... nothing too exciting.  We looked around, gawked at the masks on the tops of the shelves, and checked out what basic magic tricks they had available.  We found the Scotch and Soda for about $30, but we wanted to see if any of the other magic shops had it for a lower price.\n\nWe came back the next day after visiting another magic shop that had Scotch and Soda, but it was the same price, and extremely packed inside the store.  This is when we met Don (the funniest magician/salesman).  Don was incredibly friendly, and showed us a few magic tricks while we were looking to purchase Scotch and Soda.  To his advantage, my fiance and I are like two children who are easily amazed.  We watched him perform the disappearing card deck and the floating coin/card.  After spending 30 minutes in awe, it took a lot of self control to walk out with just Scotch and Soda.\n\nWe returned the following day to purchase the disappearing card deck as birthday present part 2, and Don showed us a couple of new magic tricks at the time.\n\nI think that if it hadn't been for Don, we would've made our purchases at another Magic Shop, but because he's so personable and hilarious, we came back to this store.  This shop is definitely worth a visit!",2
"Im pretty sure I read about Kim Kardashian's engagement, wedding, and divorce all while I was waiting in the 100 yard line to try on clothes here. Seriously, what takes so long to try on clothes?!

I do, on occasion, find some cute top or dress from here that I end up purchasing cause I can't believe the price. But, I'm quickly reminded as to why the price is cheap when I pull my top out of the dryer. This store also has shoes, hats, sunglasses, and jewelry to help accessorize you outfits and these items do seem to last longer then Kim K's marriage :)\n\nAlso, expect to wait long for checkout as well. Those extra two employees, behind the register that aren't open, are probably doing something important.",1
Was very satisfied with the Beef Burrito a very awesome place to go and fulfill your mexican food craving ...will be coming back for more,4
"2 1/2 Stars***\n\nIn terms of Las Vegas buffets, Flavors is just alright. Food was decent, they did have crab legs which I appreciate. And they have yummy desserts too! Small portions so you can either A. not feel bad about yourself or B (my option) can try multiple desserts at once. \n\nFood is just ok. They have their typical buffet food, Italian, Chinese, Tex Mex, and a decent sized carving station. But yeah, nothing out of the ordinary. And I've eaten at some tasty Vegas buffets. But you get what you paid for.",1
"This place smells like chocolate, is filled with bon bons, and has a high red tin ceiling. Its less factory and more commercial.\n\nI picked the Inspiration shakes and made my own with three scoops for $5; peppermint stick, black raspberry chip, and coffee. Sounds terrible, was actually awesome.\n\nThe girl that was helping us was the only one on the clock and it was slow but ya gotta have sympathy for the only milkshake mistress.\n\nFor a place that calls itself the Milkshake Factory, the milkshakes should have had a thicker consistency. I'll go elsewhere for a better shake.",1
"I wish there was a ZERO star option because they dont even deserve one star. This store is just awful. But its not just the store, customer service dont give a shit either. They dont care about you and they never will. I went crawling back to Verizon after the nightmare i went through dealing with sprint for 55 days and going to this location for my issues that they caused and would not resolve. I couldnt be happier to have sprint out of my life. I would gladly pay their etf fee anyday over having them as any service provider. Suck it Sprint and take notes from companies like Verizon or Tmobile because you guys are just terrible!",0
"I'm a fan of this place, who can't be with three separate bars to go to?  Even if it is packed most weekends.  With the three separate bars it's like three separate atmospheres. \n\nDownstairs is the kind of cool, kind of hip bright bar where if you want to get up close and personal with someone, you can.  The jukebox has an ample selection of tunes to choose from to tickle just about anyone's fancy.  On the colder days you can stand by the fireplace to warm yourself.  On the warmer days you can still stand by the fireplace, but don't worry, it's not on to roast the patrons.  It serves as a place to lean against and carry on a conversation with someone and be able to set your drink down if you like.  Several high tables dot the area if you feel the need to sit as well as stools around the bar.  Big windows allow you to view the people walking on the street as well as it lets them view you.\n\nUpstairs is kind of the dim lit, low-key lounge bar.  Electronic dartboards for play, some Saturdays the dance floor can be in use if a DJ is on premise.  Nice big, somewhat circular bar in the middle with stools (they are in the middle of a remodel by the looks of it, to make it look even roomier).  Booths and high tables are available for sitting as well.  A coat rack is there for you convenience to place you coat, but be careful, especially if you're wearing a coat that looks similar to others.  The music played upstairs when a DJ is not around is that of the videos mentioned in this place's name.  It's like a DJ is there with the videos playing.  Dance and remix is all you hear, huge plus.  \n\nThe deck, recently added onto, is a nice place to be able to go and take in the air.  Tables are at an appropriate level outside, enough to seat people, but also the right about for people to mingle.  The newer portion of the deck reminds you of sitting in a small garden with lighted seating.  The deck is also used in cooler weather as well with their drop-down curtains to keep the elements out and they heaters to keep the temperature comfortable.  Stools also line this bar as well.\n\nCash or credit and you can always start a tab.  I believe Tuesdays they now have a Bingo event available as well as a dart league.  Bartenders are always friendly and if you frequent enough remember your libation of choice.  One of the best bars to go to in Shadyside whether you are gay or straight.",3
"First, NO atmosphere.\n\nAfter working at the Clarendon for as long as I did, I recommended Fattoush quite a few times and never heard a bad word about it. But, honestly, I rarely stray further west than 15th avenue as general practice. Lucky for me, I was broke and at the will of my paying lunch partner, and he took me here (it's Ben from the Clar, FYI... here's proof that he's as into non-chain and local joints as most of us yelpers... and we drove there in his p-i-m-pin Prius... owoooo).\n\nWe had virtually the same thing and were both very pleased with it. The humus is very, very good. Incredibly smooth and flavorful.\n\nLentil soup also gets incredible thumbs up.",3
"If I could it would be 0 Stars. This place is the most horrific club ever in Vegas. Why is it in Vegas?! It's so unclean, ghetto, and a big no-no! Checked this place out this past week for the first time just because I wanted to try a new club in Vegas. I think i'll just stick to Marquee, Hakkasan and all the clubs that are considered to be Vegas clubs!",0
"Where to begin?!?!?  This is real Mexican street food here.  Hands down the best tacos I've ever had.  My boyfriend and I walk here for tacos as often as we possibly can.  At $2 each...  how can you resist?\n\nA few things...  these aren't your Old El Paso taco night with your mom tacos.  Do not expect hard shells, cheese, lettuce, sour cream, and black olives.    It's corn tortillas grilled and filled with the meat of your choice.  Depending on when you go those meat choices vary but there is almost always a basic steak taco meat and ribeye.  They also have chicken, pork (my favorite), barbacoa, a potato/pepper vegetarian option, and chorizo.  It's your job to top them with the salsas, tomatoes, onions, and avocado they have waiting.  \n\nWhen you're done at the taco stand, check out the grocery.  They have a huge selection of peppers and a butcher that rules.",4
"Food Review Only\n\nI thought this place was just ok. We did not eat anything the whole day so by 5 o'clock we just wanted to eat something. That and $5 happy hour sounded good.  We shared their happy hour appitizers and I ordered a pulled pork sandwich. Their appitizers tasted like appitizers you could find at Applebees, good but not spectacular. Their pulled pork sandwich was ok. The meat tasted good, but their sauce was too sweet for me. I like my sauce spicy.\n\nNext time I come here I would rather go to a show.\n\nZipzap Zubidy Bop!",2
"I echo the review below that the associates can make the visit truly memorable. I've had both sides of the coin. That said....guys, if you are looking for a fun date idea, something different...DO IT!!! Trust me...a great ice breaker+you pick your piece up a week later so hopefully a second date.\nDads of little girls...you too must do this too! Especially if you are a single dad. Get messy with your little princess+you'll have something she made on your shelf. (Chixfila before and Cold Stone after and you've got a whole afternoon planned)",4
Very flavorful Pho! Spring rolls were Awesome! Interior is super nice! Reasonable prices!,4
Free arcade games. Yes please! Games are older but those are the best ones I think . I really liked the pinball machine and wish they had another one. They have a pretty good selection of draft beer and $2 fireball shots on happy hour. Our server was friendly and enjoyable. The food was nothing to write home about but not bad. I like the small patio outside. Perfect for nice weather,4
"what a huge pile of disappointment this place is. how this restaurant has four stars is a serious mystery to me. \n\nmy fiance and i came here for dinner one night when we were both absolutely starving.  we would have thought almost anything was delicious at that point, and we were still totally let down. in order to accommodate our crazy hunger, we ordered a ton of food. we started with the house made charcuterie plate and couldn't find anything on it that we enjoyed.  i love pickled foods, but there was something about the flavor that really turned me off.  \n\nnext up was the creamy broccoli and brown ale soup.  this tasted like something you'd get at applebees or chili's and looked like it too.  it was so boring and generic-i figured the ale would give it an interesting flavor, but it just tasted like a bland bowl of whatever. \n\ni know we ordered at least three other things, but they were so whatever that i literally can't even remember what they were.  i was also disappointed to later find out they have a tot of the day (loooove tater tots), but our server never mentioned them. \n\ni can't see a reason to return to this restaurants unless it's for a cocktail only and i'm in the area.",1
Wow i do not even know where to start!! first off i would like to say i had one of the best steaks of my life the night BEFORE at SW steakhouse... then Saturday we came here. i will go as far as saying it was one of the worse meals of my life. the staff including the hostess was so rued when we arrived. second how does a place serving chicken parm and lasagna have a strict dress code. now i will go into the food\nwe kept it simple and started with the meatballs (3) they forgot to mention MINI meatballs they were the size of a quarter. THEY HAD ZERO TASTE WHAT SO EVER...\ni had the chicken parm for my entree it came out in a medal pan actually did not look that bad.. then i cut into it the chicken was very very thick and the cheese and sauce had no taste. after eating it i realized these dishes are 100% pre made. the side of spaghetti that was not included with the entree was so tiny and so mushy it could have passed as mashed potatoes. \nall 8 of us hated our food including the pasta with shrimp and lobster sauce and the lasagna. \nI'm not going to complain about the prices because we saw them before we went and i never mind paying money for a good meal.. BUT THIS PLACE IS NOTHING EVEN CLOSE TO A GOD MEAL.. STAY AWAY unless your from the Midwest and u do not know good Italian food this place is a no go. from the casino host himself i guarantee this place will be done within 6 months,0
"Desperate for something healthy in the area, I thought KFC might have some decent grilled chicken. They did not have grilled chicken off the bone, but had the grilled version on the bone. It was decent, maybe supermarket quality, but that is not what they are know for making best obviously. Cole slaw and biscuit do not need a review, but the staff is kinda dumb at this location. My two piece white meal ended up including a thigh and breast. I was in a rush and I would not have eaten the wing anyway, but I thought it was two piece white is two breasts. Oh well, i left my personal message on the table in protest in the form of overturned slaw cup, immature, but effective in teaching a non-verbal lesson.",1
"East Fremont has a great bar for beer and food!\n\nPark on Fremont is now open.  They call themselves a gastropub...and I get it.  They have a great selection of beer (pub) and they do an elevated bar food-meets-comfort food...so yeah, they're a gastropub...just not what I would typically think of when I think gastropub.  Everything on the menu is tweaked or twisted in some way to be more than just your run-of -the mill bar menu.\n\nPark on Fremont is the bar I always wanted to aesthetically design, but never knew  about.  Owned by the same group as the nearby Commonwealth, Park on Fremont is just plain cool on the inside.  Look around...stuffed birds behind the bar, a deer head with gold plated machine guns in its antlers, throwback trendy wallpaper, a beer garden that is way too cool for school!  Suffice it to say that you need to come down and check it out.  \n\nThere is not a lot of good food on East Fremont.  Park on Fremont is absolutely quality food!  I had the Philly Mac and Cheese Steak...yeah, a Philly Cheese steak with mac and cheese on top..I know why didn't you think of this before and make it?  Eat this.  I also tried the Chicken Bar Bites--Cornflake crusted pieces of real chicken with a trio of sauces...too large to be called nuggets...too small to be called fingers.  There were tasty.  I opted not to order the Fried Chicken and Waffle Sandwich.  I heard it was a little on the small side, but it sounded so good. Cap'n Crunch fired chicken with applewood, smoked bacon waffles and vanilla maple syrup...I will be eating you in the future...promise!\n\n...I almost forgot!...Sweet Potato Teeter Tots!...soo good! \n\nMy only qualm...and maybe I'm just spit-balling here...all the beers come in mason jars...cool I know...but are they the normal 16oz pour you are expecting?...I'm not up to date on my mason jar volumes, but they felt more like 14oz and I thought I would be getting a standard American Pint.  Maybe I did, but without some actual measuring I'll never know.\n\nCome here for good food while hopping the happening bars of East Fremont!\nCome here for a great beer selection!\nCome here for a beer garden that will make you swear you're not in Vegas!\nCome here for a different take on bar food!\nCome here for sippy, summer cocktails that will transport you poolside!\nCome here just to find the secret smoking area of the patio!\nRegardless of why...you should in fact come here!",3
"Yama Sushi - An AYCE restaurant approximately $25 a person. People give them 4 solid stars on yelp yet the service is fair so is the food. Their rolls are awesome and huge yet contains a large amount of rice which is their trick to make you feel full. However, I think the food worth the money because you can't complain about sushi. I personally give this restaurant 3.5/5 because service isn't what I expected.",2
"We walked in and were seated quickly. That was nice.\n\nFood was good. Pricey, but good. The edamame and fried tempura were absolutely amazing for a small appetizer before our sushi.\n\nThe sushi menu doesn't really have too much of a variety.\n\nAnd the music was just so loud that I couldn't enjoy my company's conversation.",2
"Clean and Modern Harris Teeter with a large hot food area.\n\nThey have great made to order sandwiches... the only problem is the line can get really long and moves slowly.  I try to go an hour or so after lunch.  I work in the area so I stop by here a lot for lunch and snacks.\n\nThe Harris Teeter Brand Bite-Size Cookies are awesome and cheap.\n\nWhat up with the \""SECURITY Section A\"".... \""SECURITY Section 9\"".  I assume there must be a lot of shop lifting but I've never noticed.\n\nAlso, they have a GREAT Pharmacy.  All the staff is very friendly; I've mostly dealt with Sarah and she is by far the best Pharmacist I've had here in Charlotte (very friendly and informative).  If you live in the neighborhood I highly recommend using them over CVS, Walgreens, Rite Aid.",3
"I filled out the form on their website, twice, for a free estimate. That was two months ago. I was never contacted. Thanks!",0
"If you want sandwiches and soup, the ingredients are extremely fresh, the portions are huge, and the prices are reasonable.  3 things you don't find together very often.\n\nWe sat on the outdoor patio because the weather was excellent.  I started with the spicy carrot-apple puree soup... something I was unsure about at first but it sounded better than the vegetable soup.  It turned out to be delicious.  I followed this up with the \""Pepper Island\"" sandwich, with pesto cream cheese, chicken salad, and chopped peppers (a replacement for the missing jalapeno jelly).  Trust me when I say that mere mortals do not need a full sandwich portion if you get soup.  A half portion should be plenty, and you will not hate yourself afterwards.\n\nWash it all down with one of their special soda floats.  I went with the maple-spice soda float.  I felt like I was drinking soda water that had been hypersaturated with maple sugar infused sugar and topped with a scoop of ice cream.  It was amazing.\n\n-1 star for generally slow, inattentive service.  Perfect if you want to laze about and study textbooks (which many were doing) but if you actually have a timetable it's kind of annoying.  The food is amazing here, so just come mentally prepared.",3
Its nice to finally get some new restaurants in QC. I enjoy coming here because everyone is friendly and the food is good. I like to get the veggie. My kids love getting the fire hats and they love the soda machine.,3
"2 stars for the quality of food and service. 3rd star is for the eye candy. Fortunately this location has a good talent selection.  Wings came out cold. Beer came out in plastic cups.. Then got warm.  Server had bad timing in coming back around.  In the end it was \""ok\"".",2
"Okay, I love Starbucks and am a gold card member.. But this location is my absolute least favorite.. Which totally stinks since it's the closest to my house. The drive thru wait is always forever long. They mess up my order more times than they get it right. I was just there, went inside, long line and they were not putting names on orders. This caused a cluster of drinks and confusion at the pickup window. I'm pretty sure I got the wrong drink and it tastes terrible. That or they messed up my order again. I'm making the switch to Grouchy Johns which is just as close. I'll save my Starbucks fix for the location by my work which is always on point.",0
"I actually went here yesterday. I have eaten here several times and have loves it. Yesterday we left wondering WTF happened. I wasted $40 on crap.... Literal crap. It started when I ordered. Asked for wings, were out of wings. Ok we can deal w that. Moved on to the next order. I'd like a side of green beans, oh we're out of them, ok mixed veggies, oh we're out of those too. Oh wow!!! Ok so we improvised and ordered different sides. I got fried fish that was chewy and fatty, my sons chicken strips smelled funny and had a bit of a rotten taste, my guy friends fried chicken was raw in the middle. I was annoyed. We didn't eat our food and I wasn't gonna sit there and cause a stink. I let them know directly about our problems and was offered another piece of chicken. Really? What you gave me already was inedible, why would I want more?? And another piece of chicken??? I spent $40 on stuff that went in the garbage can and a empty stomach. I WILL NEVER IN MY LIFE GO BACK TO THIS PLACE. N E V E R ! ! ! I want to know what happened. I used to love this spot. Now it nauseates me. I'm sad and pissed at the same time.",0
"I have been here several times and I absolutely love it. The food is amazing, the atmosphere is nice, and the service is consistently on point. I also LOVE that the majority of the food is local and organic. I had a girls night there this past weekend and we had a blast, the manager Mike came by and was super nice. My favorites here: mushroom burger, mushroom soup, kale Ceaser, the steak w/ chimichurri, short ribs, banana cream pie, chocolate cake and there is a lemon champagne cocktail that is delish!!",4
"My buddies and I just got back from Vegas and we stayed at THEhotel at Mandalay Bay. \n\nThe hotel and the rooms were pretty nice. Although, the smell in the lobby when you walk in from the garage wasn't too pleasant. But, the rooms itself were fine and we had a great view of the Strip from our room. The only problem I had with the room was looking out the window in the morning and being blinded by the sun coming off of the Luxor.\n\nWe hit up The Mix, which is the club at the top of THEhotel. That was pretty nice. We grabbed some cocktails before hand and went back up there later in the evening. You get an awesome view of the strip and it looks amazing at night. \n\nAs someone mentioned, it is quite a walk from THEhotel to the strip or to the tram that takes you to Excalibur and Luxor. I guess if you're stumbling in after a late night of partying, this can be a pain. The one thing I really enjoyed about THEhotel was the wave pool and beach that is part of this complex (over on the Mandalay side). It was nice to just chill and unwind in this pool on a 105+ day after a late night of partying. All in all, we had a good time.",3
fun place to hang out with friends during the weekend!\n\nhave yet to try the food,4
"Okay, this place has received a ton of slack from prior reviews. I am not a huge fan of the food nor the 1950's style decor, but the people are nice and I have been more than satisfied with the spinach queso dip. I actually do get a craving for it which draws me every few months to that bright turquoise and black decor. \nThe lunch menu is very reasonable and the lunch portion of the pollo magnifico was good! What this place lacks in food, is made up in quick, fairly friendly service, and an area that is convenient to downtown Scottsdale and the Giants Spring training stadium. I like the breezy patio area but the big black birds that stalk the fallen corn chips under your chair are a bit frightening. But after a game this March, I am actually looking forward to spinach dip and margarita at Julio G's.",1
"I do not understand how this place stays in business.  My comment has nothing to do with the location and everything to do with the food and the service.  I like to think that I am fairly open about assessing a new place, but the is not a Chinese restaurant.  The best thing that I can say about the entire experience is that it didn't taste bad -- there was NO flavor in anything .  Wow...really?  I can only think of the Allegory of the Cave when reading previous reviews and then to feel sorry if this is one of the best Chinese restaurants in Pittsburgh.  Really?!?!?\n\nAs I was walking here, I saw that their specialty was sichuan/szechuan and hunan styles of cooking.  I thought that was awesome since I prefer szechuan style cooking.  Don't believe what you read though.  The best approximation of the the taste and texture of this food is the cheap Cantonese dishes that I ordered in Hong Kong -- the difference is that I only paid 25 cents for three times as much food.  The food we ordered:\n\nPan fried pork dumplings\nWonton\nEgg drop\nCombo fried rice (yeung chow)\nKung Pao chicken\nUnsweet Tea\nCoke\n\nThe service was HORRIBLE.  The server only had THREE tables and she was running around like Foghorn Leghorn after Colonel Sanders chopped off his head in Family Guy.  What made it worse is that the owner/manager was watching the entire time and not interceding to try and make the experience better.  For your benefit, I will list the order of how my order arrived:\n\n1. Fried Rice (entree) - after 15 minutes of waiting\n2. Egg Drop Soup and Wonton Soup (appetizer) - 10 minutes after the fried rice\n3. Coke and Iced Tea (drinks) - 5 minutes after the soup.\n4. Kung Pao Chicken (entree) - 20 minutes after our drinks arrived.\n5. Dumplings (appetizer) - a good 10 minutes after the Kung Pao chicken.\n\nI am not going to bore you with the poor excuses uttered by the waitress, at least she appeared to be trying in the best way she could.  The fact that the manager/owner was just watching the entire situation just pissed me off.  I didn't finish eating anything.  If you enjoy eating coagulated goop in differing levels of solidity, then this is the place for you.  If you don't like Chinese food because it tastes like the food at this place, please try again in a different place -- this is NOT good Chinese food.\n\nThe most amazing part was the table of 5 Chinese men that were sitting at the table next to me.  They were continually asking for items that they were not recieving.  Two of the gentlemen actually went to speak to the manager -- IN CHINESE -- and the manager still did nothing.  Horrendous. At $20 per person, this is quite overpriced.  \n\nI shall never return.",0
"Wanna freeze your sweet ass in Vegas?  Well then try the \""Minus 5 Ice Lounge\"" in the Manadalay Bay hotel and casino.  I paid $30 for admission which included: a heavy coat, gloves, boots, and one drink.  They also provide a storage area for your stuff which they take from you once you enter the freezer, I mean lounge.  Unfortunately, they don't allow cameras, however, when I went to the ice bar in Stockholm, Sweden, I was able to take pictures and my camera didn't freeze.  Oh, there was a photographer who took your picture, but you pay for the photos you want and it wasn't included in the admission fee.  I was extremely cold after sitting on the ice benches for 10 minutes, so I didn't stay in longer than 20 minutes.  I suggest you wear long pants because the coats reach a little below your knee for most people and I noticed those that were wearing shorts (usual outdoor Vegas attire) were getting the shakes.  If you want to be bold, then get cold at the \""Minus 5 Ice Bar!\""",2
