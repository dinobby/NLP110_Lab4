"I've eaten here before and the food was great but this time was different. I ordered the 3 egg breakfast and had my eggs over medium. Everything tasted fine but when I went to break the last yoke, there was speckles of green. At first I thought it was pieces of chives but as I picked at it the green just bled into the yolk. I'm not saying it was mold, and from what I could taste it wasn't foul. \n\nBut what alarmed me was that when I told our waitress to take a look and just have the kitchen check their eggs in case it was mold to prevent a future complaint she just looked confused at me, didn't even look at my plate and said \""oh\"" and walked away. \n\nShe never apologized or looked at my plate to confirm the green. She didn't even take my plate away to show the kitchen. I took a photo of it before the bus boy took away my plate, which tells me she probably never told the kitchen either.",0
"Worst massage experience in the US.  In brief, I bought a Living Social deal for an 80 minute reflexology massage.  I checked the reviews and the website of the company first before buying and was expecting to have a massage from Mary.\n\nInstead, I received a massage from a guy who recently arrived from China.  My massage was not 80 minutes, it was about 65 minutes.  Unfortunately, I happened to open my eyes during the massage to find the man was picking his nose while massaging my feet.  He also burped loudly during the massage.  He used his nails when massaging my feet, and I have never had reflexology before so maybe it is normal, but I doubt it and it was very uncomfortable.\n\nOf course he asked me for a tip when he was done.  And to make it all worse, I told the girl at the front desk what happened, about the time, the nose picking, the burping, etc, and all she asked me was \""Is it okay?\"" and she told me that he was not going to be there much longer.  She did not offer any compensation even for the missing time.\n\nMy guess is they hired this guy just to massage the living social customers.  However, it is very bad for the company's reputation - I would not return- and when there is a problem I have very little respect for companies that do not set it right.",0
"Chad F's comment was a complete lie, I was the man In the chair and the manager, Ariel, and the whole staff was nothing but accommodating and beyond expectation. I would definitely recommend this place, they preform great cuts and a great experience.",4
"I have worked on a professional level with this company, and they are over flowing with integrity and the desire to get the job done correctly, not just to make a buck. As they are in my neighborhood I feel they are the logical choice for a local company, but regardless where you are located, this is an honest, capable, business partner that can take care of your flooring needs.",4
The opening and closing stop to either being happy or sad.  I think this airport needs a little remodeling and maybe a small expansion.. Kinda outdated. But everything is easy to maneuver through,2
"Two of our party ordered steak, which arrived cold, so it had been sitting for a while. Two people ordered fish, which reeked. My friend actually tasted the fish, which I would not do just based on the horrible smell that emanated from the fish. She said it had most certainly turned bad.  We could not imagine what chef would send out plates of fish which smelled as bad as they did.  The maitre d' came over and said it was a matter of opinion.  Our opinion is that you should not spend your hard earned money on any restaurant (especially one as expensive as this one) where they attempt to dispose of food that has gone bad by serving to their customers.",0
"Amazing!!! Got all 3 of the bureks - spinach, cheese and meat - love the meat! but all spectacular! Great people too!",4
"Tell you what, I am a pizza fan! If I could only eat one thing for the rest of my life it would be pizza! We went there for a work lunch and prices are kinda high, and pizza was kinda of dry.  There are better places out there...",1
"I have to say, this one is not a good sushi at all. this one is one of the worst sushi ever. Costco sushi even taste better than this. \nI'm sorry, I know that this place just open a week ago, but.. I can't say anything positive about the food.\nThe place used to be a fastfood restaurant (hawaian bbq) that is being converted into sushi join. but with No sushi bar (surprise).\nyes the place have a great service, friendly and bright. but I'm only rate based on quality of the food. yes I'm in phoenix, but still, there are some other decent place to eat. unless they fix on how they prepare the sushi. they'll not get any repeat customer.\nyes they gave me free ice-cream and other sashimi.",0
"Compared to other Hotels such as the Cosmopolitan in the area, this hotel rates poorly on all the following:\n\n+ Rooms: Dirty, old and dark - food found under the bed and toiletries remaining from the previous guest were found in the shower. Leading us to believe that the only thing that had been cleaned were the beds (or so we hoped). When addressing this with the staff they did nothing\n+Convenience: You will be charged a $200 room deposit that will take 5 - 7 business days to return. The Cosmopolitan is $150 and the funds are released immediately upon checkout. \n+Late Check Out: The latest you can check out is 12 pm, at the Cosmopolitan check out is 2 pm \n+Service: Staff will prioritize conversation among themselves vs. checking in guests. Check-in took 20 minutes with no one in line before us.\n\nWe were just there over labor day weekend and the hotel was slow compared to other hotels in the area. If you are looking for good guest service, nice rooms, and the convenience of a late check out given that you are in Vegas, do not book at Caesar's palace.",0
"Best moving experience you could ask for. Mitchell and Juan moved us and they were both so professional and courteous. Their prices are super fair too. I will definitely hire them again. Nothing they moved was damaged and only a couple wall nicks moving into the new home. It was astonishing how they didn't mess up the walls with some of the massive furniture I had! Corrine, at the front office, is fantastic. She made it super easy for me and she is so courteous and friendly.\n\nGood company!!! Highly recommend.",4
"I do about 95% of my shopping at Trader Joes, and I'm there every week. They have the best variety of organic produce and fresh fish. Plus, you can't beat their price of organic eggs, milk, and breads.",4
"If this is your first time to Jambo Park, parents be aware that majority of the attractions are for kids 12 and under. No need to waste your money and buy yourself a wristband. Only kids really need them: they are $15.99.\n\nI took my four year old daughter here because we got a Living Social deal: $15 for two unlimited wrist bands. \n\nFirst off, there are 4 types of rides. Flying elephants, rotating swings, train, and robotic animals. First off there are no ropes to distinguish where the lines start, so it is very chaotic and basically if you want your kid to ride the rides, you have to just let me run in when the gates open. My daughter loved all the rides, except for the robotic animals. Only one child can go at a time, which is a long wait and only one animal was operating so my daughter didn't even get to ride the animal she wanted to ride. \n\nThere were only 2 bowling lanes. It is very unorganized. The person operating at the time did not even know how to operate the lanes. My daughter and I were next and we stood in line for about 20 minutes until we were able to go. \n\nThe laser tag area was probably the best game. It was really fun, except only kids 5 and older were allowed. My daughter was tall so they let her play. \n\nThere's also a jungle gym area with a bouncy gym in the middle. There were lots of seats for parents to sit on and watch their kids. The only thing to remember is that your child has to have socks on in order to play. \n\nThe mini-golf area was super small. We only played a couple of holes, and stopped because my daughter got bored. \n\nThere were also arcade games, which we didn't play, but majority of the machines I noticed required at least 2 tokens. \n\nOverall, I wouldn't go again unless there was another Groupon or Living Social deal.",2
For some reason I never get a chance to eat before my flight home.   Thank goodness for Popeye's chicken inside the airport.  The food is always fresh and tasty.   The price is high as I don't know what..however so is everything else at the airport!,2
"So the question is; will you miss the chocolate chip cookie?\n\nWe've lived in other places and have really missed the Corner Bakery chain until we found one here.  Au Bon Pain is a close second in our book (east of the Mississippi).  But my question above is in reference to Paradise Bakery.  If Paradise didn't give out those cookies,would we still like them as much?  I think not.\n\nThe Corner Bakery gives good value for the money and I really believe they are more generous with the meat on their sandwiches.  CB excel at soups and salads, with interesting takes on some classics.  Our favorites soups are their Zesty Chicken Tortilla Soup, Roasted Tomato Basil and Mom's Chicken Noodle.  We also like their Southwest Avocado salad, Asian Edamame salad, and the Cavatappi Pasta salad.\n\nCorner Bakery also gives you some of their home made potato chips with your meal, which you might grow to like over a certain chocolate chip cookie.  LOL  Expect to pay around $8 or so for lunch, with a drink.\n\nEnjoy!",3
I want to give 5 stars but the food isn't that consistent. I usually love their daily chili specials. Nice outdoor seating.,3
"I highly recommend this restaurant. We walked by looking for lunch on a Monday and saw this beautiful outdoor seating area. Because we didn't have reservations, we sat inside but it was still nice. It seems many businesses host lunches there during the week. I would highly recommend making reservations.\n\nThe foie gras, warm salad (string bean salad) with shrimp, and red tuna steak were all very good.",3
"For the money.....great job! I don't know what I like more, the option to sub white rice with brown or the spa-like music playing at just the right level. The bamboo shades & slatted seats (however counter-service the place is otherwise) really made this eatery feel relaxing and soft and COOL on a warm day :)\nI wasn't sure what my taste buds really wanted that day. I played it safe and ordered something I could compare easily to other restaurants: Teriyaki chicken bowl was tasty & lite. I would have used a bit more sauce, but i tend to do that anyway, so maybe it was par for a good bowl presentation. They offer Bento box, some sushi, lots of veggie and fish options, and a kind approach to service with authentic smiles :)\n**Visit was 7/20/12",3
"I chose to go here because it was ranked the #1 steakhouse in all of Las Vegas, and I would have to agree with that ranking.\n\n\nOnce you arrive at the exterior of the restaurant, which is within the Paris hotel, you'll be greeted by a group of hostesses. They escort you to the door,  which from the outside appears to be a large glass/metal tube, but once the doors open, Gordon Ramsay's steakhouse is revealed. The decor is a lot of what you would expect when you think of Hell's Kitchen. It is black, red, dark and its wonderful. It has an extremely modern British feel, and it sets the perfect tone for a memorable night out to dinner. Not one single square inch of this restaurant went without some thought put into it. Above the restaurant hangs  an art piece, constructed of neon lights, depicting Gordon Ramsay's hand movement while making Beef Wellington.\n\n\n\nThe Food\n\nAfter greeting us, the waiter brought a food cart over with an assortment of all of the steak served at the restaurant. He gave us an option between a Hell's kitchen tasting menu which came with an autographed picture of Gordon Ramsay cooking, and he gave us a traditional menu. It was quite impressive. They even had Japanese Kobe available, however at $35 an ounce I had to pass. I elected to have the American Kobe filet, which was well marbleized and under $80.  Next the waiter let us hold and smell a white truffle, which is an option when ordering any Ramsey steak, but at $15 a gram and a three gram minimal order, I passed.\n\nI did op for the second best \""truffle\"" alternative which was macaroni and cheese cooked and white truffle oil, and it was absolutely scrumptious. When our steaks arrived, about 45 minutes after ordering, they were cooked to absolute perfection and I could not have asked for anything better. \n\nThe wait between ordering and receiving your food however is a tad bit long, but it gives you more time to soak it all in.\n\n\nIf you're looking for a great steak and a wonderful experience and perhaps a memory that will last a lifetime, I highly recommend Gordon Ramsay's Steak, located inside the Paris Hotel Las Vegas.",4
"I had the inca sandwich, the djaj and the vege and it was amazing!!! This place is too die for. I live 15-20 mins away and drive all the way there to just have a sandwich, it's that good!!! Try it out, it's a must.",4
"The staff here is mean. Not because they are Nazi's with their 'no camera' policy, no, that is understandable. They are mean because they are so very very unhappy.\nMy sweet boyfriend got us tickets to see Celine (AHH!) and we had seats in some kind of off area, and we were told to walk down the aisle to it- only to find this area has a bannister around it. So instead of walking back like jerks the way we came, we stepped over the knee high bannister and foudn our seats. Seconds later some staff rushes over and demands to see our tickets- cuz, you know, we are the jerks that make a huge display of walking down an aisle full of people to get to seats we think are empty and steal them. Ok, I guess I could forget that. But never, ever will forgive the ridiculous lady who did not let me back in.\nI wish I had gotten her name, because she's an ass. During intermission I went to the bathroom. I was then told that since Celine was ABOUT to perform (NOT ACTUALLY PERFORMING RIGHT THEN) I had to wait, since it was some 'really cool' special effect thing that if one door was opened, and light came it, it would ruin it all!\nSo I wait. I wait, and I see this skank let FIVE people in the door I was suppose to go into. FIVE FRICKEN PEOPLE. And she looks at me once, and looks away. The hell!? Oh, and to make it worse, when Celine is done, this mean lady says, \""NOW you can go in.\"" GAH",2
"I'm going to keep this short.\n\nThis place advertises itself as an \""Irish Pub\"" - being British I can categorically tell you this place is not a pub.  It's a restaurant.  It doesn't even have a proper bar area so the whole place is no smoking.\n\nMaybe the foods good, I wouldn't be able to tell you.  I left.",0
"Flavoriffic! Looking for tons of flavorful popcorn options? This is the place to go! Cheese, Salty, Sweet, or Mix, they have it all. \n\nMy Favorites: \nJalapeno Ranch - yum!",4
I went to get a fill  Monday and got the worst service ever! Nina was very mean and rude . She need to go back to nails school and learn how do some nails. This place needs a designer to come and redecorate the place. It is fill with junk yard crap! Anna and her nail tech needs to come and help run this place back to how it was before. This place never  have any  customer should have known.  By the way all the nail tech that use to work for Anna especially Grumpy Old  Man works down the street. Go see them!,0
"In sum, I very much enjoy this place. Hence the 4 stars. I probably order out from here 3-4 times a month. It is my 2nd most favorite Pho in Pittsburgh. I don't stray from my favorites dishes below, so I can't speak beyond what I will post. \n\nFor an appetizer, I order the Crispy Shrimp Rolls. Oh my! What little pieces of crispy, shrimp heaven. They are smaller shrimps, but the price is affordable so I don't mind. In my opinion what really drives this dish to excellence is the Vietnamese dipping sauce (nuoc cham). From what I learned about nuoc cham, every Vietnamese family has their own twist on it. The ingredients in nuoc cham are generally the same, but the proportions vary based on personal tastes and regions in Vietnam. According to Vietnamese cookbook author, Andrea Nguyen, \""as you move south the sauce gets sweeter, hotter, and more garlicky.\"" YUMMY!\n\nI thoroughly enjoy the Pho Meatball entree. I LOVE fresh herbs and spices. Pho rice noddles served along side crunchy and light bean sprouts. Fresh cilantro and basil. I consider myself a Pho Meatball amateur connoisseur of sorts. I only order this dish, no matter where I eat Pho at. I like the way they slice the meatballs at this establishment unlike other places. It makes it easier to grab with the chopsticks =) Also they have less grisley pieces in this meatball Pho. I've never dissected them, but assume it is part tripe. The flavor is moderate with the slightest hint of kick. Also the lemongrass in the soup broth is so amazing. It is the epitome of Vietnamese comfort foods in my opinion. Coupled with the addition of Sriracha chile sauce and Hoisin sauce they include on the side is amazing. \n\nThe staff are polite and quick. One never waits long for your food. It is a little disappointing that they open for dinner so late. It would be nice to grab something right when I get off work versus waiting for 5pm to roll around. However, I cannot deny that it is most definitely worth the wait! Oh and like others have said, they are NOT OPEN on TUESDAYS. Odd, I know.\n\nThere are two things to be mindful of 1. If you are dining in- your portion size of Pho will be larger. This is not just at this Vietnamese place it is pretty much the norm for the other Vietnamese places around the PGH area. 2. Cash only. This last one is a major pain to me. I am not the cash and carry type of person.",3
"I came here from Reno for a competition when I got here I thought the outside looked very nice. When you first walk on it looks okay. But after getting to the elevator and in the room is where it all went down hill. As soon as you open the door you get a smell like a bad apple car air freshener. Which made me instantly feel sick to my stomach. (The smell is lingering too. I've been in here for over two hours and it still smells awful) the room had two queen beds that looked a little bent up. My beds blanket had a nice little white stain on the top so I quickly found a cleaner lady and got a new one. Then after that was done I decided to connect to the wifi that we played $11 per night for and when it asked my to enter my last name and room number it told me that it couldn't be found! So I called the front desk and asked what was happening. They had no idea. So after dealing with that I just decided to go get some food. They have some nice food selections down on the casino floor (like subway, fat burger, Starbucks, ect.) which is nice. But for paying almost $500 for four days in this place it's really not worth it. It would be nicer and cheaper to just stay at a holiday inn.",0
"I usually get steak n eggs at south point late at night but we decided to try this place since their steak n eggs special is all day. For $5 you get a steak, hash browns, eggs, and toast. The steak was really thin so you're bound to finish it pretty fast. Everything was worth the price paid for but it could be a little better!\n\nThe service was pretty weird. I couldn't tell if  our server was being sarcastic or a total asshole.",2
Loved the atmosphere and they had a great selection of draft beers. But the food was just okay.,1
The Place is closed. Too bad - Although it is a monster chain restaurant - it was a nice chain.,0
"My husband and I have been coming here for at least fifteen years but I do have to agree with another poster, Derek B., as it has dramatically changed in mood and offerings what with all the new Latino vendors opening up shop. There are still several fine booths here---one in particular stands out that we frequent regularly. It's a store that sells discount lotions, creams , razor blades, etc. literally at half the price of CVS or WalMart and they are not old goods either. I buy my Advils here too as they are so reasonable. There is an older gal that has some beautifully knitted things but she needs to put the cigarettes down and away from her goods as I bought one item , a poncho, but stunk of smoke!  Had to wash it before I wore it. She sells baked goods too but I would stay away from them as no telling how long the shelf life of these cakes or how long they have been sitting around. You can see the entire place in two hours or less and the parking can be irritating, what with all the movement in and out. Also, the baby strollers are just everywhere!  I have had my feet run over a few times.",2
"Overpriced and not worth it!!!  I could have gone to in and out and had a better burger for 1/3 of the price. The guy who came around to the table to ask how everything was in flip flops, so unappetizing. The only thing good was the girls up at the front who took my order, they were friendly and knowledgable.",0
"AMAZING!  Love the laid back atmosphere.  The omelet was AMAZING.  Pick your 3 favorite fillers and enjoy!  I chose mushrooms, spinach, and avocado!  Lean mean and green!\nService was quick, friendly, and educated on all their dishes!",4
"On the recommendation of the previous reviewer, I booked an appointment with Autumn to fix a bad haircut I received the week before. I work about a block away from the salon, so the convenience (and the amazing price) was a big draw. \n\nThe salon is an odd mix of color, cozy, and sterile, but no matter: I wasn't there for the interior design. Happily, Autumn listened closely to why I wasn't happy with my previous cut, took careful note of the photos I brought in, and proceeded to fix the bad and design the good. She was extremely friendly, easy to chat with, and knew her stuff. I left the salon with a great new cut (exactly what I wanted, though a little short in order to fix the previous blunder), and a new hairdresser to boot. There's nothing quite like the relief of finding a stylist you know you can count on.",3
"Stayed here for the weekend. Last time I stayed here was twenty years ago. \nThis time the novel \""Inclinator\""ride was rough and rattling. \nIn my room the Curtain did not shut tighy so the morning sun ray woke me up earlier than I hoped for.\n\nMy bad but my miff is when I locked my self out of the room and had to wait thirty minutes for the security personnel to meet me in front of my room to let me in!  \n\nWhere there is so much competition as in Las Vegas,  this establishment needs some upgrade work to do.  Otherwise I will try a different hotel on my next trip to LV.",1
"Yikes!  I went to Bread and Butter with high expectations.  I'd read the reviews and was so hoping for the kind of great food and service that my fellow Yelpers described.  Unfortunately, I left disappointed and hungry.\n\nMy visit was during the lunch hour.  The lunch menu was, in my opinion, lackluster.  I told the gal at the counter I am vegan and asked what she'd recommend.   She said it would be no problem, and rattled off several things they could whip up.  I opted for the veggie sandwich, which sounded hardy and delicious.  What arrived was an egg sandwich.  I had to send it back, and when it returned it was mostly lettuce and tomato on some very thick wheat bread.  The bread was good, but the sandwich left me desiring more.  In addition, my sister in law ordered a sandwich with no condiments.  It arrived with some sort of dressing smeared on it, and she ended up taking it apart and just eating the innards.  I think the rest of the dishes were correct, but I don't recall anyone swooning over their food.\n\nI gave this place two stars instead of one because they were able to make a great soy latte!  I suspect their other coffee drinks are good too.  The pastry case looked a bit sparse, but what it did contain sure looked pretty.  Who knows if any of it was also tasty.\n\nI'm not sure if it's because there were five adults and two kids in our party, or if it was just an off day, but our experience left something to be desired.  Unfortunately, I won't be back.",1
"We were so happy to work with Yamilet and her team. She was very easy to talk to and listened to what we wanted for our wedding cake. We just told her about what our wedding was like and what colors and flowers we wanted to use and they made such a great cake! I didn't even expect to have all the detail work on it since we were just going to the base cake they offered through our venue. She added scroll work on the cake that matched my dress... too cool!  They made it look like we had an upgraded cake even though is was just a basic one.  Beautiful!\n\nThe taste was great too! Normally wedding cake is sort of bleh, but this was amazingly moist and very unique with the flavor combos we were able to do!  We got a cookies and cream cake with white and chocolate cake with cookies and cream filling and a cake with that had pear flavor in the filling.  Delicious!\n\nThe location is in China town in back of the strip where Pho Kim Long is (I don't know how else to describe it!)  You might be a little bite confused if you have to go there.  Their store front is kind of hard to find, you just have to look carefully.",3
"Terrible service, burger was burnt and tasted like charcoal, had a $9 cocktail that was undrinkable, employees seemed to hate their life's, and heard a fight almost break out in the kitchen. Definitely won't be coming back. The decor was pretty neat but the place is nothing but a run down pt's in disguise.",0
yuck. had to send a piece of sushi back because of a bug and should've known then to stop eating. tummy didn't feel so good the rest of the night.,0
"Great sports bar in the area with good food, service, and drafts. You are literally surrounded by TVs & can watch the game from every seat. The chipotle raspberry wings were really good, but the hot wings weren't all that impressive. Beef nachos were also good.",3
"I reallly don't like the cheap meat that is made so thin that they serve.  I only experienced the hamburger, and that surely wasn't impressive by any means.  Meh....not so good.  Not going back.",1
This is a great animal hospital. I would recommend it to anyone in search of a caring and capable Vet.\n\nMy dog (a Jindo) is 13 years old and somewhat crippled. I called Seven Hills and she was seen within an hour. She had two claws that were infected and needed to be removed. She needed to be sedated for the procedure.\n\nI was somewhat worried about the process but had complete faith in the Vet and his med techs.\n\nI carried her in to the hospital...but she walked out on her own and is on the mend.\n\nThis is definitely a place that has a capable staff and a caring attitude. I recommend it highly to anyone who expects a very high level medical experience for their pet.,4
"We were delighted with delicious food (Duck BLT blew our minds and our taste buds; winter meatballs were amazing) that was complemented by great drink pairings suggested by the amiable and helpful staff. The space is charming and comfortable, and after one visit, I rushed to make a Valentine's Day reservation (almost two months in advance).",4
"Another horrible experience, I'm providing 2 stars instead of 1 only due to the fact that I didn't hate the food. Food wasn't -- good, but it wasn't horrible either? Overpriced, rude staff, very stuck up. It appears that this place is staying open by default and location. Steer clear, make the drive further south to North. Better food, better parking, less attitude..",1
"I'm pretty sure this place is good for breakfast, but we went last minute with a couple of friend for dinner. It was OK, not awesome. I'll let them another chance for breakfast and will see what they have to offer. Apart from that, our waiter was very very nice.",2
"After checking out at the hotel me and my wife were staying at, I lingered around the front desk just glancing at the newspaper that was there while my wife grabbed some coffee and went in the gift shop. While standing there, I overheard a gentleman talking to the General Manager about his carpet cleaning company and how he could be of value to the property. I was impressed with what I heard so, after he was done, I told him I had overheard him speaking and was wondering if he did residential carpets as well. He said yes. I asked if he'd drive out to Ontario to do my house and he said yes, so we went over what I wanted done and he gave me a quote on the spot with no open ends. I must say, the guy was 7 minutes early so that was a huge plus. He was also very thorough with not only our tile in the kitchen and dining area but also our carpeting. There were a few pee spots on the family room carpet from the dog and, due to him being very meticulous, he was able to get them out. Another thing I'm used to with other carpet cleaners is the up-charge to remove \""tough\"" stains. Not this guy, he attacked them and did a great job and kept to his original estimate. The reason I will call this guy again, he called me aside and asked me if it was ok if he used a non-green chemical on my carpet to remove those pesky pee stains prior to spraying it down. That to me was huge. It showed he respected my home and well-being. I must say, we have our carpets and tile cleaned roughly every 4-6 months and our grout lines in the tile have never looked better. I was also very impressed that he left us with shoe covers at no charge. Very stand-up businessman and he's our guy from here on out. If only all home contractors could be like this guy.",4
Service was great.  Food on the other hand sucked really bad.  The only good thing was the shrimp appetizer.  I ordered a steak and my wife got a margarita and the nachos.  Kind of hard to mess up a steak but they did.  No flavor and if you like shoe leather I would recommend it but if you are like me pass on the steak.  Nachos were cold and the margarita was bland.  She had one in Nashville's margaritaville and loved it but the Vegas one was horrible.  We even said maybe it was a bad batch and went back to give it a second chance.  Same result.  There are much better places to go in Vegas to  eat.,1
"My first time eating here will more than likely be my last. Im big on customer service and i did not like the fact that when i got up to go use the rest room i returned just to have the rest of my food thrown away and after i asked the manager if i could get 5 shrimp like i had he said sorry my food got thrown away but it would be $2 per shrimp if i wanted more. I had just spent $30 there and that was totally wrong, that really put a sour taste in my mouth and i will not be a returning customer!",1
"Xiao long bao aka soup dumplings. I've followed these folks from 3 Village restaurant to 1900. They are offering the combo once again, soup dumplings steamed or fried with hot and sour soup or tofu soup for a dollar more. \n\nShanghai noodles are a must. They offer the jumbo soup dumplings, not bad but I'll stick with the usual.",3
"Booked Hotel online, I always wanted to stay here, (lived in Vegas for 8 years)..When I checked in they upgraded us to a huge corner suite, Excellent service, treated us like VIP's! \nSuite had Amazing views, windows all around, dual master bath--Very nice, Modern, super comfy bed, & AVEDA products! I Had friends/fam come visit, went to Ghost Bar & Playboy Club, Love the views, and the outside seating! \nPalms Pool is Amazing, They give you wristband's for Ditch Fridays--Crazy pool party, like a day club! Gets packed super fast, so get there as early as possible, more people than most night clubs! Had a Fabulous time--Gonna go again real soon!",4
"Our second time at Origin India, and it was as good, or better than the first time.  We had tandoori chicken for appetizer - the best tandoori chicken ever.  Not that dyed red stuff you get most places, but moist, tender flavorful dark meat chicken (our fav!)  We ordered papadums and it arrived with two dipping sauces which were fabulous.  The papadums were light and delicious.  We then had lamb shank, baked cod and sag paneer, all of which were terrific and 2 orders of garlic naan  (oh the naan!) to sop up all the delicious sauces and juices.  Our waiter, Ahmed (an Egyptian, actually) went out of his way to make sure we were happy, and we appreciated his attention to detail.\n\nThe decor is simple but tasteful.  This has become our favorite Indian restaurant.  The bartender is on UTube making a couple of the imaginative cocktails the restaurant serves.  We didn't have one, but my husband did have a Cilantro Mojito, different but delicious.  \n\nWe ate early (about 5:30) but by the time we left at 7:00 the restaurant was mostly full, with a couple of large parties as well.  Everyone seemed to be having a good time, and I know we did.\n\nBringing the check to the table with the machine to run your credit card is definitely different, but lets you have the confidence that there is no-one fooling with your card.  We like that little bit of safety!",3
"Artsy place with a cool vibe. My wife and I went there for a nice lunch and that is exactly what we got.  I really like the contrast of flavors that we had in our sandwiches. Mango, cajun chicken, and avocado --MMM!! Delicous!",3
"I've never been inside, but I've ordered a billion pizzas. They're all delicious. It can take a minute for delivery, but I've never been disappointed with a Caliente pizza, and that's all my rating needs to be. The missing star is to make room for whatever I might be missing about beer and the ambience inside -- sorry, guys.",3
"Oh Mojo you won my heart from day one... I always thought I was a gelato spot kinda guy but no apparently I can swing both ways. But if Mojo and Gelato Spot were in a heavyweight championship of how to retain best customers, Mojo has won round one. Why? Simply because of the awesomest event that runs every week on a Tuesday of which I love and that is Twitter Tuesdays! On this day and as an avid Mojo twitter follower, I am rewarded *that's what I think* for my fan-ship and loyalty with a fun secret word of which I made aware of the day of, and upon learning the secret word, drive after work to the Mill Ave location and get myself some Mojo fro-yo goodness for half-off! Score!! =) =) \n\nI just love that at this location there are 14 flavors available to sample, and mix and create the best combinations ever! Oh, and the many toppings and mix-ins make the experience enjoyable! Love getting myself a cup of lemon fro-yo with a tinge of strawberry fro-yo topped off with blueberries -delish- on and birthday cake with choc fro yo mixed in with almonds, peanuts, and choco pebbles... OMG! Yes... I love you Mojo... I am a fan!",3
"With so much anticipation my family expected so much with bacchanal buffet and we've been on quite a few buffet here in las vegas, nevada. we came around 5:30pm (after reading some recommendations from my yelpers out here to avoid \""hungry man delay\"") and it was perfect timing. we were on our table after 20 minutes of waiting on a Saturday dinner. not too shabby.\n\nDECOR: well lighted; huge comfortable seat; earthly colored carpeting; warm plates (super warm that it came with a hot plate holder). However, the only problem i had was the musical background...a bit noisy for my taste and from where i was sitting its a little loud adding up with my own family noise (having my 7 year old son there)\n\nSTATIONS/PRESENTATION: like we know there are seven stations. seafood; mexican; poultry; salad; italian; asian; dessert. each kitchen are presented with a clean elegant feel. plating of the foods are great and divided into small portions. all entree came with a name tag which is always good especially those with allergy. the only problem i had with the stations is that the kitchens are all scattered. one side has seafood ; poultry ; mexican then you walk on the left side of the room estimably like 100 steps then you get the salad ; italian ; asian while 100 steps from the right of seafood are your dessert. it gets quite far to reach left end to the right end. \n\nFOODS: overall taste is great. seafood kitchen offered quite a variety of clams, crab legs which seemed like regular crabs and another tray of the snow crabs, shrimp cocktail with marinara sauce or lemon, lobster chowder, corn on the cob, salmon with lemon zest sauce, baked halibut, shrimp with tomato sauce. at one point on this kitchen i had a glimpse of the sign that says \""for dietary preparation, ask the chef\"" and stupid me had to ask if he can serve the lobster on the glass but it turned out to be a display hehehe. next was poultry with the awesomest scallop ever (which is weird because of the kitchen \""poultry\"" maybe due to the potato IDK) presented on a cute little metal dish with glazed potato super yum! the rest i didn't really taste such as different cuts of fries, hush puppies, baked potato, baked chicken, roast beef, steak, ribs, pork, fried chicken...i got overwhelmed really. mexican kitchen didn't do anything for me so i skipped that as well as the salad and asian kitchen, maybe only trying the roast duck and i got grossed out since it was too lumpy and the day that i went, such area of the buffet really didnt sold out as the rest. italian was quite alright and my son had 3 slices of pepperoni pizza and as for myself i had pesto pasta with shrimp...lovely!...now on the dessert kitchen were i really got my money back with so much choices of baked pastries; a crepe station, ice cream station where i had the thai tea ice cream and strawberry and mochis which i end up eating like 10 pieces green tea and strawberry yummmmy!, baked souffl\u00e9 per request, macarons, sugar free items, chocolate mousse\n\nSERVICE: a little annoyed! our server failed to assist us with our drinks. at some point my husband rather stand up and do it himself with the refills...but thank god I'm with him. the plates were little late on the pick up and its just really slow. maybe like 20-30 mins before they refill us. and honestly after we left we had to buy out own bottled water to quench our thirst. bad\n\nPRICE: a little heavy on the budget at $50 each and my 7 year old son at $25\n\n***its quite an experience. although i had better buffet on the strip in the past. the taste at Wynn, Aria or Planet Hollywood is still the best for us.\n***maybe we have to re think if were ever going back here. long lines? poor drink refill? expensive? we'll see...",2
"As gyms go this one is ok.  What bugs me the most is the hidden fees.  There's an annual \""maintenance\"" fee of $29.99 they collect automatically in June.  When you sign up they collect the last month and first month and \""initiation fee\"", each at $10.00 for a total of $30.00 due at sign up.  If you cancel early (before your 1 yr contract automatically renews at $5.00 increase to $15.00/month), you will have to pay $25.00 \""processing fee\"".  And you can ONLY cancel within 60 days of your auto renewal date.  Discount = hidden fees.  Sick of being nickel and dimed to death.",2
"Disappointing.\n\nI was spoiled with the Rowland Heights (its in California) location growing up and the San Diego location. Both are clean and big stores with very nice offerings and plenty of fun prep foods like a take-out, bakeries and eateries outside the market. \n\nHere there's barely enough space to house this market. The aisles are barely good enough for carts to squeeze through and give a icky kinda feeling closed in among a mess. \n\nCleanliness- I can forgive a little smell afterall Asian markets have open fish market area and some Asian produce give off funky smells....this place reeks though! They definitely don't clean regularly/thoroughly enough to keep the smell at bay nor keep products neat and clean. Some of the fish and meat didn't look good. I wanted to do a fish fry but if they can't keep the store clean- I wonder what the fryers look like so I skipped out after browsing the store.  \n\nEven if there's some decent stuff here- this is very off putting to come if I can get it elsewhere.\n\nI even gave it another chance- came back other occasions earlier in the day thinking it might be in a better state, but I guess if it's dirty at night its because it was dirty to begin with. \n\nI'll go up the street to SF, 168/Diho, Greenland, International Market for my needs.",0
"When it comes to getting my nails done, I'm never that excited because it all seems like musical chairs.  I get a manicure done and the experience is usually so bad that I don't get another one done for months until I move onto the next generic salon.\n\nI first noticed this salon because of their d\u00e9cor.  It isn't fixed up like a zen garden, which is my usual experience with nail salons.  It's very modern with chandeliers and bright art.\n\nI went in without an appointment and was seen to pretty quickly.  I've gone to this place a few times now and seen two different nail technicians with equally amazing results.  Their staff is so friendly and very enthusiastic about their work.  They are constantly encouraging myself and my friend to push the envelope and do something to our nails that we wouldn't ordinarily do.  Additionally, their prices are very reasonable, especially when you factor in the upgrades you can get done that include hand painted art and accessories like swarovski crystals, glitter and studs.\n\nI've been searching for my standard salon for a while and can finally stop.  Highly recommend!",4
"Ok so I'll begin with the bad, cause baby- they ain't much good..... the drinks were not as strong as they should be for $14,(I had 3 of them and was not even buzzing- usually 2 and I ready to rumble) the sushi is great, but again you end up with $20 of it perperson just to have a decent sized dinner and the waitress totally but things on our bill that we didn't order AND the \""5 piece\"" tempura order originally came w 3 pieces. All of this and the 5 oz of  so-so sake was $15. They should be ad they are new to the valley b/c in this  market they'll be a one-off place to go for people who can vacation. Plus this was all on my birthday, so they needed to do better. Plus you pay $8 for valet and they didn,t even pull the car around all the way. Eahhhhhh \""at the the sushi was good?\"" Is not how I wanted to feel when the bill is over $120.",1
"Do NOT use Budget Car Rental at the Las Vegas Airport. In this electronic day and ago, you still have to wait in line to talk to a counter agent. I arrived at 1130pm on 1/16/2014 and I had to wait in line about 25 minutes before I could talk to a counter agent. I was at the counter for an additional 10 minutes before they finished punching my information into the computer.\n\nBudget Car Rental is way way horrible due to the wait times and the lack of automated kiosks. I would either recommend Alamo or National or Hertz because they have these automated kiosks and you will get your car in less than 5 minutes.",0
"The new Joint is great. Because of the layout and new sound it tops the Pearl for best mid sized venue.  The old Joint I loved the layout but the sound was awful!  The new Joint the sound is great, same great layout only larger. They even have reserved seats for the people that dont truly like the concert experience. To me a venue should be 90% or more  general admission otherwise its a total corporate experience and not built for true music and concert fans.  Great sounds, good promotion with Live Nation. Happy they got rid of Andrew Hewitt, he robs fans on ticket prices and the bands don't get any more money.  I only wish the Hard Rock would get a better parking garage for when concerts get out. That or  a larger valet area.",3
"Stopped in for some dessert and an after dinner drink with a large group. I liked what I had but take issue with the fact that he has an Italian spot in Vegas. I mean, come on, you are known for a crappy TV show that has an emphasis on desserts and you \""film\"" in Hoboken. I dont care if your grandmother cooked Italian...mine did too.\n\nThis place features fo-talian food with a of Carabbas feel. Hmmmm, I wonder where you got the idea? \n\nIn their defence though, their lobster tail pastry was delicious. Everything else was underwhelming. \n\nWill I be back? NO. Im tired of all these wannabe TV culinarians.",2
"The pharmacy at this location is horrible and they do not care about their customers. I recently dropped off a narcotic prescription at 10:45, I was told it would take 2 hours and to come back at 12:45. I came back at 1:20 to pick it up and was told that it was still not ready and to try coming back around 2:00. First, I think it is extremely unprofessional of the pharmacy to keep telling customers to come back later after they are given a time. If you are telling your customers that your prescription will be ready at such time, then it is your responsibility to make sure that happens. There has to be some semblance of order when putting together prescriptions. I use to be a pharmacy tech and I know that sometimes other people get pushed ahead of others. But continuously telling people to come back every 45 minutes to an hour and maybe your prescription will be done is completely off base and unfair to your customers. Fry's should train their pharmacy techs and pharmacists how to manage their time and how to actually tell time because it is obvious they only do what they want and not have any concern over their customers. Horrible pharmacy, try to go to Walgreens instead.",0
"Unbelievable. That's the best word I can use to sum up our experience at the Trump Hotel. And I don't mean it in a good way. We had such an unbelievably bad experience that I can't even begin to comprehend how things could have been this ridiculous. It was so terrible that we never even made it to a room and thus this review is based purely on our attempted check-in experience.\n\nWe arrived at the Trump around 12:45 a.m. on a Friday night. After sitting in two hours of barely moving traffic en route from San Diego, making our five hour drive a seven hour drive, we were exhausted. All I wanted was to relax in a nice, comfortable bed and regroup for the next day. Instead, we end up sitting in the lobby for not one, not two, but THREE hours! Here's the story:\n\nWe check in at 12:45 and the front desk says it will be 15 to 30 minutes until our room is ready. This in itself seems ridiculous. In a hotel with over a thousand rooms, how do they not have a single room ready for check in? Plus, we had booked our room in advance. Check in is around 4 p.m. It should have been ready hours ago! But we decide to take it all in stride and go to the bar for a drink. \n\nAn hour goes by. We go back to talk to the man at front desk. He apologizes and assures us that our room will be ready shortly. He says that we are fourth in line and the cleaner was in our room at the moment. He offers us $25 to use at the bar and an additional $50 on our room key once we receive it. He also says that he would upgrade our room to a suite at no charge.\n\nAt this point, it's closing in on 2 a.m. By the time we get to the bar, it was closing (didn't realize bars closed in Vegas) and the bartender offered us free beer for all the hassle. We continue to sit in the lobby, along with several other groups of people, and time continues to tick by. \n\nAround 3 a.m. we go to the front desk again. The line takes about 30 minutes, as there are already several complaints in front of ours. We finally find out that there was a \""situation\"" and our room is still not ready. They can't tell us what the \""situation\"" is or explain how a single \""situation\"" could cause us to wait for a room for three hours. We finally were offered a room at the Palazzo. The Trump arranged for a car to drive us to the hotel, which is a couple long Vegas blocks away. But before we could leave, we had to reclaim our baggage, which had been loaded on a cart to take to our room. When we asked for our baggage, the girl instead brought our car, which we were going to pick up the next day. \n\nEventually, after 4 a.m., we were dropped off at the Palazzo and were able to check in and be in bed by 4:30 a.m.\n\nI have no idea how a hotel can be so incredibly disorganized and deceitful. We didn't appreciate being lied to on several occasions about when our room would be ready and it was absolutely ridiculous how they didn't have a single room ready. \n\nNeedless to say, we won't be returning to the Trump Hotel.",0
"To start off, they got the order wrong.  You know that feeling when you stop somewhere because you're craving something?  UGH!  Not only did they get the order wrong, but it was with two things that were so hot that my stomach was burning by the time I finished.  Good, but hot.  The guacamole was watered down, the salsa was watered down, and the refried beans were watered down!  Saving money maybe?  The rice wasn't done the same as usual Robertos either.  Too salty.  I was really disappointed.  Skip this Roberto's and go to a different one.  Not worth it.",0
The cafe is old school Vegas coffee shop. Little smoky and dated but the food was yummy. I had the Hawaiian short ribs and OMG it was delish! Portion was huge. Can't wait to try the oxtail soup one night.,3
I have been a regular customer for years and aways happy! Something has changed as the quality of the laundry service is terrible! I have asked for a certain level of starch on my shirts (same as aways for years) but now it never comes back correct. Most of the time with little or no starch at all. I have asked that the manager call me to discuss so we can figure out the issue (I want to keep coming to this location) but after several promises and attempts to reach them I have had no response. The employees are always nice about this but I really want it to be fixed. Not sure how to get it done and have that great experience I am used to back again. May have new ownership or management? BEWARE!!!!!,0
so awesome coming here after bar like timeout or monkey pants closes.  I come from a place where there are NO 24 hour burrito places and to me this is stuff of legend.  \n\n$4 for a gigantic burrito.\n\nGet the Cali/Arizona burrito.  SO GOOD.  I cannot confirm or deny the cleanliness of the place.,2
"American Shooters is the nicest gun place in town with the best gun displays and beautiful firing ranges.  However, their guns are overpriced and the range fees are ridiculous.  I took some coworkers there to show off some of my toys.  Each person had to pay $35, just for range fees!  ($15 for pistol range, plus $20 for rifle range)  That is ridiculous!  Why doesn't $15 pay for both?  Because I'm stupid enough to pay for both?  Well, never again.  Why pay your exorbitant fee when we can shoot in the desert for free?  Moreover, their range rules are overly restrictive: you have to stay seated while firing on the rifle range & you can not shoot the head on your paper target because they are afraid that you will destroy their pulley system.  I like to take people here when we are just looking.  But, we go somewhere else when we are spending money.",1
"I've had great times at Pure.  I think it all depends on who you have bouncing in the front.  The first time I got in with no problem, no waiting and no cover charge on a busy night. We were all girls though. The second time it was just a hassle to get in.  We were suppoused to be on a list and we were told we werent.  They don't allow sneakers or so they say but there were several people with sneakers coming in and out of the club.  I will admit we werent over the top dress because we had just drivien six hours from Salt Lake City to come celebrate our friend's 21st bday. We were suppouse to surprise her but that got ruined with all the hassle we got.  My husband was wearing sneakers cause he forgot his at home from rushing so he hunted down some shoes.  Finally after an hour we got in.  They almost charged my husband cover charge but one of the bouncers was nice enough not to charge him since he showed his military id.  The drinks are expensive.  If you don't want to spend too much then get buzzed before you get there.",2

"The fountains at the Bellagio are so famous & rightly so. They were everything I hoped they would be & more. They are definitely an awesome free attraction & worth watching, and the fountain show takes place several times an hour in the evening.

Easy in and out. Can't really complain.,3
"My friend got another friend a groupon and we had a really good experience here. The receptionist was nice, the place is really cute and clean, and the ultrasound room was huge and cozy. I would definitely recommend this place if you want to have one of those ultrasounds as a keep sake. These things can be super expensive so the groupon was awesome.",4
"Would love to rate the food...but never got any (except for cold, crusty bread that seemed to have been soaked in olive oil).\n\nShowed up at 6:45 on Saturday night with a reservation. After ordering food and getting our drinks we never saw our waiter again except for a \""drive-by\"" (\""Everything OK here?\"" As he ran by without waiting for an answer.) After an hour with no food and no drinks past the first round I got up and went to the bar to pay for the drinks and left. While we were there we saw several waiter-less tables, including one with a dude who went to the bar to get a beer for himself since no one came his table to ask if he needed another drink.\n\nBased on other reviews, it appears Fran's never got their act together. There are WAY too many restaurants in Charlotte (and Dilworth) to put up with this. Terrible start to the weekend.\n\nTo paraphrase Keyshawn, \""COME ON, FRAN!\""\n\nWon't be back.",0

"I come here because the food is cheap and decent. I am a regular here. Tons of selections. The dishes aren't always consistent. It may taste good one day, and that same dish may taste different another day, but hey...its cheap.  A no-frills fast food restaurant for sure. It looks like a factory/school cafeteria inside. Sadly, there isn't that many quality turo-turo places around, so this what I will continue to eat. I like eating at Ito'y Sariling Atin in the same plaza to change up my routine.",2
"This is one of my two favorite coffeehouses in town. It took me far too long to come around and love Tazza D'oro. A horrible ex of mine loved this place and I admit that this soured me. I regret the time I wasted not going here. The dark wood inside comforts me. The small tables outside are a great place to spend the summer. \n\nTazza D'Oro brews Batdorf and Bronson beans (amazing), provides Enrico pastries (amazing) free wireless (amazing) and one of the most talented and friendly staffs I've ever met (amazing). Everyone who works there is *so* nice and *so* good at what they do. \n\nThey have a small menu of local/fresh food that looks amazing, but I have never actually eaten it. The espresso served here is actually better than the average shot served at Batdorf and Bronson locations in Olympia, WA. I talked about this with one of the barristas at TD'o and they were offended - \""we calibrate our machines the same, we use the same beans, the exact same blends and milks and everything, it can't be different.\"" Sorry, Tazza D'oro, you are better. \n\nThe lines get long on weekend mornings, but they move quickly. There's a sense of community nestled here, just off the \""main drag\"" of Highland Park, between Bryant st. and the reservoir. This is where you can pick up your CSA shipment for the week, where multiple weekly bike rides originate, where there are lively discussion groups meeting nearly every day. The percentage of students is low. Like the rest of Pittsburgh, there's a good chance you'll run into someone you know, but generally I see people I like and miss, which is different than the norm in Pittsburgh for me.",4
"The Wandering Horse is a really well done buffet that I have found to be consistently clean with an very good selection of fresh items and friendly if occasionally spotty table service. The buffet offers a standard blend of the tried and true steak, prime rib, salad bar combo with a nice blend of Mexican, Italian, Asian selections as well.\n\nI've eaten here at least 15 times since they opened, entertaining in-laws, business associates, and friends for lunch, dinner, and brunch having never left hungry or disappointed in anything save for the soups. Service has gotten consistently better and the food has stayed very consistently good. I would love to give five stars but on numerous occasions the soups have been under-seasoned and terribly bland.",3

"I just visited footcare massage for the first time with Amy. This is definitely a no frills massage spot but for $25 for an hour it was a good massage!  \nHere are some tips/warning:\n1. They do not do a pre-consultation, so if you have any areas you do not want them to massage you need to make sure you tell them. \n2,  Their massage technique is different than a relaxing gentle Swedish massage. They go at it, and they go at it hard. The technique is more aggressive and rapid paced. If you enjoy a deep muscle massage, then you will enjoy this inexpensive massage spot. \n3.  You leave your clothes on, and the rooms are semi private because you can hear the conversation in the next room. \n\nOverall this though give you a deep tissue massage at a great price. I enjoy a deep tissue massage, but I will not lie there were a few moments when this hurt. But not enough to prevent me from going again and recommending it.",3
"This company is not even worth 1 star.  It's a SCAM, they take your $$$$, make all these promises and then do not fulfill any of them.

"Coming from a girl who's first word was \""pizza\"" let me tell you this place left me speechless. \n\nWe ordered the \""Gnocco Fritto\"" with the \""Prosciutto di Parma\"" to start. The dough was fried perfectly and the fresh grated parmesan was the freshest I have ever tasted. Then ordered the \""Margherita D.O.C\"" which was topped with an amazing tomato sauce that was seasoned just right, bufala mozzarella and basil. That pizza alone was breathtaking, but the real winner here was the \""Pesto\"" pizza. Thin wood fired crust topped with ricotta, olive oil, and green pesto. When it arrived I admit it looked like the pesto was going to be overpowering and bitter, but boy was I wrong. I have never tasted such a balance of flavors in one bite. The medley of cheese and pesto was perfect. Was disappointed that I didn't get a chance to try the pasta because I'm sure it is amazing as well.\n\nIf you like REAL Italian food, I suggest you try this place.",4
"Yo & I is a lot better, cleaner and brighter. Reminds me of Yogurtland and has yogurt of the same quality for about the same prince methinks. The last few times I went here, the green tea was really disgusting and sour, and they don't even have outlets so I can do my homework and charge my laptop? How can a place promote wifi and have a single outlet, which is next to the trash can? Their yogurt is also of poor quality, too. I wish my frequent buyer card had more stamps at Yo & I than this place.",1
"I don't often venture in to thrift stores.  I had planned this visit looking for 2 particular items.  One I found on a visit to another store earlier in the day and the other a friend offered me one for free later in the day.  I couldn't resist wandering around though.  I beelined for the housewares section because kitchen stuff is one of the things I can get excited shopping for.  Was really unimpressed with the selection although it was late in the day of 50% off alternating Saturdays and I am sure it had been picked over.  Speaking of the sale day, the place was still packed in the early afternoon.  Just for the fun of it I wandered in to the men's clothing section not expecting much, they had some nice shirts but none that really excited me however I did find a pair of Tommy Bahama cargo shorts with some life left in them for $3.  I may have to visit thrift shops more often.",2
"One of the best I have tried!  I usually order the Gumbo, Etouffee and Manhattan Clam Chowder but everything is good there. The line speaks for itself! Good thing that its open 24-7 but expect to wait at least an hr or more during prime time. We usually go around 10am for lunch and 4pm for dinner to cut wait time. Depend if you would see this as a good thing or not, everyone can alternate waiting in line while the rest donates money to the machines and when your done eating and don't want to wait for the slow eater, go donate some more.\n\nService:\nIs wonderful 4/5 times which is understandable as these guys work their butts off. Regardless, they always try to put on a smile and still have a sense of humor with good spirit. \n\nAtmosphere:\nSince its a bar setting (well, obviously)  you know what your eating and how clean it is because they cook everything right in front of you.",4
"I visited Lon's last night for Restaurant Week with Kristin S. If you don't know where you are going, it is definitely a tricky place to find. It does add to the appeal because it gives the feeling of seclusion which would be appreciated if you were dining on the patio. We decided to sit inside because there was a wait for the patio, but it looked very relaxing and romantic with soft candlelight. The inside is large with many different dining rooms and the decor is all Southwestern. I'm not really into the Southwest as a decorating style, so it was a bit much for me.\n\nFor my starter, I had the cucumber, tomato and blue cheese salad...the tomatoes were very fresh and the blue cheese was a nice compliment and did not overpower the salad at all. I had the sea scallop entree. It was a very generous portion as the three scallops that came on the plate were really large. They were not the best scallops I have had (they didn't have that melt in your mouth quality), but they were cooked perfectly and were not gritty. The chocolate truffle tort was a perfectly sized as a dessert, but I didn't eat more than four bites of it because it was much much too rich for me.\n\nOur server Chris was very nice and provided good service. We did sit for awhile while they ran our credit cards, but we found out that was because their credit card machine broke. It would have been nice if they had come over and said it was taking awhile because of machine problems, but that's just a minor complaint. There is complimentary valet which was very quick and polite. Overall I enjoyed Lon's and would go back to sit on the patio and try the regular menu with my husband on a special occasion, like our anniversary.",3

"Elevate is the kind of place that I REALLY want to like.  It's not part of a chain and it's close to my home. I wanted to spend some time there and charge up my ipad at the same time.  I found a seat at a \""group\"" table and went up to order.  A crepe with banana and nuts sounded perfect with  my iced tea.  After I ordered I noticed that the prices were not specific \""crepes from 3-8 dollars.  Only after I had my receipt did I find out how much I paid.  \nI sat down and waited and waited and waited.  When I finally went up to the counter, about twenty minutes later it was apparent that they forgot my order.  I again told the person at the counter what my order was and about ten minutes later I received my crepe.  No apology, no explanation.  It was tasty, and the iced tea was nice.  But I feel that spending over ten bucks for a banana, crepe and iced tea was a rip off..",2
"Alchemy - Transforming simple ingredients into great meals\n\nThe dictionary defines alchemy as any magical power or process of transmuting a common substance, usually of little value, into a substance of great value.  That pretty much sums up how I felt about my recent lunch visit.   They transformed a group of simple ingredients (spare ribs, a roll, swiss cheese, some greens and mayo ) into a memorable dining experience that far exceeded my expectations from a bar and grill setting.  \n\nI visited Alchemy on a Sunday morning after a leisurely October bike ride.  As soon as I walked in I realized I used to frequent this location years ago when it did business as Wonder's Bar.  Frankly, not much has changed and that''s a good thing.  Back in the day, I was a fan of the elevated bar, all the rustic woodwork and lots of natural light and the new owners maintained all those features.  The tabletops were clean as were the floors.  The volume level  of the TV was a little too high for my liking, but most of the bar patrons were there to watch the Packer game, so that was expected.\n\nService was great as well.  Our server was energetic, friendly and knowledgeable about the menu.   The drink and food orders were delivered promptly and our server stayed on top of beverage refills.  \n\nI ordered one of the daily specials, the pulled spare rib sandwich.  It was a good concept that was well executed by the kitchen.  The tender spare ribs were moist without being greasy.   While I'm usually not a huge fan of tarragon, but I liked the hint of tarragon in the mayo. it worked well with the other ingredients.  The sandwich was topped with a handful of fresh watercress that added a nice textural contrast.  An the roll used for the sandwich was fresh and was in proper proportion to the fillings.\n\nThe sandwich came with a side of wasabi green beans which I thoroughly enjoyed.  I usually avoid green beans since they tend to be overcooked, but I appreciated the fact these beans had a little crunch to them.  The wasabi seeds were a nice accent to the dish.   I was expecting the wasabi to dominate the dish, but it did not.  \n\nI was a little disappointed in the much-hyped sweet potato fries.  I thought they were fried too long, so the natural sweetness of the potato was masked by a  bitter aftertaste.  Some of that bitterness was overcome by dipping the fried in the jalapeno - blackberry jam that accompanied this dish.  The tarragon mayo that worked so well with my sandwich did not work as well with the fries.  \n\nOverall, I was impressed with the food and service offered by Alchemy - definitely a step above the typical bar and grill experience.  I plan to return to try more of the menu items.",3
"This is one of those places you want to give negative stars to--that's really all you need to glean from this review. \n\nAre you a lady who hasn't had her fill of being talked down to or hit on by sleazy dudes today? Do you need an oil change but really can't be bothered to find out how much it will cost? Do you like overpaying for a carwash whose end result you could have paid $3 at Clean Freak to achieve? Well, sounds like you want to go to visit the total clowns at Danny's. \n\nI went here once about a year ago for an oil change and car wash. It took over an hour and I was really annoyed by the clumsy, gross flirting from the guy and that he forgot to give me the free car wash that came with it and how long it took them to give it to me when I pointed out that I was owed one. Don't make my mistake and go back because they happened to by close to your work and open when all other options were closed and you really need an oil change. \n\nFirst, I pulled up and waited five minutes for someone to make eye contact so I can figure out what bay to pull up to for an oil change. Seriously, if I'm not supposed to pull up to where the signs say OIL CHANGE to get one then get a sign to tell me where else to go to arrange this. Finally, I'm approached by some guy who stared at my cleavage the whole time he gave me the runaround of what costs what. Oh, you want me to pay $10 so that you CHECK--not act upon--the fluid levels in my car and check the tire pressure? Is this ridiculous upcharge only for ladies who you assume to be total dummies or are you an equal opportunity rip-off artist? \n\nAfter about five minutes of conversation, I still have no idea what an oil change costs there, only what extra fees they'd like to charge me for stuff that should be free and I'm pretty sure the employee doesn't either because he wants to be paid under the table. He told me he'd do a full service oil change if I just left $20 in the car. Like, don't exchange money with him out in the open, but leave it in the car, like he's an oil change hooker and I'm the john. I'm assuming your employer isn't keen on you not paying taxes, dude, but thanks for the offer?\n\nI never followed up with these guys to figure out why the employee would tell me that it's $31.95 if I pay inside and $20 if I pay him by just leaving money in the car because I'd rather just stay away from these guys. I got in the car and closed the door on the employee while he was still trying to give me the hard sell because he wouldn't take no for an answer, which is every woman's dream, isn't it?\n\nOh, and the car wash I got last year with the oil change sucked, too. There's nothing to make a girl feel more self conscious about her reliable yet boring Toyota like watching her car get ignored and left with water spots drying on it while all the guys working gather around to take pictures of themselves cleaning a Lamborghini.",0
"I came here on a Friday night just to hang out and kick off the weekend. We were seated at the bar because the restaurant was already closed (@ 9?!) and the bartenders were umm well not very attentive. Granted, we had drunk @$$holes sitting next to us, but I don't think that's a good enough reason to ignore me. When we FINALLY got to order (just chips and salsa, cuz the kitchen was closed!) we weren't sure if the order ever got put in by the bartender. When a confused guy came out of the kitchen with a plate of chips and salsa, I pounced on him, not sure if it was my order. It was, thank god. The salsa was decent but the beans which they provide with the chips were AMAZING!! Highly recommend!! We got kicked out like half an hour later, which I was not capable to drive yet. I was disappointed by the hours of this place, considering it's IN A CASINO!",2
One of my favorite bars of all time.  Bartenders are awesome and the crowd is def more of a local scene.  DJ's spin & bands rock on the regs plus they have events happening all the time too so usually each weekend is different.  Mad space makes it very cool even when its busy.,3
"I wish I could comment on the food here as I was really looking forward to eating at this restaurant. However, the owner was rude before I ever got the chance to order. I was wearing my work badge, and he immediately dismissed me as a solicitor, even upon asking for a menu. (Was trying to feed coworkers as well) He said, \""do you want a sandwich or not, I'm busy\"". I'll personally take mediocre food and great service vs a bitter old man and a great sandwich. Best of luck in business, and I wish even more luck to a patron on their lunch break. You'll need it.",0
Was all set to give a 4 or 5 star because the selection beats the hell out of anywhere else. And (at least in the computer section) they knew their stuff. BUT after buying all the computer parts and taking the option of having them build it for me 2 stars is all I can give. It's been over a week and I still haven't got my computer. Everytime I call they tell that they'll start having someone work on it ASAP. How are you not working on it already?! I have friends who have built their own comps and know it takes no more than an hour or two to do it. So there is no way they are THAT swamped with building other comps that they still haven't even started it a week later.,1
YUMMY!!!! Loved the place :) We ordered the Basil Eggplant w/beef and the Pad See Ew w/chicken both very  DELICIOUS cooked to perfection with fresh veggies. The Pad See Ew was the best we have ever had :) definitely a returning customer :) The owner was very nice and attentive to our needs. What I liked the most was that the food was not overly salted.,4
"The Italian Grotto is a stop I must always make when I am in Arizona.  This small Italian gem is hidden between all of the art galleries in downtown Scottsdale.  I have brought many family members here and not one has been disappointed.  Gary (the owner) is the Mark Cuban of the restaurant business.  He personally will check on every table to make sure that everything is going perfect (trust me, it is), and offers service and food that can only live up to his high standards.  The food is just amazing.  I have been there on numerous occasions and have yet to order anything but the Chicken Fontina. This dish includes a generous helping of chicken in a sweeter wine sauce that is perfectly countered with the saltiness of prosciutto.  I did try some of my dad's Manicotti last time and I have to say, the meat sauce is awesome.  One of the best meat sauces I have tasted from any Italian restaurant.  I have to say that the Italian Grotto is one of my favorite restaurants in Arizona, and a place where I can feel like I am part of the family thanks to Gary.",4
"I like Starbucks, I like the big green giant coffee house. My sister in law orders 2 Americana and the lady screws up the order and then said's to her, \""You ordered that!\"" with a attitude ... \""Hmmmm\"" I know customer service and the customer is always right. They also over charged her and owed her money, and she said, \""Well i have to call the manager to open the register. \"" Dang !!! go get manager and get the $. Must be a full moon ???? All i have to say is many Starbucks stay away from this one. Go to a Starbucks that has customer service. No Wifi, small and horrible service. I don't like writing bad reviews but i can't let go through this pain.",0
"LOVE, LOVE, LOVED this place! \n\nCame in with a large group all in town for a wedding, people were coming & going from our table and the server/other staff were all super accommodating to our needs. It was like a mini reunion of all us college friends and we could not have chosen a better spot.\n\nSince we had a large group it also allowed for me to try a little bit of everything, including the Pork Belly Pastrami (which the hus said was awesome), Burrata, Short Ribs, Sallops, Filet Mignon, Smoked Duck and my personal favorite Bernies Mac n' Cheese (which I went ahead and completely hogged).\n\nAbsolutely everything we tried was perfection. Definitely the best meal our entire stay in Scottsdale!",4
"Nothing special. Decor makes you expect more from the food.\n\nLooked like a charming place from the outside and the inside was inviting. The food was a letdown.\n\nHad the mussel app and for $10 it came with 12 PEI mussels in a decent broth. But they tasted bad like the previous review indicated. Eeeh.\n\nThe baked brie was nothing particularly inspired. The salads were ok.\n\nSandwiches came with a gratin of very thinly sliced potatoes with a cheese (asiago?). But it was not baked long enough and tasted somewhat raw. My daughters's wine braised beef sandwich was a mediocre and she didn't finish it, which is unusual for her.\n\nThe shaved turkey with cranberry chutney and smoked gouda sandwich was, however, extremely good. Three of use loved ours.\n\nI sent the coffee back as it tasted like instant and was, IMHO, undrinkable. The desserts were good, but small for the price. The pound cake with creme-de-cassis would have better with a good cup of coffee, but still was enjoyable.\n\nAll in all we spent $110 for 4 sandwiches, 4 small salads, 2 appetizers, and 3 desserts with water. And while Creme-de-cassis is one of my favorites, I think you can easily find a better meal nearby.",1
"Ever since my first visit seven months ago I've been meaning to get back here to order a different dinner from the menu & try to join the crowd, giving Poncho's 4-Stars.  Last time I had eaten a #11 Combo, & this time I had the #13.  Here was my impression this time:\n\nThe good:\n\nTons of atmosphere!\n\nFriendly service.\n\nA little bowl & a squeeze bottle of salsa for the chips, that gives you enough that you won't run out.  Nice!\n\nReasonable prices.\n\nGenerous servings.\n= = = = = = = = = = = = = = = \nThe not-so-good, in my opinion:\n\nThe poor menu!  The Combo choices miss many combinations.  They don't allow substitutions, & none of them added up to what I wanted, & would usually be able to get at a Mexican restaurant around town.\n\nMy #13 Combo came with an enchilada, tamale, taco (choice of shredded beef or chicken for each), & a tostada, attractively served, for $8.75.  Fine so far, but while the taco was ok, the rest of it was blah tasting (like the #11 last time).\n\nI'm sorry, I have to end up at 2-Stars here.  After all, if the food isn't very good, that's a biggie.",1
"Dr. Heard Vaughn was by far the worst doctor I have ever had. I regret using her through my entire pregnancy. She's very cold. My c-sectin was an absolute train wreck. I will give DR HV props for coming in on her day off to do it because, I demanded she did because, the on call was not any better. She complained my whole C section about missing a football game. I was on hospital bed rest with my first in Banner. Dr. HV never bothered to come see me in ante partum. My high risk doctor ended up demanding her to deliver me due to my preeclampsia. I do not recommend her to anyone. My second pregnancy I went into her office just for a blood test to confirm HCG for insurance and she had LAUGHED in my face and told me I am the worst pregnant prerson. I never returned. I had found an amazing doctor to take her place and I had the SAME problems my second pregnancy (Diabetes PRE E and HELPS) and my second doctor took such good care of us! My second daughter wasn't in the NICU either... She was delivered at 37 weeks like my first child. I strongly believe Dr. Vaughns terrible judgement and calls kept my child in way past a date that she was safe with what i had going on.... Don't walk away RUN!",0
"First time checking out the Adventuredome inside the Circus Circus, it was rather tricky finding it, and especially since I drove to the location and had to find parking (which is bad enough as it is). Personally didn't go on any of the rides because of costs, but I'm amazed how they could fit so many of them under one roof. Yes, it certainly does get very warm inside because of limited ventilation, and I would suggest you bring your own water and snacks, as the vendors' food prices (as is the case most of the time as amusement or popular attractions) were outrageous. And if I haven't mentioned it already, Adventuredome is literally a zoo, even on the weekdays!",2
"Other than diabetics or those prone to cavities, everyone should try this place at least once.\n\nFor the amount of alcohol per drink, the prices are very reasonable.  I've had a lot of fun here, though it's not really somewhere I like to stay all night (there are only so many of those syrupy drinks that you can handle, and this isn't really a place you come to just order a beer). Definitely a good choice for a fun stop on a girls' night out.",3
"I've been frequenting the String Bean for about 8 months now and it's time I proclaimed my love via Yelp: 5 STARS!\n\nEverything I've tried at this place is great - between the local menu, daily specials, and great beer selection (both bottled and on tap), this place has it all. Not to mention a beautiful outdoor seating area with outdoor fireplaces roaring in the fall and winter and live bands in the spring and summer.\n\nI live a good 30 minutes away but never mind making the drive to this place. Parking is a breeze, prices are a steal for the quality, and the staff is top notch in terms of friendliness and attentiveness.\n\nDo yourself (and your taste buds!) a favor and check out The String Bean with friends, a date, your parents or even solo ~ you're bound to make a friend or two at this place!",4
"Some of the food here is fantastic such as the Chicken Corfu $14.95 and others like the Gyro I found to be less than good becasue the meat was very dry some parts burnt with the obviously strong taste of fish.  I sent it back and they took it off our bill.  The remainder of the meal which consisted of the Corfu, salads and soup was great and our waitress; the owners daughter promised to address the Gyro with the kitchen.  This restaurant is located at the park in Fountain Hills with unobstructed views of the lake and fountain which erupts every hour spraying water more than 500 feet in the air.  We took a nice walk in the park after dinner which was very relaxing.  Recommended",3
"For some reason, I felt skeptical despite the good reviews here, but my brother (in from Los Angeles) wanted to go and since he'd picked such a great restaurant (The Capital Grille) the day before, I allowed it instead of following my gut.\n\nFirst, the place is butt ugly. I don't think anything has changed in their in 20 years and in this case, that is not a good thing. Tacky paintings. Bad lighting. Okay whatever.\n\nService was slow but I'm thinking maybe it's relaxing and not slow. My lemondrop was sour but it tasted of fresh lemon so that was okay. I had a craving for anchovies and asked to have them added to my salad. They brought me a big plate and that was nice because the salad was lacking in flavor, so the anchovy turned out to be helpful.\n\nSlowly on to the main course...I ordered an osso bucco that was supposed to be their house specialty. It's braised all day and served in a red wine reduction.\n\nBut while waiting for the food, I'm realizing that the heat is becoming stifling. I ask the waiter and he says the a/c has failed. (Uh, it's 105 degrees outside, if you have no air, maybe you need to shut down.) He asks about moving but since no one else at my table seems to be complaining and we've already had our salads, I say no. (I should have said yes.) They bring a fan out and it does help a bit.\n\nIt turns out the air was out in one dining room. There is a second dining room where it's on but I didn't understand that when he offered to move us. By the time I'm realizing something is seriously wrong, my whole table is griping about the heat.\n\nWe ate our meal in hot misery. At best, everyone's dish was mediocre. Mine was overly salty. The rigatoni tasted like homemade, but homemade by someone who wasn't a very good cook. My brother's pasta with shellfish was bland.\n\nThe heat is rising.\n\nI get up to use the restroom and complain about the heat. The guy doesn't know what I'm even talking about and points me to someone I assume is the manager.\n\nThe manager says, \""well, have you already eaten? Then what do you want me to do about it?\""\n\nHe's surly and confrontational. I don't know that I was looking to DO anything in particular, but I wanted to know why they had seated people in a room with no a/c when they had another dining room with functional a/c.\n\nManager, \""it went out. What are we going to do? Announce to everyone that it's out? No, we want you to enjoy your meal in peace.\""\n\nUh...\""enjoy meal\"" and no a/c in Las Vegas in July are two things that do not go together.\n\nI walked away from Mr Surly vowing to never go back.\n\nAt $30-35/entree, mediocre food, surly manager, no a/c, ugly (I mean butt ugly) decor, and apparently a near fist fight in the parking lot (I didn't see it...someone who was with us went out to smoke and saw it), I would not only never go back, but would tell you you'd be a fool to go.\n\nBah! The topper that made the worst taste in my mouth was really the manager. It's rare to encounter someone that nasty in a food service industry.\n\nOne of the all time worst meals I've ever had. If I could give it negative stars, I would.\n\nIf you want great Italian at a better price, go to Pasta Mia. If you want great Italian at a more expensive price, go to Valentino's.",0
"Sandwich wasn't that great. Pork has some tangy sauce like horseradish. Steak was ok, bland taste. Egg sandwich was good.",1
"If you are looking for a place to buy high quality pet food at very good prices then look no further, friendly staff, clean store.",4
"Place look like it had a cool menu. Stopped in for a drink and the bartender was such and arrogant pain that the single overpriced drink that our group had was ruined. There were not many people there and the bartender was far more concerned with chatting with the ladies there and when asked about menus and drinks was really \""put out\"". I think this place has a lot of potential to be good, it was just a terrible experience and we chose to take our business elsewhere.",1
"Ever since my boyfriend and I started watching Hell's Kitchen, Master Chef and Kitchen Nightmares, he's grown to have this undying love for Chef Gordon Ramsay.\n\nFor our trip to Vegas, he decided to book a reservation at Gordon Ramsay. I had a couple of qualms about this place before entering the facility. When my boyfriend made the reservation all he had to leave was a name, the hostess did not ask for a phone number. We pondered if we should call them back to leave a phone number so they could confirm the reservation with us day of, we decided not to. On the day of, my boyfriend called them to confirm the reservation. He said the girl sounded like they were making a new one for us and only replied with okay then hung up. After that he told me to call them back to confirm the reservation since it seemed like none of us were on the right page. I called back, told them the name under the reservation and then I was asked to hold. I held for 10 minutes before I decided to hang up. A restaurant boasting renowned Chef Gordon Ramsay's name should be much more organized than this I thought. If the reservations was screwed up for that night, I told myself I'd rip them a new one.\n\nLuckily, no new ones were ripped. The reservation was set already but the lack of communication was absurd. Ladies dressed in all black attire opened the vault like door to enter. We sat at the bar for a bit, I ordered a midori sour and my boyfriend got a coke and rum. After a couple minutes, we were notified that our seats were ready. I got a bit flustered because we were still trying to pay for our drink tab and the girl didn't bother to help us grab our drinks, with which I am not accustomed to. We got to our seat and our waiter came over quickly to give us water and show us a special prix fixe menu. He told us that the menu is a souvenir to take home at the end of the night should we choose to select it. We both rejected the offer and ended up getting the foie gras and beef wellington.\n\nThe foie gras was very delicious and enjoyable, the beef wellington... ehhh. Like I said, I already had some qualms that it was going to be disappointing. The pastry crust was nice but it tasted a bit off with the meat. After dinner, we got the melon panna cotta. I enjoyed the watermelon sorbet.\n\nOur server was very nice and explained all the different cuts of meat they had. It was a bit hard to hear him over the loud bang of music. Quite disappointing because I was really looking forward to the beef wellington.",2
"I was so excited to be in the neighborhood and drop in here. It's been a while since we've been there, but always loved it. Tonight, I walked in and caught the end of happy hour. Decided to order a glass of wine (excellent) and the garlic bread, since I thought my daughter would like it. The drinks came out quick...then...the \""rush\"" hit, and .the wait game begin. After seemingly like forever, our appetizer came out, but only not the garlic bread but the warm brie. I should have taken that as providence and kept it...but...didn't. Much later, the garlic bread came out. Honestly, it was so not worth the wait. it was for the most part totally unmemorable. It needed more garlic or some flavor. Waited. Waited. Waited. Finally our dinner came out. My pizza was just short of cold, on the luke warm side, so i'm guessing that it had been in the window for a while. My daughter's pizza was super steaming hot. She did the kids Hawaiian, and that was pretty tasty. Mine had a good taste, but cold pizza just wasn't overly appealing. Saw our waiter several times, but never seemed to be able to get his attention, so the wait game begin. I finally asked on of the other servers if i could get our bill. I'm really hoping that I caught them on an off-night. I love having something organic and gluten free, and I'm even willing to pay more for it. i just wish that the taste and service were like they were the last time I was there (believe was Buon Gusto then).",1
"Finally made it for dinner.  Thomas Keller fans rejoice.  Arrived around 9:30 pm, no wait at all.  Front of house staff were awesome, made us feel welcome like you were guests at someone's home.  Service was flawless.  Love the bread on the table.  Like right on the table  Salmon fans, try the Salmon rillette.  Amazing.  So good, my wife and I had to take our mothers the next night.  Also tried the Lamb, Sole, Steak Frites.  All good, but they had trouble cooking my steak at medium rare.  But because of the overall service and quality of food it is still a 5.  Will definitely be back.  Dont miss it!!",4
"I stayed in this \""hotel\"" on a cross country trip in late 2009. I'm just getting around to Yelping it now, but I doubt anything drastic has changed. \n\nMe and a buddy of mine were trying to travel very cheaply. We camped out as much as possible, but decided to splurge on the $40 hotel here in Tempe. We didn't have much of a choice as it hit 110 degrees during the day and was a cool 85 at night. My expectations for a hotel are fairly basic in my opinion:\n\n1. Clean enough to not find multiple bugs, have nasty smells, or stains anywhere.\n\n2. Have a bed.\n\n3. Have air conditioning (at least in Arizona in August)\n\nThe only thing that this Days Inn got right was having a bed in the room. But it wasn't even good enough to satisfy rule #1!!!\n\nThe receptionist wasn't very friendly when we checked in, but I could overlook this small feature. Again, it's not high on my list when I pay $40 for a room. After driving around to where our room was, it looked nice enough at first glance. We were just happy to have a place to get out of the furnace that was the outdoors. After getting inside, we crank the a/c full blast. Ahhhhh, finally some relief.... or so we thought. We waited for a while for it to cool down, but in the mean time all we could do was strip down to our underwear and just lie on the beds. But it never did start to cool down. It was just blowing some warm air. Strike #1.\n\nWaiting for it to turn night so we could actually move around without breaking a sweat, we were watching some tv and I noticed a few crickets jumping around on the comforter on the bed. WTF? Strike #2\n\nWe decided to go out later that night because we had heard the Tempe nightlife was pretty good. It was all going good until we called it a night and came back to the hotel. We wake up early in the morning to check out and the bathroom is completely infested with ants all over the sink. Crawling over our toothbrushes, the towels, up and down the walls, we had had enough. Strike #3\n\nI've never had problems with other Days Inn in the past, but I guess not every franchise has the same owners and rules. Definitely avoid this place like the plague.",0
"Like everybody else says, the Naked Pool at the Artisan Hotel is super chill. As locals we sneak away from work whenever we can on a Mon-Thu because the pool is open to anybody who wants to use it. First come/first served on the daybeds and cabanas - no charge. Topless sunbathing is allowed so that means no children. Towels are available for all guests. The bar is available in the lounge for drinks, but no food service on Mon or Tue and rest the week food doesn't start until 5:30. It's not a five star place like Mandalay, but the staff is friendly, and we just love the Artisan. They have big parties with DJs on the weekends so sometimes it's a little messy on Monday, but it's FREE so you can't complain. The music isn't super loud so you can socialize, have a conversation, and maybe make some new friends. Stop reading and come on out to the Naked Pool!",3
Worst bar in the N. Phoenix! Get rid of your regulars and maybe you will see some real business! You need to clean up too! The place smells like you have bar rot!!,0
"I lucked out and got a great Groupon deal for a deluxe pedicure for only $30(regular price is $65). \n\nI had Georgi as my tech, and she was very friendly, and VERY detailed when it came to the pedi. She did a great job getting rid of my \""winterized\"" feet, and a perfect polish. I tend to be picky, and I have no complaints with her service. \n\nAs far as the salon goes, it's okay. Really big, but nothing really blew me away.  I liked the pedicure, but it wasn't \""over the top\"" fantastic...and for $65 that's what I would like. I would go back with a gift certificate, or for an occasional treat.",3
"I am a boba tea enthusiast! This is the BEST place that I have found in the Phoenix area. The prices are about average and the tea was not too sweet. The boba is the best! I think it is the one made from taro root. However...the Asian market a couple doors down was sub-par, do your best to avoid it if possible.",4
"Great view, and pretty room. As it should be for the price. BUT, the room was not very clean. Extremely dusty! My allergies were terrible all night. They advertised a kitchen but the cupboards were bare. I've stayed all over the strip and was excited for Vdara, I am disappointed. On my way to the spa now, I hope it's better than the room.",1
We got two free buffets for the 51's hitting two home runs.  The wait staff was courteous and they always filled up are drinks and we never got a large stack of dish's on are table.  The food was not as impressive some of it was over cooked and under seasoned.  They had a decent amount of food for a lunch buffet but I would be disappointed if we where eating dinner.  It is a long drive for us to get to this buffet and probably won't return unless we receive it free again.,2
"Only stayed one night and picked it due to its location to the Pheonix airport -- had an early flight the next day\n\nI'll rate it for what it is... a 2 star hotel.  It's not claiming to be something its not.\n\nLocation is back in like an industrial/business/techie area - no pretty scenery here.  Pretty barebones hotel but it fit the bill for a place to sleep for the night and got a good deal on it through Hotwire.\n\nFlat screen TV in room had HBO and a fair amount of channels.\n\nRoom was clean enough.\n\nFront desk staff was very courteous and professional with a sense of humor. \n\nPool was on the small side, but we didnt go in.\n\nNo breakfast.  Just coffee in lobby, but we left before it was made so can't comment on that.  \n\nAll in all, would book again if I was just interested in a place to sleep before going to the airport.\n\nIf I were interested in actually spending time at the hotel, I would look elsewhere for something with more amenities, which would also come with a higher price tag, undoubtedly.\n\nKind of hard to rate it.... I mean, its a 2 star hotel... so 2 for that, and +1 for the friendly front desk people.",2
"Experienced better but what more can I ask for! I went here after gym and got the peanut paradise with soy protein. I can't complain because it was really good. I also ordered a chicken caesar wrap which was okay. \nSo you think that this place is healthy, ummm not at all. I went on their website at home to see how many calories was in the wrap and the protein shake I ordered, I immediately put the wrap in the refrigerator and only drank half of the smoothie. However, they do have shakes that are only 200 calories, which I usually get. \nThe only good thing about this place is it's across the street from CSN so if you want something quick and on the go. They also have all kinds of different smoothies to choose from. If your hungry they have wraps, salads, sandwiches, and they even serve breakfast.",2
"My family and I were visiting from California where a friend had mentioned a restaurant in Charlotte called Amalfi. We decided to spend the afternoon lunching there and enjoyed it thoroughly. Wonderful proprietors, fantastic food, great atmosphere. Try the Chicken Vino Bianco!",4
"I LOVE LOVE LOVE Paws Salon. I used to take my dog to Canine Preferred but the ladies at the front dest were flakey, so I thought I'd try a new place and I am SO glad I did. The owner Tracy clearly has a passion for animals. Walking in you are greeted by a cat, dog, and Macaw that call the front of the shop home. You are able to see them grooming the dogs (a big plus for me, you never know what some places do behind closed doors). She is very professional and seems like a no bullshit kind of lady (in a good way). She's to the point, tries to listen to exactly what you want and offers options and suggestions to help. They keep track of the previous cut that was given (it's annoying some places you to have to tell them every time). I would highly recommend this pet salon. They also offer daycare, and overnight boarding. I can't want to try the daycare to socialize my pup some more! Can't go wrong at this salon..",4
This place was ok. The prices were surprisingly affordable. I ordered from the $4 menu. Single steakburger with bacon. They serve plenty of fries with your burger as well. I didnt find anything great about the food but it is cheap. Also had the brownie with vanilla ice cream and the cookie with vanilla ice cream. The desserts were very good. The cookies and brownie were both very warm and soft.,2
I tried this cleaners after having a terrible experience with 215 cleaners across the street and I have not been disappointed. The prices are reasonable and they have next day service on the weekdays. The store is open on weekends for pick up and drop offs but they do not actually clean anything on Saturday or Sunday. The lady who owns the place is super nice and she always has some candy out for the customers (yum!). I will defintiley continue to use this cleaners as long as I live over here.,3
"Well, I finnaly got the chance to ceck this place out.  What a letdown.  Figured I would go basic and order a Chicao Dog and Fries.  Probably one of the worst chicao Dogs I have ever had and I did not like the oven baked fries at all.\nNo poppy bun as I was told they either did not get delivered or they were stolen.  That aside the brown crust was flaking off of the plain roll, like old bread does.  The roll had already started coming apart before I could pick it up.  Need less to say it quickly didintegrated as soon as I bit in.  The pickle was limp and broken.  This a small place that could do a good lunch business I suspect if quality was better.  Oneother note, mop the floor every night and when no one is at the register send the cashier out to wipe off tables...I mean really!\nI guess I will keep looking...",1
"Receiving a discount to this restaurant, like many other reviewers, was incentive to try it out. I took my boyfriend and neither of us thought it was all that great. The view is completely meh. The patio furniture is really cheap looking and should be updated. We didn't realize how expensive it was going to be until we were there (I mean until we read the prices because the environment doesn't scream fancy or over the top either), so we thought it would be really high quality food. not so much. Honestly my favorite thing was the housemade butter at the beginning with the bread they provide. It just seems like nothing about the restaurant is consistent with the higher prices. Even the wait staff wears polos and khaki pants, and things just seem kind of dirty...",1
"When you can get rasberries, strawberries or blueberries 2 for $1 you know you're getting a great deal. English cucumbers at the grocery store can run $1.99 each. At SSR market, usually 50 cents. Roma tomatoes for homemade salsa... 50 per pound. That was a few weeks ago. But every week, they have great deals on SOMETHING!! \n\nWith all the retirement communities around, the license plates are all represented here, and can occasionally be cause for frustration, thus the four stars. I usually visit during the week and avoid the overcrowding on weekends.",3
"Don't go to Pepin for the food, and I'm not saying that because of a lack of Spanish authenticity; it just doesn't taste good, ever ... usually.  This time wasn't bad and last time they didn't have my first three choices, not exaggerating.  But that doesn't explain the previous two visits.  Also, the prices are high, especially given my first comment.  If you can hurdle both of those comments, there are lots of reasons to go to Pepin.  You can order sangria by the liter, my wife keeps wanting to go, they have live flamenco dancing, my wife likes the good, the ambience feels Spanish, and they play upbeat flamenco music in the background.",1
"I really thought it was very average.  Wolfgang Puck is such an icon of great cuisine, but I'm just not impressed.  Partially my own fault.  I had one of the sides replaced with creamed spinach...  Which is supposed to be spinach with a little butter and cream.  Not butter and cream with a little spinach.  The food in general was so unnecessarily heavy, the creamed spinach was inedible.  The staff was very nice.",1
"10:30pm on a Saturday night. My friend and I try our second attempt at sushi for the night (see my review of Pearl for the first). Place is hopping. We take a seat at the sushi bar.\n\nThe Waitress:  \""Are you girls going to be ordering sushi?\""\nMe: I have a sushi menu in my hand, \""yes.\""\nWaitress:  \""Would you mind putting it in soon because they want to go home too.\""\nMe: What the fuck, bitch. \""Uh, ok\""\n\nDear Ra Waitress,\n\nI'm sorry if I kept you or any other employees, especially since I finished eating my roll before your kitchen even closed. It was completely ok to rush me, even though I had no intention of staying all fucking night and even though plenty of new sushi orders came after mine. I was hardly the last customer in there. There were people all around me ordering sushi, so I'm still unclear as to why you needed to rush me. If you were in such a hurry- why did it take you longer to bring and process my bill than it did for me to eat your food? Maybe it was because you don't know how to count, since you gave the wrong amount of change and I ended up having to tell you the correct amount since you couldn't count it on the spot. I like Ra for the atmosphere, something you completely ruined. Thanks for that.   \n\nSincerely,\nMorgan",0
"The line for Haze was looooooong so thank goodness for our concierge at Aria who was able to make some calls and bring our group to the front of the line and to get us all in free of charge (yes the guys too!).  Overall, this club is ok, but didn't have all the details of other Vegas clubs we've been to.  Also it was super crowded so I couldn't really bust a move, but had fun watching the hired contortionists!    Drinks were also a-ok...not too strong but the bartenders were able to get our orders pretty fast.  I'll only be back if I can get in without a wait and without making my husband pay to get in!",2
"I am not a fan. After my buzz was wearing off (really, who stays sober in Vegas?), my girls and I walked into O'Sheas hoping for some 99 cent frozen Baileys. I don't know how long we stood at the bar before Greg paid us any attention. The last time I checked, I wasn't invisible, so what gives, Greg?!? When he finally got over to us, I was already annoyed and just wanted my drink so I could bounce. Greg handed us half-full cups, which was not okay. If you're wondering why we stiffed you of your tip, Greg, wonder no more. You're the crappiest bartender I've ever met in my life.\n\nAlso, I don't see the appeal of playing beer pong here. Beer pong should only be played in garages at frat parties, in my opinion. And the go-go dancers at the casino were too reminiscent of a strip club. I bet it's hard for gamblers to concentrate while the girls are dancing on tables. I regret walking into this classless joint and degrading myself for a cheap drink. Btw, there's a Burger King inside O'Sheas. So d\u00e9class\u00e9.",0
"As a cow collector, the huge pink cow caught my attention, but aside from that, every other restaurant had a huge wait due to CES so we came here for dinner. \n\nFood: \nWe ordered a bunch of tapas to share and also to try different dishes. We ordered:\n\nfrench fries cooked in duck fat: the fries tasted good, but the texture \nthrew me off. It wasn't crispy as I expect them to be. Not sure if it's the way it's cooked or not, but I'll try it out again next time.\n\ncrispy pork belly bun: who doesn't love pork belly? very good!\n\ntenderloin roissini: very moist and was mixed with fois gras which made it even better!!\n\nmain lobster roll: wish we ordered more, it was delicious!\n\ntoscana with italian sausage: it was okay, but nothing special\n\nOur waiter suggested the artichoke dip which she claimed to be the best. I beg to differ. It was nothing special. The pita chips that came with it looked like it was from the bottom of the bag. \n\nOverall, the food was great, service was okay, but the ambiance was too loud for my taste. I left a little deaf.",2
"Olive Garden, ( or The OG as the nimrods call it) the food is a slap in the face to true Italians and foodies alike.  There are far better places in Las Vegas for traditional Italian food, you have to look outside the box and a chain restaurant is hardly the place to find great food. Olive Garden is just the Italian Denny's.  Try Roma Deli or Nora's Italian Cuisine for a true taste delight.",0
My sister and I came in for dinner on a whim last night. Our burgers were pretty tasty and our waiter - Justin  - was nice and helpful. We LOVE the dog loving theme. Well have to be back for another try and I know my coworkers will love it!,3
"Rudest. People. Ever. Not the employees - the customers!! I mean seriously, folks - shoving, slamming carts into e/o, cutting people off. Amazing. By the time I got back to my car, I was shaking. Jim almost had to pull me off of one lady - I was ready to take her down. Jesus, it's only a freakin' sample, get over yourself.\n\nNot that I would dock stars for the incredibly rude patrons. I'm still a little miffed that this is the second Costco I've gone to (after being sent by the first one) to get a product that they simply do not have. The stocker that we asked was kind enough to check for us (even though this took nearly 1/2 hour, while we waited in the isle being pushed and shoved by others with their brimming carts). Nearly an hour later, we left empty handed. Dread this place more than WalMart.",1
"Came here with a group of 6 early on a Friday afternoon, it was around 1pm and raining so the restaurant was nearly empty but the customer service was sooo bad.\n\nWe were seated at a table then waited around for approx 15minutes while the table next to us was served. The waitress didn't even make eye contact with us or say hello...doesn't make sense because I don't know how you miss a table of 6 people in a nearly empty restaurant. \n\nStill waiting around with no service we decided to go to the bar while my husband waited at the table. 3 of the 4 were able to get drinks while I waited around and got nothing. Yay me! \n\nHubby waited at the table and got nothing but irritable so needless to say we left and went straight to Pink's and tore it up.\n\nThanks Rock Bar, at least the drinks were good according to the people that got theirs.",0
"This was a unique dining experience.  The setting was subdued Irish pub. Dark polished wood, dim lighting, candlelight, and a variety of tables made this place inviting. The service was top-notch with the servers being knowledgeable of their items and making excellent suggestions.\n\nThe food. I had the Meat and Cheese Pasty. Homemade pork and sage sausage, swiss and cheddar cheese, in a wonderful pasty crust. It was so tasty. I also had some rich garlic mashed potatoes with cheese. It was a lot of food with half coming home with me. Saving room for dessert, I had the Apple Caramel Pasty. Melt in your mouth heaven. Cinnamon, apples, and caramel all melt in your mouth in a fluffy pasty crust. A delicious meal.",4
"This is our favorite family resturant. Food is great, service is always perfect and the atmosphere allows us to bring our children on a regular basis. Thanks John for making this our neighborhood restaurant.",4
"I met a few of the coworkers here for lunch, never having been here before.  I don't really frequent the brewhouse scene.\n\nWhen I asked the server what they had in the way of nonalcoholic beverages, she mentioned they have homemade root beer.  Of course I had to try that out.\n\nThe root beer is delicious.  I still have not obtained closure on the root beer mystery: it tastes virtually identical to Sonora Root Beer, which is Arizona's finest brew, and available at numerous local restaurants.  It appears as if SunUp formerly had (or still has?) some sort of partnership with Sonora Brewing Company, or if Sonora is even still a \""thing\""; I'm not sure if this means they now make the root beer, or what.  Whatever it is, the root beer is delicious.\n\nThe food?  It was, well, OK.  I went with the black and bleu burger, medium rare, with garlic parmesan fries.  I did like the fries, and the burger had a nice flavor.  The meat, however, was not the greatest (or the most plentiful), so I can't say this is a place you would go for a burger.\n\nThe menu in general is nothing special, although if I go back, I would try that smoked salmon reuben.  I think that is the only item on the menu that really struck me as unique.\n\nOverall, a decent restaurant, but nothing I would go out of my way for.",2
"Went on a night when there was some sort of day-glow party going on.  The go-go dancers were in neon tutus, afro wigs, stockings, and bras with a black light illuminating everything.  Most were pretty lazy until the crowd started arriving.  I guess they were preserving their energy for the night.  The club's \""hype man\"" was running around blowing a whistle dressed as Mario from Super Mario Brothers, which was hilarious.  I think there was a Luigi, too.  The atmosphere was great as well as the DJ.  The outdoor patio with the view of the city was also great.  We got there right when it opened and were the first to hit the dance floor.  After 30 minutes, the crowds arrived and the dance floor filled.  The party atmosphere was in full swing and was a great time all around.",3
"Okay, they almost got five stars! Everything went really well !! Even the paper thin walls, didn't even bother me ! Hearing the person next door snoring all night didn't even bother me!  I came here with my boyfriend and daughter. We stayed here because he coaches a Little league team, who were playing here in Henderson for a tournament. The whole team, plus family...were staying here...in this hotel.  \n\nThis is were they lost 4 stars.....Check out time is 11:00am (keep that in mind)!!!\n\nThe last day, we stay here. My daughter and I drop the boyfriend off at the park, that they were playing . At 9:00am! I come back to the hotel to get everything packed to go back to LOS Angeles, after the game! 10:45am rolls around and as I'm getting ready to get everything back in the car and tell my daughter to brush her teeth. I get a call from front desk. Guy says, \"" All the guest checked out and that means you have to Vacate the room too. IF you stay past 11am you will be charged an extra day\""!!!!  My phone says 10:45am!!!! WTF???? I seriously wouldn't have thought twice about this weird call, IFFFFFF this fool didn't talk to me,  like I was a piece of shit that needed to vacate this room immediately. After my boyfriend paid for the room and check out was 11 am.  \n\nUmmm....what does it have to do with us???? My boyfriend did not check out!!!!! His name was under the room!!!!!!!! What the hell does that have to do with me..????\n I technically still have 15 mins!!!!!! Is this how they tell their guest to vacate the room???? Why did the key still work???  \n\nI was sooooo freaking baffled, I just told him, \""okay\"".\n\nWhy did he call to tell me that i had to leave when the other guest checked out? BUT...then say if i stay past 11am I will be charged another day?????\n\nSounds like this hotel does not know professionalism whats so ever. Or the front desk people are stupid as hell and don't know how to tell time!!!  Either way THIS HOTEL FUCKED UP !!! NOT ONLY WILL I NOT COME HERE EVER AGAIN. BUT...AFTER THIS INCIDENT I TOLD ALLLL THE PARENTS ON THE BASEBALL TEAM AND THEY WERE IRATE WITH HOW THIS HOTEL, FOR NO DAMN REASON,  BECAUSE THE WAY THEY HANDLED THIS SO POORLY.  WILL NEVER STAY HERE AGAIN... \n\nOne star for the breakfast!!!!!  Stayed here 04/12-04/14",0
"My family has dined here since the late 70's when I was a kid growing up in Phoenix. It's a point of pride for locals, serving outstanding steaks, chops, etc. it has ALWAYS looked the same and I feel right at home in the Rat Pack \""themed\"" dining room. Enter & exit through the kitchen back door to see the busy, well-managed & friendly kitchen. This place is expensive, but the outstanding quality of food and superior service make for a fine experience. The restaurant is employee owned (at least it was... when Jack Durant died decades ago he left the restaurant to his employees along with $1 million to be divided up amongst them and rumor has it that some of the $ also went to his prized bulldogs, who are also honored by having their portraits displayed in the bar. For years & years the wait staff remained the same, and familiar to my family.)  They really put everything into their service. I sincerely hope you love it there as much as I do.",4
overpriced and poor quality food. the service was slow. We had an hour for and had to get to go boxes once they finally gave us our food. was never given a drink refill in the hour we were there.,0
"I've exp. better.\n\n Bread and butter is apparently not served at this restaurant, regardless of the pic on Yelp. The server must've had a big section b/c it took her FOREVER to serve us. The wait was about 10 minutes until she even showed up. She was nice throughout dinner when she showed up. The bus boy just stood around as the water glass sat empty. \n\nThey have an option where you can purchase 3 sides for $28 dollars, but neglect to list the price of sides solo. They are $9 each we found out although we ordered 3 sides. (the deal makes no sense mathmatically). I inquired if they were large enough to share and she said they weren't. That's odd b/c the cast iron pan of Mac and Chz could easily serve three people. Also, if you bring in your own cake its a $4 chg per person, which they waived. And they auto-grat parties of 6 or more. \n\nPrices are about $40 per entree and the Scottish Salmon and Prime Rib were delicious! The Mac and cheese wasn't anything to rave about.\n\nLooking back...the experience was worse than I thought.",1
"Very clean and organized! Every couple of weeks when I go I usually find a few good items that you wouldn't normally see for     $.99 and they keep it nice and and clean. I just bought a few plastic travel coffee cups with lids, my husband loves them and its so much better than paying up to $10 for one at other stores.",3
"i will never eat here again unless i get comped and i am desperate for sushi... \n\nway over priced... you kno i don't mind spending money on food, especially sushi, but this place has the smallest portions anywhere i kno.\n\ni ate at the bar, maybe i need to try table service but for now i hate it!",0
"When entering you have to figure out the way to front counter. I watched several people walk around due to how compact everything is here. The food is just as consistent with any other location and that was a plus. The tables are right on top of each other making it an uncomfortable dining experience. There is the smallest aisle to get to the front if you need to use the restroom, refill your drink or pick up your food. I also feel this place to be dirty. It is. Mom on to find peanut shells all over at Five Guys. The fountain drink area was a mess and there was ketchup and plent of other debris on the floor. This would be a place I would go for take out but wouldn't want to eat here again,",1
"After reading all the great review I decided to give it a try.  Thank you Yelpers for those honest reviews.  I was impressed and satisfied with my meal.  I had the beef and chicken Schwarma along with a Gyro, yes I was hungry.  Luckily I did order all that food as it was delicious.  Can't forget the baklava one of the best I have tasted.  It was crunchy as it should be and just sweet to the bite.  Great dinner that was well enjoyed by the family.",3
"This is a small park close to Red Rock Casino. They've got a big grassy area that's ideal for soccer or football or just hanging out. The kiddie area is smaller than many parks around town, as they only have one play area (most others have two). That play area has all the usual stuff: swings, slides, monkey bars... all sorts of stuff for kids to climb on. This isn't one of the parks in my regular rotation but makes for a good change of pace so my kid doesn't get too bored. The last time I was here it must have been \""father and kid day at the park.\"" There were probably six or seven other dads who had the same idea as me.\n\nThis park also makes for a good location to watch the fireworks over Red Rock during the fourth of July. Close enough to see them without having to deal with all the traffic at the casino.",2
Very disappointed! !!\nThe menu looks like 1200 people touch it all messy and oily! \nThe rice have been taste like they made it 2 days ago and they reheat it on the microwave! \nThe chicken carry was awful !\nYou can see in the photo all the pieces were  left  because 40% of it has bones and unknown rubbery chewy parts.\n\nEven the hot sauce was 50% blend with water come on!!!!!\n\n\nWILL NEVER GO BACK !!,0
"The only good that came from eating here was that the bill was comped.\n\nWent for dinner 22 April. Everything was fine up until the part where people actually eat, which is a major issue being a restaurant. Two distinctly different dishes were ordered; yellow curry with tofu and Seafood Delight. Hers came out in a reasonable amount of time. I told her to not wait for me and eat, believing my order would be coming out shortly.\n\nMeanwhile, a table of two came in, and was seated at a table that was in my line of sight. They got their drinks, ordered and started to eat\n\nEvery so often, staff would peek around to see me, sitting there not eating. Eventually, one of the waitresses comes over.\n\n\""Is everything okay?\nEverything except I haven't received my order.\""\n\nMinutes later...\n\n\""Is everything okay?\nIs there something wrong in the kitchen? I'm still waiting for my food.\""\n\nHer response was that the order slipped through the cracks because of a larger party's (20+) order, which doesn't sound right. The party she was talking about was already seated and eating when we walked in, and the table that was seated in my line of sight came in after us and was already eating. Additionally, our order was taken on one ticket, not two (2) separate orders, so both orders should have been started at the same time\n\nMy plate finally shows up, but I'm so upset that I don't eat. For five minutes, I debate whether or not to ask for the manager. And again, every so often the staff would peek around to see me, sitting there and not eating. Was finally persuaded to just eat so we can leave.\n\nWe had finished our meals. The male waiter shows up, and asks how things are going. She had asked for a to go container, which was brought promptly. She filled the container with her leftovers, and the dishes were taken away.\n\nWe sat around for another 15 minutes. No one bothered to ask if we were ready for our check. That table of two? Already out the door. While we were waiting, we had a talk about her talking with management, because I knew she would be calmer than I would be. We go to the front and had to ask the hostess we would like to pay, but we never received a bill.\n\n\""What table was yours?\nThe table that had to wait over fifteen minutes for my dinner.\""\n\nAt that point, I pulled $25 out of my pocket, and handed it to her while taking her take out container. Was so livid that I told the hostess that she had something to say to management and I had to leave\n\nShe finally came out, and I got the lowdown.\n\n- A lot of apologies were given, but no real action to correct the situation (Which I take as, no one cares enough to follow up)\n- Of the three wait staff (2 F, 1 M) who came to our table, not once did the male member mention he was the manager\n- Lots of finger pointing going around: waitress(es) believed since the manager came over, he would take care of us; manager believed waitress(es) was still serving us.",0
I really like the new Terminal 3 in this Las Vegas Airport.  Good restaurants/bars and the duty free shop has a great selection of booze and all sorts of stuff... so dont spend all your money at the casino!,3
Diya is amazing. A great little place! She was precise and gentle. Finally a great threader in Summerlin.,4
"We ate dinner here last night, and it was the last time I'll be \""taken\"" again. I'd expect better quality food from The Mirage, but I was wrong. There were minimal meat selections, turkey or prime rib -- with plenty of gristle included. Mashed potatoes were cold and seemed to be from a box. Most food had little flavor or were overly salty. The Asian area of the buffet lacked quality and flavor. The only desert that was good was the bread pudding and the fresh fruit. The other deserts had no flavor. The gelato was gross and melted before I returned to the table. Too expense for crap.",0
Homeology has a lot of great and interesting items. Ryan and Chris are great people. They are very friendly and knowledgeable about the different products that they sell. I really recommend this location.,4
"Only one word seems appropriate to describe this store: nightmare.\n\nYes, it is a complete shopping nightmare.\n\nI don't even know where to begin. This store in particular (at Chandler Fashion Center) is HUGE. Beyond enormous. It's so big, it has its own entrance/exit leading outside the mall. It's like four or five of the smaller clothing stores you'll find inside the mall put together. \n\nThis wouldn't be such a bad thing if this store had ANY form of organization, but it doesn't. Everything is set up in a completely random, nonsensical order, which makes trying to find anything specific a dizzying and frustrating experience. There are various \""rooms\"" throughout the store that all have their own set of shirts, dresses, pants, bottoms, purses, etc. The only items that are grouped together are jewelry and handbags, but even those can be found littered throughout the store. The store associates don't even know where to locate something, so don't bother asking unless you're feeling brave.\n\nTo further prove my point, I went into the store to exchange an item I had bought online that was too large. I was pointed to one room, where the cashier guessed the item might be. When I asked the salesperson if there were any other colors available for this item, she told me to go check another room... on the opposite side of the store. WTF?! Why are two items of the same style in different rooms? I think they just like to mess with their customers' heads.\n\nSo shopping here is nearly impossible and kind of exhausting. You basically have to browse the entire store to find things you like that might fit you. Everything runs small, like they're meant for small-framed girls. This is also why you will see plenty of 8-year-olds running around with gaudy fashion jewelry and handbags, swiping their parents' credit cards as they ring up the latest of F21's thousands of items.\n\nThat's another problem here - the store's inventory is changing CONSTANTLY. Sure, there's a great selection, but if you buy something that doesn't fit and come back a few weeks later, you might not be able to exchange it anymore because it's no longer there.\n\nOn the plus side, the clothes are cute (albeit cheaply made) and extremely affordable. But going into the store to shop isn't worth the experience. I've decided to stick to online shopping when it comes to this one. You will save yourself hours of frustration by doing the same.",1
"If I'm in the mood for AYCE sushi I go straight for YAMA SUSHI!! It has about the cheapest AYCE that I have seen (22.99$) and they other lots of different kinds of rolls, appetizers, and the sushi is FRESH :) The staff is also very friendly and attentive, which I really like in an AYCE place as I frequently want to order more and more and more.. AND they double check your order \n\nUnlike some other AYCE sushi places they offer hamachi kama (and salmon kama too!) this is one of my favorite dishes and it is certainly delicious ::drools:: I like to take the lemon from my water and spurt some citrousy goodness on it, but that's just me. The agedashi tofu its ehh, the batter around it is kind of rubbery and hard to eat after its been in the sauce for... well right when it was delivered. They might not offer as many appetizer as other AYCE places (Oyshi sushi) but they offer a different variety and it is tasty.\n\nThe sushi is very fresh and the cuts of fish are large. I LOVE the albacore, it melts in your mouth and it had just a dash of siracha. The yellowtail, garlic tuna and giant clam are also super yummy.\n\nThe ice cream is quite good as well! They offer red bean, green tea, and plum. They also have mochi :d\n\nIf you're thinking about getting AYCE sushi try this place out! The food will not disappoint. However, it is kind of crowded and usually busy so if you're not into that type of atmosphere be warned. They have one large room for big groups so if you have one they can accommodate you, but you'll probably need a reservation. Happy eating!!",4
"They lie to you! They tell you that you can bundle Direct TV with CenturyLink, get you to sign a 2 year contract. They get the Direct TV hooked up immediately, but nothing from CenturyLink. After getting jerked around for a couple of weeks they finally tell you that CenturyLink is not available in your area! They knew this all along and even try to blame CenturyLInk for not telling you! The owner won't return phone calls and pushes everything off to his uniformed secretary. HORRIBLE! The Direct TV works great, but get it anywhere else. I HATE being lied to!!!",0
"I was standing in front of the counter waiting. Another customer comes to the left of me and immediately gets his order taken.  The girl then puts up a sign to the left saying\""order here\"".  She could have just told me to move 3 feet to the left instead of ignoring me.  I left  and went to the place to the left and got my breakfast sandwich there.  She clearly saw me there before the other customer came over.",0
"Combination kabobs are excellent. Wonderful treatment of rice.  Definite value, with a nice atmosphere",3
"My favorite ayce sushi spot! They have a chain of them all have the same menu, all taste great! This one is just my favorite because it's the one I go to most often. Fish is fresh. Rice ratio is good. They have a great dessert menu. Most of time they are quick. Service is good. This should be your go-to spot!",4
"I had been to Rudy's on NM. It was not great, but OK. I decided to give the Chandler store a try. I had the moist brisket, and a jalapeno link. The brisket was mostly burnt to a crisp, and almost half was fat. I could not even chew through the link, and it was very greasy. The beans were plain. The white bread was stale. \n\nThis is a HIGH priced self service BBQ joint. Everything is by the pound at the counter. No wait staff. Plastic silverware, and butcher paper is all they have. I would call this low class. Yes it may be what some call traditional, but I like to have real plates and silverware.\n\nBack to the old standby Honeybears or Dave's",0
"Muffy, Buffy, Taffy and Kippy and I were recently at the mall. Suddenly the heavens sang and the Lacoste Boutique appeared. Wow. A whole store devoted to the gator. What could be better? Well....first of all...how about a selection with more than eight colors to choose from? And $80 a pop. Get real. Unless that gators gonna gnaw on my nipple while I'm wearing it, $80 is way too much.",2
My husband and I were married at Graceland Wedding Chapel 6/14/14 and we had the best experience ever! Rachel was so very helpful from the very beginning. She provided me with a great list of vendors and services to make our special day go smoothly. Our family and friends had such a great time. The dueling Elvis wedding package was worth every penny. Both were absolutely phenomenal. The photographer was awesome. We have such great pictures to share thanks to Abe.\nWe highly recommend Graceland Wedding Chapel for a wedding or vow renewal. We are already planning to be back for our 10 year anniversary for our vow renewal.\n\nThanks again for being so awesome!\nJaime and Mark,4
"I'm torn between how yummy the food is or how poor the service was. I came with a family of four and ordered the pot stickers appetizer coming with I believe 6 pieces? I also got the ck pad thai, the Kung pao ck, and yellow ck curry. But I waited a little longer than an hour and an half for my last dish!!!! Plus they brought our dishes two at a time so we all were eating at different times.. Such Ridiculous service.. We called out to the waitresses and waiters about 3-4 times yet none of them \""heard\"" us.. Another table also didn't receive water until 30 min after being seated! There is a lot of patience I have as a person but over an hour an a half for some \""wonderful\"" food. I cannot.. So! If you like Thai and don't mind waiting foreverrrrr then here is the place to go (: & if not? Make sure to have bunches and bunches of patience. (Btw. As a girl the only thing that frustrated me less? Was the hand scrubs in the BR. Lol.)",2
Dining review: CRAVE Downtown Summerlin\n\nFood was ok. Service....SUCKED. It was only 3pm and not busy. Waited approx 10 minutes to get seated basically since they were waiting for the new shift of staff to come in. Waited at our table for another 15-20 minutes for a server to arrive. We had plenty of time to figure out what we wanted so we did drink and food order at the same time. Drinks arrived (we only ordered water and never were given refills)....then waited well over 30 minutes for just a turkey burger and chicken stir fry to show up. We saw our server only 3 times in the hour we were there and had to almost tackle him to pay attention to us to get our tab. Manager walked around a lot and was on his cell. Not a good view when people are waiting for food or have that look like they need assistance but no one is showing up. We weren't the only table that seemed to be forgotten. Staffing needs some work and management could step up and help out more as well in my opinion. We probably won't be going back.\nTurkey burger was average and the chicken in the chicken stir fry was thinly sliced like it could of been used in a chicken sandwich or BLT style sandwich.,1
"My first time here ,Had the veggie wrap but didn't realized it really wrap with veggie,haha....I actually enjoyed it!! Had their green zing juice, it was kinda expensive for the size!!! It says large only ,  but its like a medium size cup!!!! I will go back to try other stuff on the menu though!!!",2
"Tim took care of me today.  Good experience, good hair cut and pleasant environment.",2
"No two ways about it, this is a classic old style diner.  It has been in existance since 1951.  I went on a Fri morning and they were crowded but I was able to get a seat at the counter.  I was told that it would have been much busier on a sat or sun.\n\nThere was some disagreement between two waitresses as who would take my order.  A few sharp words were spoken between them.\n\nFirst thing, the menu is a novel.  It takes too long to read it.  Places that concentrate on making a few items generally do a better job at it.  \n\nI didn't have to wait too long for my breakfast.  I ordered eggs benedict with a side of corned beef hash browns.  The eggs were cooked perfectly but the sauce was not a hollandaise and had no lemon flavor at all.  That detracted from the flavor.  \n\nOne thing to know ahead of time is that they only take cash.  No credit cards.  Apparently this is somewhat common in the Strip from what I was told.",3
"Been here a few times, and have loved it each time!  The space is nice and intimate!  The service is a little slow, but the food makes up for it!  I have tried the Chicken Oscar and loved it, as well with the prime rib that was very good.  You wouldnt expect a place like this inside the casino, but it is a very pleasant surprise!  If you are a member of restaurant.com you can get a discount i believe is $50 off $100 (tip included).... trust me, its worth it!",3
"One of the four Carnegie Museums in Pittsburgh, located across the street from Heinz Field. I've been here several times since I was younger, but today I went with my family to see BODIES...the Exhibition and Sportsworks exhibits, which are separate from the main building.  The Bodies exhibit seemed a bit overpriced at $22 (in addition to the general admission pricing if you plan on seeing the rest of the museum) and there is controversy surrounding the origins of the bodies on display, further evidenced by the 'origins of the specimens' handout given to you when you purchase tickets. However, I found the exhibit educational and it displays the intricacies of the human body in extraordinary way.\n\nSportsworks was fun, where else can you design your own roller coaster, and ride it? Along with playing mini golf, virtual snowboarding and hang gliding and other activities. \n\nThe main building has four floors of interactive activities, an aquarium, an IMAX theater, a hands-on kitchen area to learn about the science of cooking, miniature railroad and access to the USS Requin Submarine, and much more. Its not just for kids, although there will be lots of them.",3
"Sibling to Fountainbridge (and there are more to come I believe) it is similar in design.\n\nAll industrial exposed walls, etc and same ordering system in place - go order at counter and pay, get buzzer and when buzzer lights up then go collect food.\n\nSame menu including specials which change regularly. Experience is consistent - lovely staff, fab burgers (yep, includes GF) and fab fries also GF then I still love this place, no change there. Staff friendly, nice toilets and West End location is perfect for town. Love it! Best GF burger and fries in town :-)",4
"Stipulation: to get any more than 3 stars as a buffet, you need to blow my socks off.  They stayed on.\n\nThat said, it was enjoyable, and the items that I did choose were done rather well :-)\n\nGood points\n* Server was quick to fill up the champagne glasses.  Thank you!\n* Good coffee\n* Wonderful smoked salmon and cod\n* Nice cutlery\n* They make spicy tuna hand rolls to order\n* Shrimp was squishy\n\n\nNot so great\n* LONG wait (actually, the line moved quickly.  ~20 people once you got outside the twisty portion of the line (so, in front the casino floor), and it only took 45\"" and we were seated\n* horrible ice cream\n* desserts were \""eh\""\n* Sterile atmosphere. I know, you're in Vegas, but you're also at the Bellagio, and I was just hoping for a bit more\n* No crab or oysters :-(\n\nNo regrets; I would just choose to go a cafe next time.",2
"(Read this whole review...it ends with COCKROACHES!)\n\nLet me preface this review by saying that my husband are, in no way, picky when it comes to hotels.  We've stayed in hostels, hotels, apartments, etc...we're more concerned about price and location than amenities.  \n\nHowever, The Quad is the one place I can honestly say I will never, ever, EVER stay again.  Upon check-in, I didn't think it was that bad - sure the carpet is old and kind of funky, and the room (we had one that was \""remodeled\"") was pretty spartan, but we could handle it!  Since it was directly across the street from Caesar's Palace we were super pumped for our weekend in Vegas.\n\nHowever, the first night while climbing into bed, I noticed that we didn't even have a fitted sheet on the bed.  It was just another top sheet that was folded under the mattress.  Okay - that's forgivable...it's kind of nasty but I can deal. \n\nThen, the next morning I hop in the shower to get ready for the day.  Water pressure?  Hardly any.  It took a good 3 minutes just to rinse the shampoo out of my hair.  And THEN the water went ICE FRIGGIN COLD.  Never even went back to hot!  Just went from a nice warm temp to ice cubes for no reason.  I never did get any hot water again and my poor husband was forced to shower in freezing water.  This happened the next day as well....we were so upset!\n\nAnother gripe?  The elevator.  It was the slowest elevator I've ever been on.  Seriously, we waited around 5-10 minutes every single time just for the elevator to get on our floor.  When it finaly did arrive, there was such a huge line of people to get on that everyone stuffed themselves in there and then it was just a slow-moving sweatbox until you got to your desired floor.\n\nThe final straw, though, came as we checked out of the hotel.  We got in the cab and my husband turned to me and said he had a confession - on our first night he KILLED A FRIGGIN COCKROACH IN OUR ROOM.  He didn't want to tell me because I was so tired and he knew I wouldn't be able to sleep so he kept it to himself but he had to keep one eye open the entire time we spent at the hotel.\n\n\nJust absolutely DISGUSTING.  I hate this place, I will never stay there again, and the management should just burn the entire thing down.  Whoever thinks it is acceptable to run a hotel like this is a complete moron.  No matter how much more it costs, PLEASE do yourself a favor and stay anywhere else.  I am seriously so easy going when it comes to lodging and this was just the nastiest place.",0
"I am somewhat amused that there are renters and others who do not like living in a very secure and beautiful neighborhood. We have never had trouble getting vendors and friends through the gates - there is an easy on line app that allows you to give access. If you expect strangers to drive into the community to just waltz in - that isn't going to happen. That is why people moved here. If you don't like it - please look elsewhere. This is a great place if you value safety, great rec center, beautiful walk around the golf course views, and recently many community events.",4
I like they're work..however they made me wait at the nail table for a long time. Prob 30+ mins after they already started my nails...while multiple employees sat there talking to go do someone else's. I had a Mani pedi. They don't do gel nails just gel polish but charge way more for it. Also the designs are nice but expensive and you have to show them what you want exactly or you won't get what you're asking for. I probably won't go back after the poor customer service. The shop was not busy at the time either. Its only been 2 weeks and my nails are already grown out enough to get them redone. My toes were different colors than my fingers because they gave the job for someone else. It literally took 3 hours to get them done.,1
"Great owner and staff. Waiter was wonderful took the time to explain 'the numerous' specials. He knocked it out of the  park and recommended the Carne Adovada (one of their classics). Smoked pork simmered in green chile.  It was delicious, the best Mexican I have had in a very long time. Oh, and they have great drinks too. I will be back!",3
"Ordered their dinner deal, large one topping pizza with 25 wings for $20.95! Loved the deal, but the food was just okay. The wings were sauced perfect and had great heat (ordered the medium) and flavor, but the pizza was sub par. The dough was really tough and chewy like someone had kneaded it to death. The service was lacking, my husband asked about substituting the type of pizza we were ordering and the owner stepped in and gave this long winded explanation of why it was a bad idea... Next time a simple \""no, we can't substitute\"" would be more than enough.",2
"I have to say that this is the worst restaurant in Las Vegas which is saying something.  There was 6 of us and we all ordered off the dinner menu.  We even complained and the management only offered to give us something else.  What part of \""non-edible\"" didn't the manager understand.  The inability to finish our meals wasn't the last of it.  It was the revenge of Gilley's later that evening and into the next morning.  Some of us had Imodium to help others of us toughed it out.  If you are going to take your chances, don't get anything fried.  All of us who ordered the Country Fried Chicken and Southern Fried Catfish suffered the most.  But hey, it's Las Vegas so maybe take your chances.  You might have better luck.",0
"On the search for Shox for my fella, I scoured the earth trying to find the right pair for him. This store is smaller than the other outlets in town. Not as well stocked, but they still have quite a selection of clearance and sale items. Still not a large selection of what I was looking for and customer service was a little less friendly and attentive than other locations I've been to, but overall they're worth a shot for their clearance items alone.",2
Crappy store in a crappy run-down part of a crappy run-down area. This is one of the depressing parts of town where the junkies and hookers live.\n\nScratch that - even the hookers are probably too classy for this area.,1
"I have stayed here twice now - both times for one night only. I have to say - I AM A FAN! The rooms that I have had - one King Room and one suite were fantastic value for money and were clean and well decorated.\n\nThe casino floor is far from amazing, but I kind of like the old fashioned vibe that it has. It is run down in places, but when you consider the price paid for the value you get - AMAZING!\n\nIt would be a big shame to lose hotels like the Riviera. They give a reminder of the older Vegas and luckily a reminder of old Vegas room prices!\n\nLong live the Riviera!",3
"It's a cool little downtown bar, with a bit of a Portland or Seattle feel to it.  Dinky house, old dark wood finishings, neat art on the walls, and for the most part a fun, relaxed clientele.  Conversations with strangers just seem to flow here.\n\nDon't expect to find the exact drink you want, but there are plenty of great beers if you're flexible.  And yeah, skip it on First Friday.  Twice the people watching implies--by Newton's Fouth Law--four times the jostling.   That night had me thinking more frat party than alternative chillout.",3
Cheap and good a step up from Subway,2
"I was impressed with Paris, though I wasn't surprised by anything. In order to get the full experience for the hotel we were staying at, we spent a fair amount of time walking around and partaking in all of the things it had to offer. \n\nThe view from the top of the \""Eiffel Tower\"" was lovely, and a great way to start our night at Paris. \n\nWe ate at the steakhouse in the corner of the Casino, seated outdoor with views of the Bellagio fountains. Delightful drinks, great food. Another check!\n\nWe walked around the casino floor. Nothing to write Yelp about. \n\nThe room could have been transplanted from a Comfort Inn or Holiday Inn or something, and I wouldn't have known the difference. Granted, I didn't splurge for the nicest room, but didn't settle for the cheapest view. My middle of the road room was slightly below expectations, but maybe my expectations were too high. This isn't the newest, most modern hotel, and it suffered from some of Las Vegas' history. The room was a little smokey even though it was non-smoking, and looked well-worn. \n\nBut the bed was comfortable, and after countless hours walking the strip and casino floors, that's really all that matters. I would come back again with a great deal, but otherwise, try something else for the modern Vegas experience.",2
"My husband and I are huge mastro's fans! We have dined frequently at the Beverly Hills location and thought it would be a perfect date night on our last trip to Vegas to experience their Ocean Club. The location of this restaurant is in the crystals shopping center which is a little bit of a disappointment.  We dined in the tree house which was beautiful but the view of people shopping and the mall did take away from the ambiance, thus the four stars. I am a sweet wine type of girl and had the moscato, which was so smooth and sweet.   For an appetizer we ordered the scallops which were cooked to perfection and tasted amazing. For our entree my husband ordered the chicken and I ordered the bone-in rib eye.  The Ocean club is the sea food version of their traditionally restaurant but offers many of their beef variations.  Most of the appetizers are seafood options but they offer their regular sides with additional seafood options. The mac n cheese and garlic mashed potatoes were great as always.",3
"What a bad show! Bad production. Audio wasn't working for first 10 mins of the show, so not entertaining. I could see the \""magic\"" before it happened. The girls stepping into the box when they were not supposed to be seen. I would not recommend to waste your money.",0
"Thought I would put in my two cents for the Luxor, I was stayed here for a couple of weeks a few months ago for a computer convention show. Staying at the Luxor was most affordable given the location, time, and equipment I would be hauling. I would typically stay at the most affordable room I could find, in this case is the Pyramid Deluxe Room - and I found it to be quite spacious. During my stay, the rate is a bit easier on the wallet that the in golden clad hotel next door. \n\nI was staying on the 11th floor - with a view of the spire, city traffic, and in the background is the airport. It's a decent view. My other coworkers were expressing their displeasure of viewing another building, or some other inanimate object, so, I'm grateful for viewing a part of the city. \n\nIt's not too loud in the room - hardly hear anything, perfect for those periods of cramming out emails. Once the door is open though, the atmosphere of the building can be heard. I call that good attention to detail to actually insulate the door and door jamb to prevent the external acoustic energy from entering the room. \n\nThe lighting in the room could be better, as there was only one bright light  which was too focused by the window. I would've preferred an indirect flood light instead. \n\nThere's a decent flat screen in the room, and it's a good amount of room for two people to stay. In the main part of the Luxor is the Titanic Exhibit or Bodies, along with a pathway that takes you to a small mall and heading towards the Mandalay Bay. \n\nOverall, I found my experience to be decent and enjoyable. If the price is within budget again, I may pick this location again, for the next computer trade show.",2
"Looks like a standard vegas dim neighborhood bar. Only stopped in to pick up food but there were some bro looking guys hanging around and I saw some lifted trucks parked outside so I will definitely be back to drink. \nThe girls working were very kind and smiley and got me out of there quickly. \nI wasn't too happy with the turkey burger which was running dry. Four stars for their nachos alone! Chipotle chicken nachos are bomb. Massive portion of deliciously juicy chicken and all your nacho trimmings like pico de gallo and cheese. What makes these stand out is the sprinkle of cotija cheese, which has a sharp taste and is pretty much a mexican version of feta. \nOnly thing that I would suggest to make these better is to add more cotija, and to layer the toppings so you don't end up with a load of empty chips.",3
"There was a 15 minute wait for the outdoor seating, which I will say go for it! Who wants to spend a beautiful Sunday morning in dim lighting? Just go play the slots and maybe you'll end up paying with your winnings. :)\n\nCrab Cake Eggs Benedict was sensational. Best crab cake I've had, but a little on the thin side. $15.95\n\nThe Prime Rib with 3 Eggs was also tasty with a side of toast and hash browns. The complimentary jam is yum!!! Wanted to dip my fingers in and lick 'em. Which I sorta did, hehe! Only warning for this dish is the prime rib may come out more done than you wish. If you want medium, say medium-rare. $18.95\n\nGreat atmosphere, but can be a little hectic with waiters and busboys running around. Add in chairs and heaters in minimal space and you'll find yourself in a tight spot, literally. \n\nWish the fountains were on. \n\nFood wasn't piping hot. \n\nMIGHT try lunch or dinner.",2
"So, the prices are a little higher on most items in the store. The trade-off is that you can ask anyone who works here where to find something, and they will walk with you to the item's location. They'll also ask if they can help you look up some obscure part number for your sprinkler system. The girls working the registers are always friendly and helpful, too.\n\nIf you need a key made or some paint matched or something for your yard or a tool, Ace is so much more convenient and well organized than warehouse stores are and the service just wins.",4
"These guys wasted a lot of my time today. First, I called to check to see if they had a certain part. They said they did, I asked a follow up question, they went to double check and came back and said they had it. I drive there, they dont have it, haven't carried. We talk to the manager, David, he says oops sorry. He offers to special order it. We ask for a 10% discount, he says no. We tell him we will never go back and he says I understand and I am sorry but there is nothing I can do.",0
"*burp*  Cripes, this was some good food!  Pleasantly full, not like Thanksgiving.  I just HAD to have the #28 noodles.  Rice noodles, with mock pork, and egg roll on top, bean sprouts, lettuce, cucumbers and peanuts.  The bowl was HUGE!!!!!!!!!!!\nI went with Robert M. and Bacon and they had gotten there before me and had a couple appetizers ordered already.  Two different kinds of spring rolls: shrimp and pork.  This is a vegetarian restaurant, so all the meat was \""mock.\""  Each order had two huge rolls, enough food for the three of us to split.\nThe boys got the #41 - soy chicken speared with lemongrass and a tofu dish.  Everything was delicious!\nThen, the boba.  I've been a fan of boba forever and am soooooo glad there's a place in CenPho that has it!  Robert and I got the taro and coconut smoothies, with boba.  Bacon had the Chai with boba.  We also got to taste the avocado.  Soooooooo good, I will dream of it more than my last date.  That wasn't even worthy of a nightmare, it was so uneventful.\nThe owner was awesome and took his time to answer questions and explain the dishes and how to eat them.  Did you know that the Buddhist monks do not eat garlic or onions?  It's because they make you horny, and that's not good for monks.  Maybe I should cut those out of my diet, too.\nBoba.  The drink you can eat!",4
"Generally, I like BJ's,  however during our last visit our beers were warm, service was slow and when we said something to our server she didn't offer to correct any of the issues and we ended up leaving to get dessert elsewhere as we were aggravated with the experience.  Not the first time we have had issues with our servers here.",1
"DINNER: four stars\nthe only reason i would eat here is for the $50 per person fire pit! basically it's an all you can eat meat meal! pretty much this is the kind of thing you plan to go to in the morning for that evening. the trick is to starve yourself all day for all the de-lish meat you'll be consuming that night! my faves are the chicken wrapped in bacon and the tri-tip! YUM! \n \nthe overall service for dinner was on point. i never felt like i was wondering where my waiter was. this could have been in part to me asking him at the start of the meal to constantly keep a drink for my boyfriend and i on the table. i also asked him to never bring either of us the same drink and to only serve us his favorite drinks! :) \n\nas i remember it...\n1) i didn't walk out sober\n2) i was hella full from all the meat (which i could barley get through one round of all 12 or so meats!)\n3) this was no cheap endeavor (due in part to the alcohol requests! haha)\n\nTHE LOUNGE: three stars\nthe ambiance of the entire place is pretty cool. there is a wall that has running water which gives you the feeling of being in the tropics. there are girls dancing in cages and others swinging on trapezes from the ceiling. the service at the bar is pretty quick and the staff is friendly.  there's plenty of seating and plenty of room to dance. the music is pretty good, playing all your top hits. \n\nfor me, as i'm sure with many others, i'm not a huge fan of paying to get into bars, clubs or lounges. i typically plan on drinking, so i figure that's where you get to make your money off of me. i believe if you're staying at mandalay bay, you can get into the rumjungle for free. if you're not staying there, it's $25. \n\noverall, i would go to dinner there before i would go to the lounge. mostly because there are so many other clubs and lounges that have more to offer over the rumjungle. this is a great place for a large party who did dinner and followed with dancing the night away in the lounge.",2
"This review is for coffee and the pastries. \n\nI came in with Amelinda L. and Teresa S. last week after we had just grabbed dinner at View Wine Bar. After walking in, we were informed by one of the staff members that some of the pastries were 1/2 off. Great. As we took a closer look at the cakes and tarts at the counter, we were appalled to see a lot of not-so-hot looking little guys there. We're talking smudged frosting, and fruit that had been sitting out too long, i.e. strawberries that were shriveling and browning, plus a dried kiwi. Oh wait, no, it's just a kiwi slice that has seen better days.\n\nWhen looking at the pastries we asked a couple questions:\n\nUs: What is this pastry here? \nGuy: Uh...this is the caramel, and this is the strawberry, and I'm not sure (runs off to ask a coworker)\nGirl (who swoops in): That's a caramel, this is the strawberry chocolate, and that's the chocolate. It's my favorite!\n\nI love nondescriptive answers! Thanks for the enlightenment. Like I couldn't figure it out by the caramel drizzle, the strawberry sitting atop the second choice, and the chocolate garnish on the third. \n\nWorst of all, the conversation when ordering went like this:\n\nMe: I'd like two Nutella cappuccinos and the pumpkin latte - all medium size please.\nThe same guy as earlier: Um, what size do you want the latte?\nMe: A medium? \nGuy: OK\nMe: I'd also like the strawberry chocolate cake and the carrot cake.\nGuy: OK\nMe: How much are those?\n---Guy runs off to check, and at this time the girl in the front proceeds to tell me again that some of the pastries were 1/2 off---\n\nTerrible. Hot mess express. When I pointed out that some of the tarts were severly dried out to the girl, she said \""No, those are fine!\"" What a lie! Seriously, is this amateur hour? The two stars are for the barista..who seems to actually have a clue, since our drinks were totally on par. The rest of it though? No thank you.",1
"Ok....It's official I'm addicted to Firebirds!!!! And yes, they deserve all 5 stars!!!\n\nThe food and drinks are consistently good and I have yet to find something I didn't absolutely LOVE!\n\nTonight, my friends and I went out for dinner and drinks and we had a wonderful time!  I tried the Passion Punch and it was AMAZING...It's definitely a sweet and sour blend of SKYY Infusions ,All Natural Passion Fruit Vodka, St. Germain\n liqueur, fresh squeezed lime and fresh strawberry pieces. Would I like another?! Yes please! You will not regret it! It's very refreshing and delicious!\n\nFor Starters we tried the Lobster Spinach Queso-A spicy blend of lobster, baby spinach, tomatoes and pepper jack cheese with tri-colored tortilla chips. YUM!!! Nice large pieces of lobster mixed with spinach and the pepper jack cheese make this a great starter! It's wonderful! \n\nFor my meal, I had the sesame encrusted salmon which comes with ginger mustard aioli, Parmesan mashed potatoes, fried spinach. OK....where do I begin??? The aioli is too delicious for words....its so full of flavor and with the sesame crust on the salmon it offers such a great compliment to the fish. The Parmesan mashed are delicious as well, but that fried spinach is so unique! It literally melts in your mouth. Our waitress called them spinach chips....and that is so true! \n\nAll in all, this has become one of my new favorite places and I look forward to coming back again....VERY soon!",4
"I've had dinner at Toast! several times, but this is my first review of the restaurant.\n\nFirst impressions: from the outside, it looks like a hole in the wall, but step inside and you're in a cozy, warm environment.\n\nMy real gripe with this restaurant is that I've never felt the food is as good as it should be given the price. On a recent mid-week stop with friends, I ordered their pulled pork sandwich with a side of pickled vegetables (in lieu of the macaroni salad). When it arrived at the table, it looked underwhelming. Although the taste was ok, it tasted no different than something I could make at home with a little effort. The vegetables were tasty, but the portion was small. My friends seemed to enjoy their meals, but no one was raving about the quality. \n\nThe highlight of the evening was that bottles of wine were half off. Who-hoo! What a nice perk, right? We took full advantage of this and knocked back two bottles of red during our meal.\n\nA point off for food/presentation and another point off for service. It took too damn long to get the dessert menu in our hands.",2
"Best All-You-Can-Eat sushi in the city. And Kanda on Queen Mary proves that not all Kandas are the same. If you didn't enjoy a Kanda experience somewhere else, don't write Kanda Queen Mary off. If you enjoyed Kanda elsewhere, you'll love it at Queen Mary. Always fresh, always friendly service, and always fast. I always leave there happy and full, and for the price they charge, what more can you ask? Delicious.",4
"I love the fact that we have a farmer's market in Gilbert now, but unfortunately it's still very small...  There are only 2 vendors that sell veggies which I guess is the biggest surprise and disappointment, but I do love that the various other types of vendors seem to be growing.  Looking forward to seeing the market expand over time.",2
"The spinach salad and chicken picatta was amazing. Dessert was the Michael Chiarlo \""Nivole\"" Moscato.",3
Have been waiting in the check-in line for 20 plus minutes. Line is getting longer & service getting slower. Not the best way to welcome people to Vegas.,1
"Service is very hit and miss and when it misses it misses by a mile.  Waitress was not attentive at all.  Felt like we were forgotten.  Food is alright, nothing special.  The Phoenix area has many great Mexican restaurants and this isn't one of them.  Wouldn't come back because of the service.  The food isn't good enough make up for the bad service.",0
"All the appetizers were really good; however we found the entrees to be poorly executed.  Paella was way too salty, osso bucco was dry, but the short ribs were pretty good. \n\nAmbiance was intimate and service was good.\n\nI'll give it another try someday, but my first impression wasn't good enough to recommend this place.  Sorry.",2
"The problem with this buffet (when I ate there) is that fact that it wasn't busy enough to have the food be replenished. My wife and I attended at roughly 5:30 in the evening so im assuming it was before the dinner rush. \n    As a result of this, the majority of the food was either warm or cold. For some reason the heat lamps are not keeping the food hot. The food is also just plain low quality. There was a prime rib that came out fresh and hot and after I spent 10 seconds convincing the server that I wanted a piece of it, I finally got to try it. It was overcooked and tough.\n    Food sits out for too long, pasta becomes mushy, meats dry out, the seafood is flavorless and the whole place is overpriced at about $31.00 a plate. We had a cup of orange juice that tasted like soap; we believed the cup didn't get properly rinsed. \n    The sushi was also very disappointing; you know there's a problem when the placard simply says \""Assorted Sushi\"". Your better off eating at the buffet in Ceasers palace for lunch for roughly the same price. I've had dinner at Golden Corral for 12.99 that was overall better than this.",1
"Okay, if you're looking for good food around the Royal Mile, you're either drunk or mad. \n\nThere's really great food in Edinburgh, but none of it is anywhere near this place, which is a complete culinary disaster, in fact, Maxies has taken the concept of food failure to Olympic level. Okay, okay, so it's a fake pub style place just off one of the biggest tourist traps in the UK, but even then, at these prices you'd think you'd strike gold. But the stuff they're serving here is bad, beyond bad. Pre-plated and then microwaved meat (with microwave burn...), left to go cold, add some over boiled everyday veges and a lumpy packet sauce. Slap it on a plate, drop it in front of a punter and charge 15 quid. So THAT'S how you run a restaurant! Brilliant. \n\nSo bad I found myself craving airline food just to get the bitter taste out of my mouth...",0
"This place was a bit of a disappointment for me.  I was really excited to try it since I heard the chef was an apprentice of Iron Chef Mario Batali (yes, I love the Food network).\n\nThe service wasn't great, and even though it seemed fancy, the decor wasn't all that great either.\n\nThe food is expensive (which I was expecting), but the pasta that I got was pretty bad and for some reason tasted a lot like bacon (which I wasn't expecting).  Don't get me wrong, I love bacon, but not when it doesn't have bacon in it and isn't supposed to taste like that at all..\n\nI definitely wouldn't go back here, but it was an interesting experience.",1
"After waiting for hours to get a table, FINALLY!!!  I can't believe that I consumed so much sushi in an hour.\n\nThe fishes are fair, the service is sub-par, but the prices are really good.",1
"We eat here once a month or so.\n\nYes it's very busy, yes it's hard to provide 'great' service when it's busy.  But they do a good job still.\n\nGood food, good prices, we keep going back.",4
"I had dinner here about two weeks ago. First off, I am Mexican therefore I don't tend to eat Mexican food at restaurants, since I have high standards. But, I happened to be very hungry!\n\nSo I ordered the chips and salsa and the Enchiladas del Mar. The chips and salsa came out instantly and the salsa was surprisingly good. Not spicy, but not necessarily mild. It was perfect. I devoured the chips. \n\nNext, my order of enchiladas came out. They looked so good! I put a bit of the salsa from the chips on the enchiladas along with the black bean salsa that came with the entree. IT WAS AMAZING. My mom had never made any seafood enchiladas, therefore these were the best. The shrimp, scallops, and crab made an excellent combination. Craving them right now...\n\nNeedless to say, I enjoyed my dinner very much. I would definitely recommend the Enchiladas del Mar and the Chips and Salsa. Yum!",2
"The only reason we came here were for the all you can eat enchiladas. It was OK. When we arrived at the restaurant inside Santa Fe Station Casino, we were told it was a 15 minute wait even though there were plenty of empty tables. Our little buzzer didnt even alert us that our table was ready, someone just randomly came out from the other side of the restaurant and sat us. We got the chips and salsa and bean dip 5 minutes later which was delicious. Our waiter came to get our drink order at super fast speed and then disappeared for a while. It seems that EVERY time he came to our table, he was finding an excuse to leave our table--as if he was rushing to be somewhere else even though there was no one else in the restaurant except 2 people at the bar (it was a monday night). Maybe they were short staffed and he was the cook also?!?!? who knows because it wasnt explained. Anyway, the enchiladas were pretty good, they make you order a fountain drink as a condition of getting the all you can eat though. They bring out all three for the first course, beef, cheese and chicken. After that you order as you finish your current enchilada. They dont let you take it to go but they do let you take it home if you're too full. My husband ordered the chimichungas and he said they were really really good. I would go back again for the enchiladas, even though the service was very odd.",2
"Where do i even start? we where a group made up of two couples. we met someone who put us in a guest list. which we though was AWESOME! that was until we got there at 9:15pm and it took us over one and a half hours to get threw the guest list line... and the bouncers where total douche bags, Sorry your 40 years old and taking names at a club in Vegas! old pervs. we are customers. our money goes into YOUR pocket at the end of the night! anyways. once we got in it was SO Packed! we couldn't get on the dance floor at all! they where blocking it off!  we get to the fist bar outside, and order four shots, 3 Patron, 1 Goose, Chilled. expensive, but expected, so it was okay. we go inside to order another round of shots a little later in the bar that was kinda inside/ almost outside.  We order the same shots. 3 Patron, 1 Goose. Chilled. the guy pours 3 goose, one patron. so i asked which one Goose. he said\"" ill let you guess\"" i said you poured 3 goose, we wanted 3 Patron and 1 Goose. so he poured the 1 Patron shot in to the Goose shots. and poured 3 shots of goose, NOT CHILLED! have you ever taken a room temp shot of anything ever? it taste like hot ass. ugh. anyways. i asked him to pour a new shot of Goose and he said here's three. (which where the 4 shots he had mixed) effin Douche Bag. I don't think ill be going here again. your business thrives on your service. and your service was disgusting.",0
"We are shocked how badly the restaurant has deteriorated over the last 12 months, since the exit of their top chef. Now the seafood linguine features overcooked, rubbery seafood, and whole prawns which, since they are not peeled, force diners to immerse their hands in tomato sauce to extract prawns from their shells. The pizza, which used to be their signature dish, is now a distant shadow of what it used to be - soggy, unappetizing and bland. The service is now proffered by inhospitable servers who need to be told to provide plates and cutlery.",0
Four of us for holiday lunch. Sat at the bar by choice. Jared did a great job of service and very friendly. Ordered most of the apps and all were great. Stuffed hot peppers with cheese are simply the best. Mussels very acceptable. Calamari both ways right on and zucchini also great. Eggplant and pasta for mains and all in attendance very happy. I recommend for anyone.,3
Service takes forever! Food is inconsistent and poor. Eat down the street at chipotle or mcdonalds instead.,1
"Oh. My. Lanta. I loved the food. We had the burrata, tlc salad and Casanova pizza. The burrata with the slightly charred bread. Oh so good. Lovely lovely salad with beets, nuts and pears. And my fave was the pizza. Mmmmm. Arugula, dates, proscuitto and ricotta. Reminded me of one of my favorite Spanish tapas - dates stuffed with cheese and wrapped in bacon. I heart you, Federal Pizza.",4
"Great atmosphere and music! Yes it's loud but it's super fun. They were playing a really good mix of music. The food was fabulous. I had the rising sun burger with steak fries, and a house draft that was free with a four square check in. The wait for food is a while but it's worth the wait. Also, the wait is entertaining. Will be coming back for sure!! My friends all agreed with me.",4
"I live in Los Angeles and own a condo in Vegas. Last week we had a leak and my tenant (old lady) called these guys. The estimate was over $1100 they wanted to open the wall and need to call someone else to put a new drywall,pain the wall andetc.... I drove 5hours to Vegas called ServPro and ended up $380.00 without touching the wall. Old lady, owner out of town.No, No, No.",0
"When we are at Desert Ridge with the kids this always seems to be our \""go to\"".  Food is good, plenty of options for the kids and the service has always been great.",3
"This is a wonderful lunch/late night spot within the property.\n\nFirst the location is wonderful, located inside of the Bellagio Conservatory with views of the pool area.  Secondly, I've never had a bad item on the menu, the sandwiches are tasty and they have this amazing onion dipping sauce for the chips you can ask for which makes an awesome side!\n\nI've had the Belgian waffle after a night in the lounges and really hit the spot as a midnight snack!  I also came here before a UNLV game and chowed down on a BBQ Bacon burger which kept me full for hours!\n\nIf you are someone on a budget, but still wants to experience dining at Bellagio, this is your place to try!",3
"Best BBQ place in AZ. Five different sauces all on the table, yummy chips to try them all, awesome fries, mashed potatoes, and pork bbq sandwiches. Great service, always coupons or specials, sign up for the email list and you get coupons. Reasonably priced.",4
"I first went to Cartel over the summer and was impressed more with the concept then the execution. The bar was just inside the entrance, the loungey area nothing more than a couple of sofas. Plus I don't drink coffee and they didn't have much else.\n\nWent back for the Yelp Office Hours this month and am a new fan. They've moved the bar to the center of the space and the open space makes all the difference. Also have quirky art around the walls, some nice tables and the same sofas which now seem more inviting.\n\nAdd free wi-fi and hot chocolate to this list of praises and I've found a new \""escaping from work, but still working\"" place.",3
"I am like many others and have anxiety when going to the dentist but my experience with Dr Carson's office I found to be very pleasant. Very clean office and welcoming, staff are very helpful and very nice. Prices are very reasonable and are explained and there's no pressure to have work done. \n\nI have already referred family!",4
"After staying at the Wynn, Bellagio, Hotel 32, and Aria (meh!), I have to say that The Mirage is a bit.......older than what I normally prefer. \n\nThat being said, my two night stay there was well priced and decent for what it was. Good location on the strip, too, right across from Harrahs (...shudder..) where they have the Improv comedy club. \n\nOur room was on the 25th floor, which has it's own dedicated elevator. There was one king sized bed with a large bathroom that enclosed two sinks, toilet, a Jacuzzi style bathtub, and a separate shower. The mirror above the sinks and counter top was awesomely huge, though still lacked the appropriate lighting for applying makeup. That may sound strange, but it's something I take note of where ever I go, because I have yet to find a hotel that doesn't employ the use of odd 'energy saving' strange colored lighting in the bathrooms and rooms. As a result, sometimes it's hard to tell how dark your eye shadow really looks, or if your nose is really suddenly very pink, etc. Ladies may know what I mean  Possibly some men, too.\n\nA complaint - the satellite TV was sketchy at best. Several channels would appear for a few seconds before going black, and we had to switch to other channels and back again to get it to reappear. As you can imagine, the routine gets old. Oh well.\n\nOn the HUGE plus side - This is the only room I've stayed at that had a fan in the bathroom!! That's valuable when sharing a room with others. You know what I'm talking about. Don't try to deny it. You know. And I know. Everybody knows. So stop denying it.\n\nThe casino portion of the hotel is pleasant, with a wide range of slots and plenty of tables to play blackjack at. Be wary of the dealers - They are the luckiest people I know. They are also, overall, quite helpful when you're stumped about what move to make and willing help you out in \""What would YOU do, Carol?\"" situations. Alas, despite their helpful input, you are in no way guaranteed to keep any of the money you came to the table with. Drink responsibly.\n\nMy husband and I ate at the Cravings buffet in the casino, and we are sad to say we weren't impressed. My husband requested that I point out that the prime rib was way too well-done to be considered prime rib. It should be more red/pink, not light brown in the center. The prime rib was more like roast beef. The mashed potatoes are alright, I guess. \n\nMy biggest issue was with the pizza. It was nothing to be proud of, mostly bready with little sauce or cheese or toppings. The dessert selection, which is of the utmost importance to me, is severely lacking in quality diet-bustworthy deliciousness. I think the tastiest thing I ate from that section was the fresh fruit. Watermelon. Yum! The 'cheesecake' and 'mud pie' and 'creme brulee' were like imitation foods you see when touring open houses. Not the real thing, though still edible if you try hard enough. My favorite dish over all? The Hunan chicken in the Asian section of the buffet. I mean Asian food section, not people. \n\nWe ate at BLTs our second night. We shared a milkshake and waffle fries, and each had a huge burger. It was quite tasty and our waitress was polite and to the point, getting our order quickly and food out in a timely fashion. I want more.\n\nTwo nights in a row, i ended up buying a bag full of candy at the Sugar Factory store across from BLTs. The chocolate covered potato chips are good, as are the sour ribbon things. Malted milk balls are always a favorite. The white chocolate covered gummy bears were surprisingly tasty, too. Give it a go, why don't ya?\n\nAll in all, we had a wonderful time on my birthday trip, though I'm not sure if we'll stay there again unless we get a nice offer in the mail. \n\nP.S. Despite sleeping on a pile of sugar every night at home, I am in decent shape and mostly healthy. Not a single cavity in my 31 years, either, thank you very much!",2
"I still visit once in a while, but have really lost my love of this place. The last time we visited we were seated around back towards the bathroom.. and then forgotten about. I had to go find someone to take our order, and they were surprised to see us.\n\nThe time before that (and the time before that) I've had to wave to get someones attention while 4 or 5 employees hung out and chatted near the counter. \n\nThe food isn't bad, but we've had over easy eggs show up cooked solid, a request for crispy bacon show up as soft and greasy. It's as if they aren't paying attention to details back in the kitchen either. We've narrowed down what we order to a few menu items that show up reliably.\n\nGo if you aren't in a rush and aren't too picky about having things cooked to order.",1
Hadn't been here for some time.  Went late on a Friday with only 2 tables being served. Very disapointing.  Food portions much smaller and prices more expensive than I remember.  Wait staff very talkative and offended one of my dining companions.,0
"The best part of the experience was that the waiter completely forgot that I ordered an entr\u00e9e so we didn't have to eat anything else there. I say that because, after we had our salad and tasted the pizza, we were apprehensive about whatever would emerge next from the kitchen.\nThe value in fine dining comes from the value-added by the chef. This means flavor and creativity. But, what I found here was simply an assemblage of ingredients with no discernible contribution from the restaurant. We make goat cheese and beet salad at home with an orange vinaigrette dressing that IMHumbleO is fantastic. But, Spago apparently is too sophisticated to put leaves or dressing on their salad, opting instead for a DROP (literally) of olive oil and b. vinegar with a few pulverized specks of walnuts on top - not even candied, or maybe they were but there was too little to even taste.\n\nThe lamb pizza wasn't very good. It was dry and flavorless. The lamb had no taste - I almost thought it was pepperoni, except that that might have tasted like something.\n\nThe bread was cold and dry, served alongside cold butter.\n\nThe service? Well, I mentioned that the waiter completely forgot my order. It was the handcut fettuccine. He even asked if I wanted chicken or shrimp on it, and still forgot all about it. I'll attribute his oversight to the mercy of fate. Other than that, the service was OK.",1
Cool place with great food but terrible service.,2
"In general, I am a cirque-liker, not a cirque-lover, and I feel the same way about Zarkana: liked it, didn't love it.\n First of all, it's true, there is no story line, but if you could find ANY story line in Mystere or Zumanity or Love, then you are way more insightful than me. Ka was the only one that had a discernible plot to me, and even that was very wishy-washy and 'interpretive.' Zarkana is more like a true circus: one act comes on, then the ringmaster comes out and introduces (in gibberish) the next one. Not necessarily bad, just something to know.\n Second, the theatre and the sets are beautiful and well-constructed. They use projections to make the already-deep stage seem even deeper and that gives it a cool feel.\n The main negative, in my opinion, was the recycled acts from other shows. The girl on the springy board was in Mystere (I think), the guys running in the rotating hoops were in Ka, and the couple/single on the twisting harness have been in several shows. There were some unique acts, especially, as others have mentioned, the juggling, sand artist, and the people in silver hoops. Actually, I thought they could have used a little more of the silver hoops routine - something to make it totally crazy. I did enjoy the tightrope, the trapeze, and the cheerleader gymnastics routines for their sheer athleticism, but they weren't especially creative or unique.\n The second negative (for me) was the clown 'comedy' acts in between circus acts. I get that this is traditional cirque stuff and that they also need something to fill the time (thankfully the show was only ~90 minutes), but enough with these clowns! Their antics are 3 stooges-esque and although a surprising amount of people were chuckling at the fart jokes, the only person I heard really laughing was a kid sitting behind us.\n Overall, if it's your first CdS show, you will enjoy Zarkana, but you might as well spend half the money and go see Mystere for the same wow-factor. If you've been to a couple other shows already, I wouldn't bother with Zarkana.\n \nNote: I got the locals discount ($150 for 2 tix) and even though our seats were all the way to the side, the view was still excellent.\n Note 2: of the CdS shows I've seen, I liked them in this order: Zumanity, Love, Mystere, Ka, Zarkana.",2
They should have a rating of zero stars.  I play 20 bucks to wait an hour for at best a half clean car.  Stay away!!! Danny must not get his car cleaned here.,0
"Closest place you'll find to a kyo-po market like the ones in Santa Clara off El Camino. They have frozen pre-marinated kalbi/bulgogi along with freshly marinated ones you can buy at the butcher counter. This place has all the Korean spices, cooking sauces, snacks, etc... \n\nLarge parking lot, clean market, legit products... good prices.",3
I tried this restaurant based on the reviews that I read about the restaurant but when I tried it .. It wasn't good at all and it's expensive for what they are serving find another lebanese restaurant if you want to try Lebanese food.,0
"Maybe it's my personal taste. Maybe I'm just biased. Maybe I just set high standards for my fellow Filipinos, but if I'm coming here to fork up $7.95 to eat some decent Filipino dishes, I would hope that I could taste some culinary spirit in my taste buds.\n\n I love the concept of \""turo-turo\"". This means to point and pick your dishes. It reminds me a lot of my Philippine vacations when I was a little girl. I was always so eager to point at all the things I liked. \n\nNow, I only come here for the sake of my mother. She loves this place, the dishes they offer, and the taste of home. But for me, I feel like this place just doesn't live up to culinary expectations of a really good, home cooked Filipino cuisine. \n\nThe dishes they offer here is a hit or miss for me. Yesterday, it was a miss. A variety of the dishes I picked out were really cold, and have been sitting out for a while. The dishes also started to taste the same as well. I love Tocino, but when I took a bite of the Tocino dish they offered, it was REALLY dry. It had none of that awesome thick burning sweet sauce I love so much. The Pancit Malabon is also my favorite noodle dish. However, there were no pieces of chicken or meat to found. There were no pork grind crumbs, or any hint of green garnish from chopped onion that I hoped for. It was all noodle. My heart was really torn. I really wanted to cry.\n\nMy experience here just isn't satisfying for me. Unless they can cook better than my mommy, auntie, grandma, uncle, cousin, friends, and my friends' parents. Then I won't feel like they can provide me anything of monetary value.",1
"Very well done version of the touring show. The singing was excellent--the variety of songs were really incredible. You can't help but tap your feet, clap your hands and sing along. \n\nThis one-act show has no set changes and is an examination of one night in the lives of Elvis, Jerry Lee Lewis, Johnny Cash, and Carl Perkins as they collaborated in the old Sun Studios together with their old manager before each of them exploded into musical phenoms. It's a simple show with classic tunes, superb singing, and live instrument playing. With so many shows over doing it with distracting glitz and set changes, the simplicity of Million Dollar Quartet is downright endearing. You catch your breath when they show the original photograph from the actual night the show is about and see the real Elvis, Killer, Cash, and Perkins playing together. It's truly a glimpse into a historical moment in music and one you will not regret seeing. \n\nDefinitely worth the price of admission!",3
For now this is the best Mexican food in Edinburgh in my humble opinion. It is true I have yet to try a few other places but for now this one is it.\n\nEverything tasted fresh and packed a punch! Just the way I like it! The waiter was a really nice lad who even went as far as to show me the kitchen and the burrito making station. So I can vouch that everything is super fresh and handmade. The pico de gallo is chunky cause they cut it that way by hand!  I have yet to try the Nachos which were merely mentioned in another review but now I am on a mission.\n\nExpect another review (with more detail) coming soon...,3
"Let's start with the positives:\n\n1. Service-- Excellent! My drink was refilled, and my dirty plates were cleared off instantly.\n2. Clean restaurant, and nicely decorated. \n3. *****BONUS**** - 2 flat screen televisions were on during dinner-showing the NBA finals.\n4. Sushi roll was good (my wife and I go with the cucumber rolls w/ avocado). This is a good option for those who really don't like seafood all that much.\n\nNegatives:\n\n1. The salad which is part of the 2-item dinner special had way too much dressing on it. \n2. The bulgoki beef was disappointing. The flavor was ok, but the beef itself was a little soggy and fatty.\n\nFrom my experience, there are better sushi places in the area. I love Sushi, and Momo sushi come to mind.",2
"Beware of the fees and don't expect to get the type of car you reserved, expect a smaller cheaper car without a consulate price reduction.",0
Love the cheesteaks here especially after a night out.  The new location is more spacious but less convenient for me.  Love that it's open 24 hours.,3
BCBG outlet is a great find.  Imagine $300 dresses at $40!  My sister from England went crazy there.  Quiksilver has some great bargains too.  Better than overpriced shops at the Strip.,3
"For two games for an adult, it's \u00a312.49, which seems reasonable to me. They estimate around an hour per game if your lane is full (6 people) so I guess that works out that you're paying around the equivalent of minimum wage for a good deal of fun.\n\nIt's a bowling alley, with everything that goes with it (arcade machines, terrible music, and goodness knows who else's fingers have been in those holes before yours) but it feels friendlier to me than most bowling alleys I've been to. Also, while I can't speak for the rest of their food, the chicken nuggets are not bad, and the drinks are what I would call fairly reasonably priced.\n\nThe sad part is that they can't do score sheet printouts, so the only answer is to snap a quick photo of the score screen with your phone. It seems odd to me that this is central Edinburgh's primary alley and it doesn't do the things that the bowling hall in rural Yorkshire did - score printouts, and humorous animations on the occasion of a gutterball, split, spare or strike. It's basic. But there's also a sneaky thing. If you bowl it just right and catch it just as your first ball is going through the system, your second ball can bounce off the mechanism and hit some of the pins it missed as it went by. Woop woop!",2
"We got here in time for lunch and I suspect breakfast is superb. We had the bbq pork platter; it was very good, but just as you would suspect for NC bbq, vinegar based.. This was served with a vinegar and room temp slaw. I liked both, but not the Texas bbq I am used to. We also had the meatball sub which was superb and homemade in every way.\n\nThe chicken croissant sandwich was homemade. The croissant was amazing, but the chicken salad was with dark and white meat and more savory than sweet. Opposite of my taste for chicken salad, but  I am sure a fan for many. \n\nI think this bakery has delicious bread and excellent service. We saw several people leaving with a pizza, so i might try this next time. \n\nI highly recommend this for a try, especially if its to just order a fresh homemade croissant.",3
It's that it was terrible it's that it's sooooo incredibly generic and it was one of the loudest restaurants I've ever been to. Too generic for me to go back. Also waaaay to overpriced for the quality. Olive Garden is better and cheaper.,1
"Hmmmmmmmm..... i dont know about this place. A friend from work recommended it to me saying it was the BOMB chinese food. Pleaseeeeeeeeeeeeeee!!!!! Hell Nahhhhhhh. Food looked like it was Ummmmmmm doggy dog food. It looked like Slop with the heavy Sauce over the food. Not tasty at all, AT ALL!!! The only two things i liked was the egg roll and the fried rice. But to that it wont make me come back for more. I eaten at better hole in the wall chinese food joints.\n\nThat reminds me, gonna slap my friend upside his head for recommending me to this place.",1
Before a Suns game.. we decide to head to Turf for a bit of pregame fatty grub and cider.. Hit the spot.. Do I love love this place.. umm no.. but my friend does. It is a good place to pre-game the game; has decent drink specials and bar food .. So Ill have to always rate it high for the fun of it.,3
"I too am a native Midwesterner. I too am highly disappointed by this \""signature\"" steak and shake. I agree with everyone complaining about the fries. Mine were old and way too salty. I like to tear up my fries and put them in my chili and it sort of ruined the chili. The service was very fast and I'm sure I will return at some point but I feel like a kid who just found out Santa isn't real. You still enjoy Christmas but its' just not the same anymore.",2
"Waitin for takeout i see a dine in customer go up to the counter. One of the workers talks to customer then yelled to another worker \"" you messed up again!\"" im thinkin oh geez i hope they didnt screw my order up too. Sure enough... I got thin crust when i had asked for hand tossed. \n\nEven though the girl who took my order was sugary sweet, Still not a good first impression that they cant work together to do things accurately.\n\nas for the pizza: It really looked appetizing but the cheese overpowered everything, very strong orange cheese type flavor. It was so dry I didnt taste the sauce at all.",1
"Custard isn't really like anything I've tried before. It's rich and creamy. I got chocolate the first time I went there, and I was told by pretty much everyone that I made the wrong choice. Come here for the lemon custard. I haven't gotten into all of the other complicated choices, mainly because the lemon custard on a sugar cone is so darn good! And the prices are extremely reasonable. My one complaint, and it's a small one, is that they don't take credit cards. Oh well, guess I'll have to keep cash around for when the mood strikes!",4
"Bento box Blah.\n\nWould LOVE to give this place 5 Stars because the atmosphere is poppin,' the DJ was rockin,' and they have flavored Saki for the takin'! But everything ELSE considered, it winds up a solid 3 stars.\n\nSeems like there are a few people that had a rocky start with their dining experience at Geisha A Go Go- such was also the case with our group. \n\nIt was Saturday night and we were asked to relocate to another table shortly after being seating because another party, that was already seated and enjoying their sushi, preferred our location. I know, strange... to cut my venting about That to a minimum- we did eventually get menus, a server, and water... yay.\n\nDJ was amazing- better than the club we ended up going to! Mixed B.E.P.s, Tupac, a lil Biggie Smalls... perhaps a lil Britney :). Bathrooms were also unique, contemporary, and clean. The Lettuce Wrap App with all of the Tasty dipping sauces is a great decision.\n\nA poor dinner choice is the scallop bento box... Three scallops. Needless to say I regretted not getting sushi.  Instead of dining here, I would unregrettably recommend G.A.G.G. as a chill venue to kick-it.\n\nDefinitely want to go back and take advantage of the Happy Hour Special they have available through Yelp!",2
"LOCATION\nAh yes, the Stratosphere. The North Star of Las Vegas. I can always find my way around by looking for the largest structure in the land. \n\nWhile the casino is away from the active Strip, located in an area that's a bit run down, it also means less street traffic to deal with, you're close to the freeway, and is fairly easy to get to Downtown Fremont Street. Just depends on how you look at things, I guess.\n\nHOTEL\nI have had the opportunity to stay here a few times within the past year. Try booking through hotelclub.com. Considered one of the more \""economical\"" casino hotels, don't be expecting a lap of luxury so set your expectations as such. Nevertheless, the rooms do look remodeled. Some of the amenities: iron and board, small closet and chest of drawers, a TV with limited channels (at least they have ESPN)... One time I tried to turn on the blowdryer, there was a pop and then smoke. I was able to call the front desk to have a replacement sent over later that day.\n\nSome perks I like: When you book a room, you get access to their impressive gym. Did I mention 24 hour access?! Also free admission up the Stratosphere tower when you show your room key. \n\nThree more tips before going up the Tower:\n1) Pay attention to their operating hours,\n2) There is a security check before entering the elevators,\n3) A green screen photo is taken before going up the tower, so don't wear green (sadly I made that mistake and my photo came out as a floating head).\n\nYou can check-out from the TV menu, as many other casinos implement this as well. Just leave your keys in the room. Checkout time here is 11am.\n\nCASINO\nComparing the casino experience with that of others along the Strip, it's simply average. It's certainly not as glamorous or glitzy. But if you're the type of person just looking for machines to play, then you might be satisfied. It's close enough to Circus Circus too, if you want a place to entertain your child (or inner child).\n\nDINING OPTION\nPlate (the buffet) is just average as well. If you decide to dine here though, make sure you have a players card to get their membership discount, as that will cut the costs by 25%. I've also found the service here to be rather sub-par as well, as servers would simply disappear after a while. Our family dined here right as Sunday Brunch ended, so I was able to see the transition into dinner. I must say, the brunch is far better, and I was disappointed to see the iced crab legs taken away.\n\nOther dining options: McDonald's, this sub sandwich place, a Mexican place... Roxy's Diner is 24 hrs. There's even a Fat Tuesday here. *heh*\n\nVERDICT\nConsider Stratosphere an inexpensive place, whether to stay or play. If that's your thing, then enjoy! If not, look elsewhere. As for me, as long as the price point remains one of the cheaper room options in Sin City, you might find me here. Not so much to play or eat though.",3
"Worst service ever, couldnt get our orders right, brought our food before our kids food. Didnt even give us silverware or napkins or plates for our appetizer. When they did bring plates, they were wet! Horrible.",1
"I made a yelp account just to give this 1 star.\n\nService was pretty awful though, one of the girls was pretty nice, but I won't be returning, there's plenty of places to get icecream....",0
"I lived down Central from Three Amigos for about 2 years. Let's just say that I could never have frequented this place enough. It's a perfect shining mexican flagship for the Plaza area. Nestled in a dive-y little strip (thus, parking can be a bit of a problem on busy nights) and quaint/understated. Three Amigos is definitely a go-to for authentic Mexican in Charlotte. \n\nThe pros outweigh the cons tenfold for this place. The only negatives to report, which I'm pretty sure everyone has experienced, is the service. You might wait for a half hour for your app/entree or MUCH longer with no whisper of timeframe, and its iffy you'll be able to communicate a need for a swift dining experience. This can be a bit annoying for some diners. I'd recommend hitting up Three Amigos when you've got some time to kill. This place gets SLAMMED, too. Kick back and take advantage of the humongous margaritas. \n\nThe food is to die for. I've never had better queso fundido. Definitely worth the $4 to pair with the fresh salsa and chips. We heartily enjoyed every last drop and even used what was left on our entrees. \n\nBistec a la Mexicano was incredible. So many saut\u00e9ed veggies and perfectly seasoned steak with rice and all of the standard Mexican accouterment. So much on my plate it was hard to consume all of the goodness in one sitting. My compliments to the chef on this dish. Incredible flavors. \n\nUn Chile Relleno will make you melt. The only thing I could say is that I wish it were \""Dos\"" Chile Rellenos. Filled with amazing cheese and avocado. \n\nPrices are rather fair for the level of flavor and execution. Love this spot in Plaza. Whenever I crave Mexican, Three Amigos is what I think of first. \u00a1Ole!",4
"It's always a pleasure to go into the best hookah bar in Montreal. Amazing staff, wonderful selection of top quality tobacco and a fun environment where you can have some drinks, or even some delicious teas. \n\nOverall an exceptional experience for anyone looking for a relaxed environment!",4
"Disappointed! Received a Christmas gift that was the wrong size, unable to find something I care for to replace it. The customer service reps were very helpful, but follow you through the store. I felt a little pressured to purchase which made me uncomfortable. In the end I could not find anything I liked and was only able to get a store credit. Since the stock is depleted from Christmas I hope I can back to find something later to use the credit. I will not purchase from them in the future.",0
"It wasn't what we thght . Luckily we walked from Fremont so it wasn't a wasted cab fee... Most of building was closed off.. I'm guessing where they film is what we didn't see cause it looks nothing like the show...  Everything there was very spendeee (Rolex watches, old guns overpriced jewelry, etc)...  No one there except a glimpse of chumlee\nNot worth the cab ride but the day was sunny and the wait was not horrible -just sad that it was not the place u c on TV...",1
"i really wanted to like this place, i really did. Its a Friday and we expected it to be busy, but aside from one large party, there were many empty tables. We sat down and were more than a little surprised when we had to wait for the waitress to walk by us four times and start setting the empty tables before the bar tender came over to give us menus. \n\nWe went simple: beef tacos and enchiladas. Honest to goodness, taco bell beat these tacos. They had hardly anything in them. I'm sorry, but if I wanted to eat an empty taco shell I could have done that at home. The enchilada sauce was unimpressive at best.\n\nWhat really got the raised eyebrow was the $26.00 check. No drinks, no appetizers. Just one terrible taco plate and one mediocre enchilada plate. \n\nWe won't be going back.",0
"What a nice hotel. I mean it's beautiful with all of the African artwork and hieroglyphics all over the place. The outside lights up at night and the Pharaoh statue outside is breathtaking. \n\nThe elevators are rickity and loud and scary. The best part was getting on them with a drunk person to watch them freak out..FUNNY!! Because The Luxor is the shape of a triangle when you go up  you kind of lean in and when you go down you tilt backwards..like a rollercoster..\n\nTry and get a room that is facing all the action.. our room was stuck behind all of the raised decor so our view sucked but I could care less...\n\nI swear to God if one more MLife person had come up to me and asked if \""I wanted to see a show\"".. or \""how long I was staying\"" I would have socked them in the face. This one lady asked me and my mom twice in the same breath. I was like \""ma'am you just saw us walk pass you!\""\n\nNice, clean hotel rooms \nLots of slots \n2 Starbucks inside\n3rd largest hotel in the US",2
"Nice hotel    It is a nice property and mantained pretty good.\nNice staff     They were really great, real people\nDecent pool    I was the only one there and the spa needed water\nNice rooms    Really large compared to some others I have been in.",2
"We've ordered delivery from them twice. I like my Thai food pretty spicy so the first time I ordered all 3 dishes as a 7/10. One of them had good heat, one was average, and one was pretty bland. The second time I ordered all 8/10. One was great, one was average and one was borderline too hot. All of them were great but be forewarned that the spice level will vary. The delivery was fast and the person that delivered was very friendly and polite. Prices are totally appropriate. We will order from them again and we plan on eating on site soon too.",4
"I went here because it was the closest restaurant to Discount Tire... What an awesome place, and I will go out of my way to go back! \n\nFriendly staff, clean restaurant, and outstanding food. Chips and salsa were great, and the food was delicious!\n\nThanks!",4
"I went to Garfield's for Sunday brunch. All signs pointed to a delightful Sunday brunch with a view of the lake. But don't let the lake view fool you. This place was pretty bad. The service was very slow and inaccurate. And on top of that, the food wasn't all that great either. I ordered a chopped salad. Simple. You can't screw that up right? It was the saddest salad I have ever seen. My fellow diners actually teased me about it. It was a small portion of 99% iceberg lettuce. There was literally only a couple pieces of tomato that were the size of a peppercorn. Also, there was a light sprinkling of ham. It was completely underwhelming. I've seen side salads at mcdonalds that looked and tasted better. \n\nOne person at our table ordered French toast, which comes with berries. The order arrived with no fruit whatsoever. We notified one person who told us they gave us someone else's order, but he'd bring out fruit. A couple people had finished their meals when we notified a 2nd person of the missing fruit who also said he'd bring it. The person eating the French toast slowed down to wait for the fruit. By the time the fruit came everyone was done with their meals and the French toast was now cold and 3/4 eaten. Yum. \n\nIn a nutshell: Plain food with poor service. Go somewhere else.",0
"I would give this place a 2 star, but I am going to give it a 3 because the food was very good, fresh tasting and the waitress was very sweet. When my grandmother and I came in we had to wait about 5 mins. until the lady in the back noticed we where there she was in the kitchen doing something. She sat us down and took our order she had a happy attitude twards us\n\nGenera t'so chicken- big peices and nice and fresh tasting and the meat was all white not brown like sometimes when places try to cut corners.\n\nBbq pork lo mein- I asked for white rice on both of these and this one came with fried rice witch I didn't want. I told her and she said she was very sorry the chicken came with white rice. She said she was going to bring more white rice but It was okay we really didn't need it. \n\nAll and all the lunch prices are good it lasts until 4pm witch is a nice change from most places. And the staff is nice, on the way out she said your new I never seen your face here before; I thought that was kind of cute she noticed :).",2
I wish I had the same experience as all the other reviews.  He was called to hook up 2 new ceiling fans which already had existing wiring and wall switches.  Could not hook them up properly so one switch turned on the light and the other turned on the fan even though the fan that was there before had the exact same set up.\n\nHe was also brought out to install overhead garage storage shelves which were bought from Costco and had detailed instructions and just needed to be attached to the studs in the ceiling of the garage.  After over an hour of doing I don't know what he comes in to tell me he can't do it.  While he was very nice and polite I would not hire him back again.,0
"For our delivery they said 35 minutes, which turned into 103 minutes before we got our food. The owner was apologetic, and recooked and delivered our order.   He said they have a new delivery person who got lost.  \n\nThankfully the food tasted good.  So they regained a star with that.  I am not sure if we will try this location again after the long wait...  even though the food was pretty tasty.",1
Food and service good but VERY pricey especially for lunch. A simple cheese quesadilla was 7.50 and to top it a small scoop of sour cream in a little taco shell was an additional 2.50!  Probably wont go there again too expensive when you can go to others for much larger portions and free side of sour cream.,1
"My friend and I went for lunch today, as it is close to both our offices. We had never been there, and for good reason after going. The place has an 80's decor, that's the good part. The oil they fry their chips in must be very old because every chip I ate tasted like I was just eating a chunk of lard, literally disgusting. The salsa & bean dip was the best part. I had a beef taco that completely fell apart, and the rice & beans were mush. My friend had the pollo fundido w/unmelted cheese. With in the hour after we left the place, we both got sick w/the runs ( think it was the lard tasting chips).  I came back to work, and my coworker said he went last week , his girlfriend got the pollo fundido burrito (same as my friend), and she literally got food poisoning, hurled7 times ! Wish I would have known before going there! It's expensive too, so not worth it. Not Recommended whatsoever! Some Burros is 100 times tastier & it's fast food!",0
"Heaven's Best was recommended to us by our realtor.  I called today and was able to get my carpet cleaned today.  Darnell was our guy.  He was nice, courteous, and informative.  I highly recommend Heaven's Best and Darnell.  We're leaving Las Vegas, but I have already looked the company up in our new location to be.  I will be using this company again for sure.",4
"New japanese restaurant in the southwest part of LV. Bf and I came out here and were very pleased. Since it newly opened, they had a special going on. 3 specialty rolls for $54 bucks. Overall, rolls were decent. Decor is very zen, and a lot bigger than most sushi restaurants located in this part of town. You also have the option to do hibachi, which we still ave yet to do.",3
"SO SLOOOOOOOW. \n\nI really like their jerk chicken. From what I've heard, it's pretty authentic, especially the part where they literally butcher chop the chicken into random pieces. If you order their Jerk Chicken, you can get a leg, or maybe a wing, or maybe a cut of something and something else, or... who knows, it's a surprise. I've never tried ordering a specific part of the chicken, but I bet they would just look at me funny if I did.\n\nBut yes, their service is extremely slow. So slow that you would think there is only one person in the back doing the work of 4 people, but I don't think that's the case. I think it's just the culture of the business they run. Go prepared to stay there longer than your typical hour or so because you will be waiting. Expect to repeat things multiple times to the server, who is usually very sweet but also forgetful and unattentive. If you want something, ask for it specifically. \n\nI literally sat there for 2.5 hours one time. I had decent company, so it wasn't that bad, but I was STARVING. I was craving their jerk sauce, so I had just to wait. If you really like a good kick, ask for their homemade hot sauce. I can take some pretty spicy things, and this one is enough to make me cringe. Because it's homemade, ithe hotness does differ from time to time. \n\nI haven't tried anything else there, but if I am waiting an 45-60 mins on average for food, I want to make sure it's the best thing on the menu.",2
"I stayed at the MGM a while back and I have to honestly say, its probably the most boring, bland hotel I have ever stayed at in Vegas. Starting off with the hotel itself, it offers a decent environment as far as decorations and overall ambiance goes. It almost looks like a cheap mall that was remade into a hotel lobby and casino. Next is the room. Once again, one of the most bland and boring rooms I have had the pleasure staying at. Not a real WOW factor as fas as the experience goes. Very normal, dry and simple. Not to mention that I had an AMAZING view of the airport, yuck. I spent more time at other hotels than I did at my very own. MGM needs to spice things up a little bit, just to lighten up the scene. \n\n   I recommend staying here if your looking for a not so Vegas hotel as far as movement and excitement goes. Other than that, i'd look elsewhere. Also, kiddos might enjoy it a little more with the Lion den and Rainforest cafe being in there.",1
"I effing HATE this place!\n\nI will only come here for a band I just can not miss.\n\nTickets - Online in advance is more expensive than buying at the door. They'll charge you like $6 for buying online & another undisclosed $3 for will call. Lying cheating bastards.\n\nLines & waiting - I didn't have to wait at all. There were barely any people there yet. I got there at 6:30 and ended up pretty close to the stage.\n\nFrisking & pat downs - These will be done by a same gendered person. Girls, they'll want to look in your purse.\nThis is pretty much against the 4th Amendment:\n\""The right of the people to be secure in their persons, houses, papers, and effects, against unreasonable searches and seizures, shall not be violated...\"" \nBut if you bitch they have the right to refuse service/entrance. Fun!\n\nDecor & cleanliness - It's pretty dirty everywhere. But that's to be expected. Lots of people coming & going all the time. You'll look up to see that the ceiling is bare & exposed. Pray your bladder holds out on you until you can get to another location. Don't even go into the restrooms if you don't have to, you'll wish you had a hazsmat suit on. Yuck!\n\nDrinks - There's a bar & they don't separate people under 21. I imagine it would be easy for an older friend to get under 21 people drunk in the crowd :D\n\nHeat - It's constantly hot. No matter what the weather outside is like go dressed like you do in the middle of summer phx heat. There was 1 lousy fan blowing. It might as well not even have been there.\n\nMusic - For some reason between bands they play weird music that doesn't fit the style you're there to see. I saw Fireworks, Saves the Day, Hellogoodbye, & New Found Glory. They played 80's pop music. Ok...\n\nSound - The sound didn't suck as much as other reviews led me to believe. It's up to the band to make the sound people get it right. Hellogoodbye made sure they sounded good. Saves the Day, not so much.\n\nSecurity - Never enough!!! There were some big beefy dudes up front to push back or catch the crowd surfers. I saw 2 guys actually in the crowd. With all the moshing going on, that's not gonna cut it. People got kicked in the head, elbowed, spit on, stepped on, pushed, almost crushed, & even I almost got into a fight w/ a short asshole mosher that might have been a guy... perhaps when his balls drop. Prepare to leave with bruises.\n\nBasically, this place is like an armpit or perhaps the donkeys ass of venues.\nFail.",0
"I have been a long time customer of the Dobson/Baseline location. However, the last time I went in things had definately changed. The sales people were aggressive in trying to up sell extras AFTER we stated exactly what we wanted. They were also very unorganized and claimed that a pair of glasses we had been waiting 2 weeks for had come in and that they called us...\""which they didn't\"" so the glasses sat there for almost 5 days, when I asked if they have a system in which they call people who have not come to pick up their glasses, in case they didn't get the message, the woman says to me \"" oh no, that would be impossible, we have too many customers\"" well, you just lost 3 because of your blatant laziness. Thanks a lot Vision works. Pfft.",1

"Following the La Canasta tradition, this location hits it out of the ballpark. The food is great, the prices are extremely similar to the other La Canasta locations and they have a chip/salsa bar!!! The flour chips are delicious; not greasy and very easy to consume too many if you aren't careful. My boyfriend and I thoroughly enjoyed our meal.",3
"I wish we could rate half stars!\n\n50-50 experience on this one.  Been wanting to try Angkor based on the Yelp reviews, so we finally decided to give it a try on a slow Saturday night.\n\nWalking in, there was only one other party present at 7pm (a little concerning).  This place screams American Chinese restaurant with a little extra polished charm.\n\nThe staff were great.  We were greeted an sat immediately (then again, almost noone else was there), and we were offered some suggestions on what to order.\n\nDecided to start with the spring rolls.  The rice paper could have been prepped a little better (a bit chewy), but overall, they were pleasing (crisp, fresh and minty).  We decided to go with the Cambodian Short Ribs (C16) and they quickly came out.  Slowly stewed short ribs with pineapple, mushrooms, tomatoes and a rich earthy sauce on steamed rice.  Definitely stick to your ribs comfort food that reminded me a lot of a cross between Korean short ribs and curry.\n\nMy lack of decision ultimately comes from my lack of confidence in the menu as a whole.  While our entree was good, the spring rolls left a decent amount to be desired.  Not sure we'd proactively make the hike out to Carnegie again for this place unless we were already in the area (though then again, the one other table drove the entire way from Greensburg to eat there...  so that's a promising sign).",2
Parking is a rip off and hard to figure out. Suggest u Park accross green/grey stadium entrance for a donation to the local church ($5 suggested) No trash cans in the parking lot. NO BAGS!? Travel light ladies or u gotta lose your purse. 16 oz beer is $8.25 so not a bad deal. Better food at aloha stadium IMHO.,2

"2.5 Stars\n\nI've experienced so much better in so many other hotels. Three stars for the price, 2 stars for the overall quality. \n\nA lot of robotic treatment over the phone before arriving as well as once we arrived. There was also a lot of unlearned ignorance with the hotel operators who told us that it was available to visit other hotel's pools at a charge and the Bellagio told us that they never heard of anything like that, and the MGM Grand said out right - NO! \n\nAt least the management were accommodating (though it wasn't easy). One of the manager's was nice but was more talk/schmooze than action (I guess she really didn't have a lot to work with here).\n\nClean rooms some partially updated, some not. Our initial non smoking room smelled of smoke. Sinks and tubs way out dated & rusty parts.\n\nOverall OK, but only if you are not picky nor if you pay attention to details.",1

I have been to a couple different threading places but I've never been to an Eyebrows R Us. My first experience with them has been awesome. Friendly reception. Mr. Sudi was the one who did the work and he did an amazing job! His hand work was very light and this visit has been the least painful I've had thus far. Mr. Sudi does exactly what you ask for and is willing to make sure you achieve the look you are going for. I definitely plan to go back!,3

"If you're craving the McRib at a time when it's not offered at McD's, then Dickey's has got you covered!\n\nDon't be fooled by the smell.. Dickey's is to BBQ what Taco Bell is to Mexican. I went to Dickey's for lunch and ordered the Westerner, a sandwich with pulled pork and sausage, along with macaroni and cheese and loaded mashed potatoes. The sandwich wasn't horrible. It just wasn't good. The bread was pretty nice. Someone on here described the Mac and Cheese and being Krafty. To that I say, don't get your hopes up. Kraft is much better then their cheese sauce concoction. The loaded mashed potatoes were actually pretty good as was the sweet tea. I finished my meal with a complimentary cone. It was labeled ice cream, but don't get your hopes up. It's cold and has an appearance similar to ice cream, but it's definitely not ice cream.\n\nThe service was good, the place was clean and the prices were reasonable. I think it's a great place to take kiddos. I don't think I'd make an effort to go back, but I wouldn't be opposed to it if I had a coupon. Bon appetit.",1
"Shaina was very friendly! Everything was clean and hygienic. She did a great job! When I was looking for a good place to go to, hygiene was #1 on my list. Wipes were provided to freshen up, she wore gloves, fresh paper was laid on the waxing bed, there was no double dipping, gentle and effective wax, fabric sheets to remove the wax were used instead of pressed or paper ones, and she used focused light throughout to make sure she found all the hairs. She then went in with tweezers to remove the few hairs that were left. It was a wonderful experience. I got there late and I was still taken in. It also only took about 15 minutes. Shaina made it as painless as possible and also had me do breathing techniques for the more sensitive areas. It was a breeze! Also, on the website they also let you know not to worry about trimming which was nice so I didn't have to worry about preparing beforehand.",4
The food here is good but overrated. I was so gassy after I ate from here. But it was still somewhat memorable.,2
"The best perk about this spot was that we could sit outside and listen to music at the Montreal Jazz Festival. The menu is vast, which is nice. However, the execution of the food is just average. I ordered a savory crepe with chicken. It took them THREE times to bring the right dish, and it wasn't even a special order. The waitress seemed unconcerned and just blamed the kitchen. When it did arrive, it was basically a premade  crepe without the filling really cooked. They sell cocktails, which weren't bad (my husband tried a Bellini), but honestly not much more than an IHOP in the US.",1
"Having enjoyed the Western Ave restaurant, I was thrilled to walk by and see Nicky's on Penn and Ninth. Wow, they are so not ready for business. \n\nWe were seated with Lunch menus (at dinner time - we thought perhaps this site had lunch on one side & dinner on the other side so didn't ask) and not asked if we wanted anything to drink - I called the waitress back to request water and ginger tea. Someone else asked if we wanted appetizers, which were listed on the Lunch side, so after a moment of confused hesitation, we asked for the tofu with spinach & peanut sauce (okay). \n\nIt wasn't until I asked if the curries on the lunch menu were available that they said we had the wrong menus, handed us dinner menus, and then stood there, as if we would be ready to instantly order off the huge dinner menu we hadn't yet read. At that point, with more/different options, we realized there was a different appetizer we would have preferred. I asked about the wild versus green mango curry, was advised to go with the green mango curry, and then was delivered plain mango curry. They admitted the mistake when they came to the table - when I asked what type of curry the mango curry was, the waiter said it's the same as the green curry only without the green color. Hmm. I am happy to try anything, and my friend's dinner was there of course, but I should have insisted they switch it for the correct dish. What I got had no flavor at all other than the hot pepper - and no ingredients other than mango and fried tofu (I'd specifically asked about the vegetables in the other curry dishes, so their absence was unwelcome). I'd asked for a 7 - it made my nose run a little, but I could discern no actual curry taste. I asked for some steamed broccoli to put in, which they brought, but it was mushy - and I still could not taste curry when I soaked the florets. Very odd. I should have sent the dish back and asked for something else - especially since they charged full price for their mistake (and I did not eat even half of the dish - and did not take any to go). They did not offered, even when they saw I wasn't eating the plain mango curry, whether I wanted the green mango curry entree I had ordered (though, at that point, we needed to get going anyway).\n\nVery very disappointed with the service and food.",0
I am inclined to give five stars but can't. Their service to the community is more than five stars. Their service snd politeness has been 5*. I used to purchase stuffed animals to give away at work. They were reasonable to the point that I got 300 of them\nto take to Katrina processing center to donate. I have purchased a lot of books which I would rate 3-4*s\nIf something wasn't just right for you it might have been a work in progress.,3
"A great place to eat-in, but A-OK for take out.  Since I do more take out than eat-in I give it a 3 star rating.  I don't know why the take out food can't be as great as their eat-in selection, which is so fantastic...",2
"Love the wings, service is cute. We doubted our waitress would remember our order because she didn't write anything down but she was SPOT ON.\n\nYou know what you get in Hooters. Well done.",2
"For Vegas, this is probably the best deal on snacks you'll find.  Big sandwiches, bagels and lox, fresh bananas.  Decent food, prepared well, and priced no worse than an actual deli in NYC.  Why?  It's next to the sports book at the MGM Grand.  They don't want to old guys betting on horses to leave their seats.",2
"Average run of the mill ehh Pho place\n\nDecor: nice clean interior\n\nPho is always the best hangover cure, however this place is an ehh.\n\nThe broth wasn't as flavorful and I felt like they were super stingy on the meat and veggies.\nOne plate of veggies for 12 bowls? Really. =[ The plate of meat had 5 pieces all about half of a baseball size of the thawed frozen cut meat.\n\nOverall - there are plenty of other Pho places that are better. Skip this one.",1
"It was ok. The check in process took too long. The hotel was giving us the wrong room. I had to stand my ground, politely, until we got the room we had reserved and paid for. The room was nice and clean. Very comfy feather top bed. One thing, the room is never complete dark due to the drapes not going complete over the shade. So, we woke up earlier than we wanted to. Meaning, waking up after only 3 hours of sleep. By the way...no bath tubs! \""It's in the small print\"". The hotel was built without bathtubs. I found this incredibly funny, after my annoyance wore off. No smoking room smelled good.  Another thing - pizza flyers all over the hallways.  Looked messy.  Nobody cleaned them up.",2
"Very, very poor service.  Mediocre food.  Will not be going back.  Definitely do not recommend.",0
"There are so many nail salons that feel like fast food restaurants. Just trying to get you in and out fast. They stay in business because they are cheap and you can drop in without an appointment whenever you need to make your hands and nails pretty in a hurry. But personally, I am only willing to pay for a pedicure if it actually is an enjoyable experience. If you are just going to slap some paint on my toes and scrape my heels like you were grating Parmesan cheese then I can do that myself at home for free. To get a truly great experience that will actually leave you feeling pampered and relaxed all day, you have to go to a spa. I had the privilege of getting a \""zero gravity\"" pedicure at an Aveda spa in San Diego once (i.e. they do your toes while you are lying down on a massage table) and also had pedicures at couple of resorts while on vacation that were truly great experiences but still at the end of the day cost too much to do on a regular basis. \n\nPink Polish falls somewhere in the middle between the typical revolving door nail salons and the full-on spa experience. And their prices reflect that. $30 for \""spa\"" pedicure and $45 for \""deluxe\"" (only difference is extra callous removal treatment). They also have an express pedicure which is basically just a polish change for $18 but if you select that option you are almost guaranteed to get an attitude from whoever is working on your toes. In fact, most of the women who work here seem to have chips on their shoulders. The quality of service really is hit or miss. I have seen the same woman be sweet as honey to one of her regulars and cop an attitude with the next woman in the chair who is there for the first time. I really don't get it. \n\nAnyway, I keep coming here because I just want a nail salon that is a little more plush, a little more luxurious, and basically just a little more girly than most of the other places around town. If I could find the same atmosphere somewhere else for the same (or hopefully a little less) money without the attitude, I would definitely go there but I am just not sure such a place exists.",2
Awesome place...a little pricey but it one of my favorite places to go!,4
"This company run tours in most of Europe's capitals, with the unique selling point of making them entirely free (sort of). I have particularly fond memories of being on their New Berlin Tour a year or two ago, and trying to find a suitable place to sneak off after 3 hours of cold, rain, and the guide's dulcet tones got just a bit too much.\n\nBeing a less sprawling metropolis, Edinburgh's version is thankfully a bit shorter, yet the cold, rain and dulcet tones are now joined by the biting coastal wind that's a permanent feature of the city, so you'll still spend most of the tour in appalling discomfort. As for content, it's basically just all the usual tourist stops, which are fascinating for actual tourists but less so when you see them every day. It's still nice to learn a bit more about the history of the city and it's landmarks though, and while the guides lack the humour and showmanship of their ghost walk competitors, I have to admire their knowledge and interest in their work.\n\nIt gets a bit awkward at the end when the guide goes cap in hand and sacrifices their dignity to beg for tips. A fiver is fair enough, but I literally couldn't believe the nerve of a few charlatans who tossed shrapnel at the poor girl as if she were a beggar. She sort of was, but that isn't the point. I seriously hope this isn't the only money these people get, as a few coins a day doesn't go too far round about here.",3
"We are LV locals and have gone to the steakhouse before and had a great experience. We made a reservation for tonight to celebrate our anniversary which I mentioned when I made the reservation and did not have that great a dinner. First we were seated in a small corner table near the stairs, second my french onion soup had a large piece of onion skin ( the peel from the outside of the onion) in it and when I mentioned it to two people my waitress and the floor manager all I got was oh well it happens sometimes, my steak and sweet potato fries were cold. The only good thing was the desert we had the blondie. If we go again we will insist on a better table and hope the food is better. Oh and some guy was wearing a baseball cap in the dining room and he was not a youngster as well as giving golf swing lessons while dinning.",1
"By looking at the outside, you wouldn't know this \""diamond\"" was tucked inside this old shopping mall. once inside, the space is small and close together, with tables of large groups making it hard for the wait staff to get around, but no worries, the service is excellent as is the food.\n\nWe started with a couple of apps, first up were the fried chicken wings, crispy not greasy, with a tasty dipping sauce.  Then came the grilled meatballs.  They were a bit chewy, but had a spiciness to them I liked.\n\nFor our main entrees we got several, Chicken chili mint, which had minced garlic, chill peppers and fresh mint leaves.  This was excellent!  Next we tried the Pad Thai noodle with shrimp, the rice noodle stir fired with egg, bean sprouts, green onions and ground peanuts always one of my favorites.  We also love a good curry and this time we tried the Beef Panang.\n\nWe finished off the meal with a  little desert, something that was new for them to serve tonight, Taro ball in coconut cream.  Um good!  Nothing would prevent me from coming back again, this place is excellent all around.  It can be a bit busy, so if you come there maybe a wait, but it's worth it.",4
"Sorry we were so looking forward to eating here as we have visited their other location & loved the food, unfortunately after a 40 min wait & still no food we along with other patrons asked for a refund & left. Not sure what's going on here as we watched the kitchen help through the window & they appeared untrained confused & clueless. Not sure if the chef quit & they were trying to improvise but I've never had to leave a restaurant hungry. So sad",0
"Those who know me know how much I love bread (I've been known to eat a whole plain baguette as a snack!), and, as a result, what a bread snob I can be. I guess growing up in France does that to you...\n\nOne of my coworkers recommended Mirabelle, claiming that their bread and croissants are the best she's had outside of France... Needless to say I did not believe her, but I decided to check it out nonetheless. \n\nThe verdict: their baked goods are pretty damn good! I got a baguette and a couple of croissants, and was very pleasantly surprised. The croissants were great (and I wolfed them down in no time), and the baguette was very decent. My only complaints (hence the missing star): their selection is fairly limited, and the prices are a bit steep ($2.25 for a baguette, same for a croissant... when I'm used to paying no more than a dollar in France). But I suppose I really can't complain, and I'll definitely be back.",3
"Yeah, I'm a shill and I admit that I like Starbucks.  But do me a favor and patronize 61C and Coffee Tree Roasters when you are in Squirrel Hill.  You can get a lot more ambiance at those places.",2
"This has to be one of the smallest Wine and Spirits stores in the city. This place doesn't even compare to the one in Shadyside. The wine selection is decent for the size, and the people behind the counter are always pretty nice. It's a decent place to stop in if you're in a hurry and in the area, but otherwise I would recommend going somewhere else for your liquor and wine needs.",1
"As always it depends on what you're looking for in a pizza and individual opinion.  I am all for gourmet anything, and I love pizza, so I will leave it at that.  If I was basing a review on appearance only than I would give it four stars because its clean and inviting.  The pizza's are on the smaller side and the crust is cracker like in texture and appearance which means the pizza cools off quickly, so if you're doing take out you may be eating cold pizza or reheating it at home.  I wouldn't personally call Sauce gourmet as much as trendy.  The pizza is alright but pricey for the portion you get.  Overall the place is clean and decent quality.",2
"I have been wanting to try Union Pig & Chicken for months now.  I had high expectations because I have been to Station Street Hot Dogs countless times, and have always received great service along with a good meal.  So I expected the same from Union, unfortunately It ended up being the worst restaurant experience of my life.  \n\nMy girlfriend and I went in around 8:00 on a Thursday night, It took about 10 minutes for a host to come up and give us a table,  I should have known that the rest of the night would be a lot worse.  After ordering, my girlfriend and I sat and waited, and waited, and waited some more.  Wondering what was going on we tried to get the attention of a waitress to no avail.  All the waitresses seemed much too busy running food upstairs to Harvard & Highland to stop and give us any explanation.  We noticed that we weren't the only ones not receiving our food, a group of 4 sat down after us and quickly asked how long we had been waiting for food, the answer was 50 minutes.  At this point my girlfriend and I both knew that we would never enjoy the food no matter how good it may have been after waiting that long, so we got up and left, and that was the best decision we made all night.  \n\nI will never return to this establishment.  Kevin Sousa should have started a Kickstarter Campaign to help save this restaurant, not open another one.",0
"I tried to go here for breakfast several times while staying at the Venetian this week but most days there was a line out the door.  This I assumed meant they had the best food/service around which everyone clearly knew about. What I noticed upon further inspection though was that there were over a dozen empty tables and they were simply unable to seat people fast enough to take advantage.\n\nWhen I finally did get there for breakfast I had the huevos rancheros.  The flavor was OK, but it was extremely watery.\n\nThe person who took my order wasn't my waitress and when my actual waitress came by she tried to take my order again.  I saw it happen again at another table which could have meant that one lady was poaching tables or the other was a step behind - tough to tell.\n\nAnyway, the food wasn't bad and the service was pleasant once I was seated.\n\nI would go back to try something else but there's no way I'd stand in line for 40 minutes to do so.",2
"I've only been there once & don't plan on ever going back. \nI took my nephews to Mill Ave when they were visiting, World of Beer was our first stop for a beer, we sat for about 15 minutes before anyone even acknowledged us. It was busy but it only takes a  few seconds to say \""I'll be right with you\"". \nSo after the waitress finally walked up to our table, she was clearly not a happy camper,, she had a scowl on her face & answered my question about a beer with a shitty attitude as if it wasn't her job to help me.\nWe sat there for another 10-15 minutes waiting for our beers & then just walked out before she brought them, It shouldn't take 30 minutes to get a beer but if the waitress was nice, I may have stayed. I wish I knew her name so I could give her a little friendly advice on good customer service. \nWe went across the street to the Tequila bar where the service was amazing, the staff was friendly & they have food.",1
"I was craving late night sushi a few months ago and hopped on yelp to hopefully find a place.and this is how I tried this spot. Walked in and was surprised this place was so busy but was excited since that usually means its good. I was by myself so I sat at the bar. I was greeted by 3 very friendly sushi chefs. This is the reason I keep coming back. The sushi chefs are always inviting and will help you with any questions you have!they are awesome! The sushi quality is pretty good as well!always super fresh tasting and so much variety!now for the reasons I give only 3 stars. the first time I dined there, I was charge $2.75 for soda WATER....that's just tap water with bubbles.never in my 12 years of being in the service industry have I ever Been charged or charged a Customer for tap water with some C02. When I asked the manager he had no explanation for me and said \""yeah it's just like that and there's a charged for it.\"" Now if I was the manager of a nice sushi Resturant I would respond with \""yes ma'm there is a charge for water with bubbles here but since it's your first time and you didn't know I would be happy to make an exception and remove it off your bill this time\"" whatever dude my bellys fool of delicious sushi. and I'm not in the mood to end my night poorly over some bubbles.....I'll just order regular tap next time....last thing is I've been to this place at least 4 times now and only last night was I asked if I had an AYCE stamp card....ummm no I don't because I was never asked in the first place....the servers need to communicate with eachother more and I think the manager needs some tips on hospitality.....",2
"Avalanche is king of the hill when it comes to independent music stores.\n\nPeople flock to this store to fulfill their need for digging out new, obscure music. By obscure I don't mean fashionably off the wall, like NME would want you to be. Avalanche are firm supporters of the Scottish music scene, right down to its core. There is a great representation of local, unsigned artists in this store, and you can pick up a number of interesting CDs from local artists. \n\nAs Lynsey said, it's a bit disappointing to see their punk section shrink considerably. But musical eras come and go in waves, so I'm sure punk will have its day again soon in some other form. For now, Avalanche is a great place to pick up some off kilter, interesting folk and alternative indie music CDs. \n\nMore recently, their place in the Scottish music scene has led to them hosting the occasional gig in their shop space. Showcasing the best of the best of local talent, their record shop is pivotal to people passionate about music and much loved by the Scottish music community.",3
"The kinda crappy thing about being under 24 with no real reason to ever get dressed up in Vegas is that all these incredibly huge and elaborate casino malls sort of cater to a more fancy and less casual shopper. Whether it's t-shirts, jeans or shoes, Fashion show has some really great shops for casual attire. Also there's a Chipotle, I like Chipotle",3
I knew something tasted funny when I ate here I forgot to write a review but I got food poisoning from the Kalbi in December just be careful what u order here I definitely will  ever go back!!!!,0

"If you're looking for a nice steak house, off the strip, this is a place to try out. I have been here a couple times on the recommendation of some friends that love food, and it does not disappoint. Their steaks are juicy and very tasty! Add on some of the different salts they provide to give it some extra taste. For a side dish, I always get the creamed corn here. Their breads that they server are also really good! Apparantly they get them from a local bakery. There's one with small chocolate chips in it...yum! \nThe couple times I have been here, it's not been very crowded. Not sure why not, the food is great! Definitely check out restaurants.com for discounted dining certificates here.",4
"Found Jimmy's on Yelp! and it did not disappoint, Jimmy was able to sneak me without an appointment and did an excellent job cutting my hair. Everything was on par with all of the other reviews. Even the offer of a cold bottle of water while I waited. I asked Jimmy how many barbers worked there and he said \""just one, me!\"" That seemed strange to only have one barber until he told me why. He explained that he does not want a single person walking out of a shop with his name on the front dissatisfied,  so he prefers to do every cut personally himself. He takes pride in his work and it shows. In my opinion, you don't see that enough these days. Very relaxed and comfortable environment. Jimmy and his wife are very personable and pleasant. Not to mention very reasonably priced....... Looks like I finally found a barber!",4
"HealthNet has THE WORST customer service I have ever experienced.... not just with Insurance providers, but overall. \n\nI think their \""Escalation Department\"" is a circular waste basket. When a customer service rep tells you that they are going to take personal ownership of your issue because it is so messed up on their part, don't believe them. They apparently couldn't care less. I begged them to take my first premium payment so I could be enrolled.\n\nI doubt they will take accountability for their incompetence now that open enrollment is closed. Thanks HealthNet! I'll pass my correspondence records on to ObamaCare.",0
"I need to explain - I was invited to go here as a birthday present. The Duchess of The Cholas Tanja R was very convincing that I (as non enthousiast of Indian Food) would find this place as wonderful as she does. Especially the dosas.\n\nAnita A. called ahead to advise we were bringing our own dessert - which was no problem (+1 Star)\n\nSo in a group of 6 we arrived at around 19:30 (you see where this is going - as I mention an arrival time) We were seated and I took a good look around the place. \n\nAn elongated place with dark wooden tables on either side  and a dispensing bar/order section in the back on the way to the kitchen.\nI was hoping to elaborate on the atmosphere, but there was none. No decoration of note - OK I lied, they used those shiny metallic wrapping stars you use on presents.. on the wall.. about 8 of them evenly spaced over the place. \n\nThe table decoration was nicely done with the actual only bright colour in the place. Tanja R was warmly greeted by the owner / manager and was assured tonight was going to be a blast! \n\nThat was a serious overstatement. \nI will not go in to many details but I mentioned the time of arrival and after ordering (he made a really clear show of repeating every ordered dish back to us)  and awaiting our starters,  we eventually got our starters at 20:45 WTaF?!  - We became a bit worried about what and why it took so long. As they kept forgetting water we asked for twice, and my beer had to be reordered too. \nEvident ally they were busy. However a table of 3 that arrived about half hour after us got starters at the same time as us! \n\nI was again assured by Menno V. Tanja R. and Anita A. that they had just recently opened and this is just unusual - however that statement was on shaky ground. When the main courses arrived (fairly swift after the starters) they managed to not serve mine.. I got the rice, but no main. I shared the meal of others. We did ask where my meal was an he said he was going to check and reorder. However we were thus far that all of the other diners already finished and my rice was also about gone - we cancelled my main meal, my birthday meal! Not impressed. I had to eat from other plates to have a meal on my birthday.. seriously. \nFair does to the taste though as all the food we did have was very flavourful. (+1 Star) But it would have been nice to actually have my own meal. \nThe Tiramisu that Anita made was very nice. \n\nLittle in apologies was supplied and they actually put the missing dish on the bill.. at this point I started doubting the previous rating for Cholas of my fellow diners who even at this point still half heartily defended the place. \n\nAnother disappointment was the toilet. Beside not being very clean, I was just washing my hands and hand dryer didn't work. (Yes Menno V. I did try to use the on switch) No paper towels, so I resorted to toilet paper, and the holder fell off the wall and onto the floor.. I tried placing it back. Didn't fit. Afterwards when going again it was back in place and at the first tuck it fell off again. \n\nSo they kept telling that this place just opened and they are usually not busy. Well when 5 star reviews are set you better get used to being busy. And now with the fringe in town - people will look for good places to eat and look at that all important star rating. \n\nEven Tanja R & Anita A had to advise the owner/manager that they will have to avoid going here during the Fringe as they are not looking to repeat this experience. \n\nIf they don't get their act together, my  review may not be the only one of its kind, but many more will follow!\n\nI was so disappointed that due to all this waiting to get food - the whole evening was about over when we finished eating and we were too tired, too full (and miffed) to do anything else - well I did anyway. So home wards it was. \n\nIt should've been so nice - and I was pleased to have my good friends with me. But any other place would've likely been a better experience.",1

"There's a reason why some places are on Check Please Arizona (Lo Lo's) and others are on Groupon.\n\nThe sad thing is that I think this place is not far off from being REALLY good.  The interior is nicely designed, but it could really use a good clean.\n\nThe girl at the counter was not exactly the friendliest.  I think she has lost her passion for the work.\n\nThe food was painfully average.  The chicken could have been crispier on the outside and juicier on the inside.  The waffle was pretty bad.  I think they just put pancake batter in a waffle iron (which is what I think Lo Lo's does too, and it drives me crazy).  The mac and cheese was pretty decent.\n\nThe other weird thing is that they have signs outside that mentions all sorts of dishes that they do not mention on the menu indoors.  WTH?\n\nReally though - if they could do the chicken better (it's not rocket science - there are plenty of places across the country that manage to do a decent friend chicken) and tidy up the place a bit, they could be well on their way to having an outstanding place.",1
"We needed a place to board our 3YO Shih Tzu when we went on vacation.  Our friends couldn't take him so we had to resort to placing him in Preppy Pets.  We visited the place before making a decision and it seemed OK to us however, we never had to board our dog before so aren't exactly experts on the subject.  We did notice that it smelled pretty bad but presumed that to be normal.\n\nWhen we dropped off our dog we informed the staff that he needed groomed (requested puppy cut, be sure to cut between nails, trim ear hair and trim nails).  We left dog food and rawhide bone and his bed (which was nearly brand new) with him.  We also informed the staff that he doesn't like to play with other dogs.\n\nWhen we picked him up the groomer came out to see us and stated that there was a note stating that he bites and that she wasn't sure how short to cut his hair because \""Puppy Cut\"" means different things to different people.  Other groomers we have used seem to understand what a Puppy Cut is but apparently not this lady.  I was surprised at the note about biting because he is a very friendly dog and has never bitten anyone in his life.  If he is \""pushed into a corner\"" he will put up a fuss but has never bit anybody.\n\nI was disappointed with the grooming - they hardly cut anything off.  They didn't trim most of his nails and didn't file them at all.  They didn't trim the hair between his toes or trim his ear-hair.  He had a lot of hair trimming all over him so apparently  he was not brushed or washed after his grooming.  Finally, he had orange colored stuff all over his butt - not sure what, perhaps poop or something else.  He got a shower as soon as he got home.\n\nHis nearly new dog bed was FILTHY.  There were hairs all over it (Shih Tzu dogs do not shed, they have human-like hair).  There was some other white sticky fuzzy stuff all over the bed as well.  The filth wasn't just inside his bed the outside was equally filthy....  The bed is in the garbage now.\n\n After showering him, we found that he has a lot of little red spots on his ears.  We don't know from what but it looks like numerous small insect bites.\n\nNeedless to say, I will NEVER, EVER take our dog to that place again.\n\nThe positives are that the price is low and the staff was always friendly (even though the groomer lady was a bit odd).",0

Don't bother with upgrading past the luxury manicure. Not worth it! I went with two friends and they got the luxury and I got the deluxe. No difference! The owner tried telling me that I got a longer massage which is a lie because we all were done together. They also rush a lot more when they have customers waiting. I get different service every time. The gal who did my mani/pedi was very nice.,0
"Damnit! They did it to me again!  I drive in for a simple car wash and end up with more dings on my fenders than Armor All on my tires!  When I brought it up, they dragged nearly every employee on the premises over to my car to take a look. Then one by one they all got Idiot's Amnesia.  Even the bonehead who I watched drive my car up to the conveyor denied he was even in my car! \n\nAs I stood there pointing out the fresh scratches with the paint color that perfectly matched the jagged block wall of their drive path, they all went dumb!\n\nMy first experience with this type of senseless customer service at Danny's was a few years back. A manager was pulling my car up to the drying area at a high rate of speed, and I actually watched him sideswipe another vehicle with my car. When I confronted him, and pointed out the fresh patch of rubber rash on my fender from the hit, he denied it...and guess what? He suddenly got that exact same case of Danny's Family Carwash Idiot's Amnesia. Luckily for me I was able to get the rubber patch off so I didn't need to follow up. \n\nAfter a recent statewide bust for hiring illegal workers -- TWICE -- you'd figure these morons at Danny's would be a little more willing to curb their bad behaviors and be a lot more customer centric. \n\nWhen Danny's Dysfunctional Family Carwash starts offering body and fender repair services along with their mediocre car washes... customers beware!",0
"If this place invented the pulled pork parfait....they should be given an award! This place is also kind of cafeteria style. Grab a tray and step up to the meat counter. There are plenty of meat-tastic items to choose from. I sampled the brisket after a pal ordered it and loved it. \nObviously I ordered the parfait. Two types of beans to choose from. I went with the more country style, not the jalape\u00f1o ones, but only bc I'm more of a country beans type of gal. Next up, potato layer...3 types of potatoes to choose from! Red potato wedges, garlic mashed and some froofy spinach mashed potato. I went with the classic red wedge. The others looked great I just wanted the potato as a whole piece instead of mashed. Finally, this masterpiece is topped with pulled pork. Mmmmm! I sauced this guy at the table myself. I love both of their sauce options, one spicy, one a tad more sweet and classic. \n\nGreat happy hour bottled beer special til 6, I think! Great apple and cherry pie. Peach cobbler....yum!\n\nI will definitely be back! I have the other half of my groupon to use!",4

Real nice guys but I was hopping they could have temporarily stopped the oil leak like they did before when their guy f*ed it up.

"Am I that out of sync with other Yelp reviewers, or is someone planting reviews?  Or, how many of the 4- and 5-star reviews were written by people who stayed there for free? Unlike many other reviewers, we paid more than $500 for two nights this week, and we were extremely disappointed.\n\nIf you're thinking of staying there and you are the one paying the bill, you should know:\n\nThey charged my card as soon as I made the reservation.\n\nThe lobby is loud and chilly. To get to our room, we had a long walk through the casino (also very cold all the time) to the elevator and another long, icy walk to the room. The first key cards we got didn't work.\n\nThe room had used dental floss on the floor and a used band-aid next to the bed. We complained to housekeeping and were told, \""I'm sorry. Do you need anything else?\""\n\nWe couldn't use the fridge because it was crammed full of their stuff for sale. There was a display in front of the TV of those small, $9 boxes of snacks sitting on sensors so they can charge you automatically if you pick one up. We knew better than to pick them up, but one of the spots was already empty! We told the front desk, and so far we haven't been billed for it.\n\nThey had signs in the room saying they wouldn't change the bed every day so they could save water--but the toilet ran the whole time we were there. Also, there was no exhaust fan in the bathroom.\n\nThe view was of roofs and backs of buildings.\n\nA sign on the desk said Internet access was $12.95 a day.\n\nThe \""$150 in resort extras\"" we got  were 2-for-1 drink coupons and 20% off restaurant & spa coupons, none of which we were interested in using.\n\nI'm serious--an $80-100 a night Best Western or Comfort Inn would have been far more comfortable--we'd have been able to park near the room, it would have been clean, we could have used the fridge, we wouldn't have to worry about being charged for snacks by mistake, and we would have had free Internet access and breakfast.",0
This show was ...o..k...at the most...there's not a lot of acrobatics like the other shows...not a lot of actions....I would recommend another show from Cirque Du Soleil...,1
"Absolutely. Terrible. \n\nIt took 2 hours to get our food, our server was rude and non-communicative. Apparently the computer system was down and the kitchen was backed up - how that explains a surly server I'll never know. Also, how it explains a luke warm mimosa I don't know either. \n\nBleh. Don't waste your time.",0
"We ate lunch here on our last day since it was in our hotel.\n\nThe $2 oysters were a great deal & really good. We split a roasted turkey sandwich from the \""carvery\"" section. It was hands-down one of the best sandwiches I've ever eaten. The turkey was absolutely delicious. \n\nI'd give this place more stars if it weren't for the service. We sat outside & had 4 different waiters during our 40 minute lunch. It was a little bizarre. We also ordered sweet potato fries that were unfortunately forgotten about. \n\nPrices were very reasonable & I'd probably come back if I stayed in the area again.",2
Pumi's ok. The greeter was cool. I think he was the chef. I didn't like the dark ambiance. Service was not that great. Was a lil slow than usual. Food portion was not as gd as Sushi Bay. I prefer Sushi Bay.,1
"Great local nutrition store, prefer to shop here instead of GNC or Vitamin Shop . Owner will match prices and will get you a supplement if he can if he doesn't carry it. The staff is knowledgeable and friendly .",3
"Nice cafe, solid location (right by both Pitt and CMU campuses), consistent wi-fi (sometimes a bit slow), and a nice atmosphere for sitting around all day with that rich coffee smell all over your clothes.\n\nThe coffee isn't the best, but it's a great place to spend time. If you're looking for delicious coffee and a smiling staff, you'll be severely disappointed--welcome to Pittsburgh. But, regardless, I still love it at Kiva Han.\n\nI usually go back about once every other week to enjoy a cheap eat (the macaroni and cheese is caked with cheese and paprika, the wagon wheels are delicious, the penne pasta is just as good). Everything comes out fresh and light, and they call your name with the order--also, the iced tea is by far my favorite unsweetened iced tea in Pittsburgh.\n\nIt might sound weird, but check out the bathrooms. They're filled with art and writing all over the walls that you'd expect to find in coffee shop bathrooms (but don't happen at the large chains that plague the rest of the Oakland area).\n\nCome with a friend or two, read a book, poke fun at some of the artwork, people watch all day.",2
"OK, Sushi Room - you are killing me.  I keep coming back because I really do like your sushi, but could you at least provide the same experience two times in a row?  It is getting a bit ridiculous.  One of the best things about this place is that they have incredible specials, good happy hour deals and great food.  However, when you have a special posted on BOTH your website and the front door of your restaurant and then don't honor it, you're going to irritate a loyal customer like myself.  My husband and I were in last night 4/23/13, that is a Tuesday and on Tuesday you are supposed to get 2 rolls and a large sake for $20 - at least according to your website and the specials listed on the door, however when we inquired about it, our server not only said it didn't exist he denied that it was ever available.  Ummmmm, I'm sorry. I offered to pull up the deal online via my smart phone and that must have irritated him because we were then ignored for at least 30 minutes.  So yeah, I think we're going to have to take a break.  While your food is good, it isn't worth the hassle. \n\nFYI - here's the website special that doesn't exist: http://sushiroomaz.com/specials.html",0
I set an appointment and they forgot about me.  Sucks to wait and get blown off.  No call...nothing.,0
This is the best Hotel resort without a casino in Vegas. The Hotel is very new about a year old when we visited and very modern. The staff was very polite and helpful. There is not smoking in the hotel and also not casino so the hotel has a very relaxed  atmosphere. Their is a free 24hr rail service to take you to the strip within a few min when you are ready for Vegas. The spa was very nice (but pricy) my wife and I enjoyed our couples massages. The pool area is very relaxing and not overcrowded like some of the hotels on the strip.  I will be returning. \n(FYI this is a time share style resort so they charge a resort fee per night if you are not an owner),4
"I was torn between 2 and 3 stars, but then I thought about our overall experience and two it is. \n\nThe salsa (one red) served at the start of the meal was just ok but the chips were fresh and still warm. \nIt's a positive two for the guacamole.THAT, I know for sure. Their guac is more of a creamy base with smashed tomatoes and bits (slivers) of onions,combined with some(read very little) avocado used just to make it seem green as guacamole should. \n\nThe color green was very sad. I have had some great guac (shout out to Cantina and La Unica!) and it was a happy vibrant color of green. This sad muted green was on the other end of the rainbow. \n\nThe fajitas were pretty good with nicely marinated chicken BUT they are served with no lime wedges.I used the left over lime from my Corona, which we (all four) thought they tasted flat out of the bottle? And were not very cold. The Chicken enchiladas were good. \n\nThe server had to take a few moments in-between placing our order and asking questions about the menu etc. as if she was just learning English. She tripped up a few times but she was trying hard. \n\nAfter the big disappointment of a take out from one of my *former* favorites this was actually very good, which does not say much. \n\nThere are is another Charlotte location and two in Gastonia but I won't be rushing to any of them. Most likely not giving this another shot either. \nIf I am in the area I'll go next door to Nona's Sweets . OoPppS, scratch that.  I'll drive the 1/2 mile down the block to her new location and fill up on Italian nummies.",1
"This place isn't a that great.  Sure, they have a beer special after 9 p.m. but no one goes here for drinks.  They're burgers are terrible.  The drinks are okay, but considering the price, they aren't that good.  I hear the salads are good since I never tried them myself.  The service is mediocre and the restaurant is just average.  I would advice just going to Chili's across the street.",1

Il y avait une file d'attente assez longue et on a attendu \u00e0 peu pr\u00e8s 25-30 minutes.\n\nLe d\u00e9cor est assez original et ils ont une grande salle \u00e0 manger avec des bancs/canap\u00e9 au long des murs et des tables pour 2/4 personnes au milieu de la salle. La musique \u00e9tait un peu trop fort pour mon go\u00fbt par contre. \n\nAttention! Touts les plats sur le menu ne sont pas disponible en tout temps. Il y a des plats qu'on ne peut commander que le soir (par exemple le filet saumon grill\u00e9, les steaks etc.) mais ce n'est pas marqu\u00e9 sur le menu ni les serveurs vous l'indiquent.\n\nNous avons command\u00e9 une omelette et une salade saumon/fromage de ch\u00e8vre.

Came in for a pedicure... a great way to have use of the spa but not pay crazy money ... Jennifer was a sweetheart and made my toes look fab!,3
"This location is extremely slow, the order is usually wrong, and the food taste old. They obviously don't change their fryer oil often enough. They also need to find a better way to count their tills. I don't have 15 minutes in the morning to sit at a window and wait. I would skip this place. There are better ones around.",1
Obviously it's a buffet so they use very very low quality ingredients I can't imagine anything being worse than this in terms of Chinese food.,0
"I really enjoyed the medium-rare rib eye as it was seasoned and cooked to perfection, but what I enjoyed even more were the pork chops!  Bone in tender chops cooked barely pink covered in a delicious, light sauce.  I'm getting moist just thinking about it.",4
"A friend and I decided to try this place after all the good reviews we read and it was awesome food. We started with the stuffed grape leaves which there were six of them and very tasty. Then we shared the gyros, chicken and beef kabob combination plate which serves two and came with a big plate of rice. All I can say is we were in heaven while eating this..everything was cooked and seasoned perfectly. We had a little rice and gyros leftover so the waitress packaged it up and filled the to go box with rice and extra sauce and pita..which came out to a full meal in itself. The place is a little small but filled up quickly and service was friendly and we never had to ask for anything. If your craving Greek food treat yourself to Eden's",4
"With the new Update I can finally post this review that I wrote months ago and has been sitting in my Drafts, but as a Note we have been to Salo-Salo Grill a few times before and had lackluster experiences, this last experience in particular had forced me to share it with the rest of you. Mother's Day 2013: When we were sat down they said they Ran Out of Menus...I have Never been to a Restaurant where they Ran out of Menus, and it's not like this place sat Everybody all at the Same time. We waited a good 10 minutes before we even received one. My wife really wanted Filipino Breakfast, well their \""All Day Breakfast\"" was Not Available, however we could still order the Longanisa separately, and then the Garlic Rice, but when we were ordering the Eggs they said they weren't cooking Eggs today, ugh! The Lack of communication is unbelievable in this place, especially one that advertises in their Menu with \""All Day Breakfast\"". It's Freakin' Mother's Day for goodness sakes, Brunch is the Traditional Meal for Mother's Day, WTF?!?! Sadly we don't know any other Filipino Restaurants in Vegas that offer dishes like Log-Silog, Tap-Silog, etc. Things like this make me miss Daly City a lot! If ante does know any places in LV that do, Please let me know! Thanks for reading.",0
"Better than some reviews.  Guess it depends on the night.  Went late evening after kayaking on the river.  Sat outside and waited....Waitresses both thought it was the other's table.  After that, service was good.  Was crowded.  Had the crab cake sandwich, which was pretty good...better than I expected from this type of establishment and not to much breading.  Pizza was good, the pasta dish was OK.  Beer not draft//why??? Wines were below par//Why???  Was pleasantly surprised!",2
"My review is for the Service Department.  \n\nI took my Contour here because my transmission suddenly started leaking fluid.  The service writer at Friendly Ford said my transmission was shot and that I needed to fork over $2,000 to replace it.  Fortunately, I decided to call Aamco for a second opinion.  It turned out a vent hose for the transmission had gotten kinked when my battery was replaced.  Aamco didn't even charge me because he found the problem as soon as he opened the hood!  I would never trust Friendly Ford with my car again.",0
"I really love everything that's going on around East Fremont; with all of the new bars and restaurants the scene is really coming together. But along with all those new venues comes droves of hipsters almost as intolerable to me as the droves of tourists on the Strip, so I tend to visit this area during the day for lunch and weeknights. My impatience aside, the downtown area needs great food to go with its great bars, so I was very excited to hear that the new Park on Fremont was going to be serving more than just snacks. Billed as a gastro-pub, this recently abused word suggests a fancy array of snacks and main dishes to go along with a large drink menu. But can this suggestion truly become a reality?\n\nPark has recently opened, taking over the failed 18+ hookah lounge that was there previously in a prime location on the corner of East Fremont and Las Vegas Blvd. It sits alongside another neighborhood newcomer Radio City Pizza, and all of the other popular First Friday spots that have quickly taken over the scene with long pretentious lines to get in. I hate waiting to get in to places on the Strip, this new development of ropes and lines on Fremont is a bit much, even as 'cool' as some of these places might be. The interior of Park is quite odd, and I'm not quite sure how to explain it. Striking wall coverings, cool art, and stuffed birds decorate the interior dining and bar area, with a small patio up front and a large outdoor 'park' in the back complete with an adult teeter totter and plenty of lights. I went during the day so the inside was more than fine, although I'm sure the outdoor area in the back looks much better at night. While their menu has some interesting sounding items, it's kind of all over the place and I've heard most sound better than they actually taste. Options like a fried chicken and waffle sandwich, Philly mac and cheese steak and a corned beef Reuben all sound tasty, if not unhealthy.\n\nEither way, I'm not here to report second hand information, I'm here to tell you about my burger experience. And in this case, it's their stuffed burger with Monterey jack and cheddar, and applewood bacon. Upon picking it up I bit into my dry bun with a really cold spot in the center where the pickles were sitting. What's with all the cold buns lately? The meat had no decent flavor on its own; it wasn't bad but it wasn't seasoned or presumably anything special. There was surprisingly some pink to the meat, which is a rare sight for a stuffed burger given how much longer they usually have to be cooked, although given the unknown quality of the meat I'm not sure if this is a good thing. The bacon inside was soggy and took away from any cheese or onion flavors, which weren't anything too great either. The lettuce, tomato and onion on top were fresh and ok, but overall there was nothing special about this burger which was surprisingly dry despite being stuffed with so much.\n\nThe fries were nothing special either; of the larger cut variety, but soggy and barely at room temperature. It seems like the reports I've heard are true: everything here looks way better than it actually is, which is surely unfortunate as I really want everything that opens in this particular area to be great. Still, I'm sure it will do just fine as this food is probably more than acceptable for the drunk crowd that takes over East Fremont all weekend. Just not for the overly critical like myself. $12 for a stuffed burger and fries is a reasonable price, I just wouldn't recommend it when you have better options close by at Triple George and newly opened La Comida (review for their really good burger coming next week).",1
"I have been to see MANY shows over the years at Ak Chin (as well as under it's many other name incarnations...) This summer, we saw Alice Cooper/Motley Crue and Kiss/Def Leppard this summer at Ak Chin. Frankly, it's not my favorite place to see a show but it has it's old school charm.  \n\nFirst, it's an outdoor amphitheater,which is fine, but because it's outdoors that apparently means open season for smokers and their various items of choice. We stood next to a group that chain smoked through Kiss like it was the last cigarettes they would ever smoke. The contact high I got during Motley Crue nearly rendered me unable to drive. That said--the people watching is second to none. You will not be disappointed at the various characters who \n\nNow because this is an older facility, the sound  and production can be hit or miss. The sound during Alice Cooper was horrible. It was hard to hear, the sound cut out a few times, and the lighting looked bad. That said, the sound and production during Motley Crue was excellent--and you could tell that being backed by Dodge for their corporate sponsorship means they had some super high tech professional peeps on the tour with them. The difference was quite noticeable.\n\nThe prices for drinks and noshes were a bit on the high side but I've seen worse. I think gouging people for bottled water in the middle of summer is a bit sac-religious, but that's just me. They generally don't allow cameras but check first because the website says they allow cameras without the professional lenses but I have seen them turn people away at the door with the 'approved' cameras. I think it depends on the act versus what the venue's rules might be--so again, check first. \n\nParking is free which is nice but the traffic can be a killer. I highly recommend taking surface streets and coming from the north to the south rather than coming from the freeway. It can be a real bummer otherwise as you can and likely will miss the opening act and part of the headliner if you don't time it properly.  Leaving the venue is, again, a nightmare, so I suggest taking surface streets and stay away from the freeway for a few miles.  Google map it to get an idea of what streets to utilize and please--Take my advice--surface streets are the better bet.",2
"Two words: EXCELLENT STAFF. I loved how the waiters were so professional and courteous to all of us. They gave great recommendations, joked around with us & made our dinner even more enjoyable than it already was.\n\nBouchon is Thomas Keller's hidden gem tucked on the 2nd floor of the Venetian. I highly recommend it to anyone visiting Vegas.\n\nCame here during a bachelorette party because we wanted to take the bride-to-be somewhere special. So fancy that, we found Thomas Keller's restaurant here :)\n\nAs a group, we shared the cheese plate. We weren't the biggest fan of it - maybe because some of us weren't cheese people. It was recommend by the waiter. Well if you are a cheese person, then this is the appetizer plate to get & share!\n\nI ordered the Poulet R\u00f4ti. I cannot begin to describe the savoriness of this dish. The chicken was baked soft with a crisp layer of skin covering it. Plus to be covered in that sauce & its juice was just amazing. The pears added a nice sweet touch to the dish and the mustard added a bit of spice flavoring.\n\nI will definitely be returning back here when I come back to Vegas. Delicious dinner. Great staff. Picturesque decor. Love, love, love!\n\nMake sure to make a reservation!",3
"over rated.  totally.  the hotel's unique floral arrangement area and water show are cool, but that's about it.  the rooms are up to par compared to other \""name brand\"" hotels on the las vegas strip.  the gym is really nice, but $25?  come on.  unnecessary.  it should be included considering the $399/night room charge\n\nsummary: nice to walk by and see the interior, but stay somewhere else...like the palazzo or wynn :)",2
"I would not recommend Don's to anyone.  The customer service was poor.  We schedule an repair visit and made arrangements to be there.  Don's repairman didn't show up.  We got a call at the end of the service window stating the repairman could not make it. When the showed up the next day, they didn't have the part they needed, so we had a charge for the service call that didn't fix the problem.  Then, when they had the part, they said they were coming in a  two hour window.  At the end of that window, they called and said they would be on site in 4 HOURS!!!  AND THEN THEY NEVER CAME!!!  The man answering the phone was apologetic (and suggested this was uncommon), but I seriously doubt this.  I will not call them again, and recommend Don's to nobody.",0
"The atmosphere is really nice. Prices are reasonable, the sides you get with it are meh.. ok  .. nothing to get excited about.\n\nService is terrible. The waitress was really rude, got all of our drink orders wrong, and took forever to bring out water. Our bill was a total mess. I think we spent more time trying to figure it out then we did eating. Tried to explain how much to charge on each credit card, and she kept cutting me off and was completely rude.\n\nYou are better off going to a buffet that serves Prime Rib and you get a better selection on sides for the price you pay.",1
"Worst food I've ever eaten. The \""Crispy Fried Tofu\"" was anything but. It was soggy, mushy, fell apart and just plain gross. It was barely cooked, or deep fried enough at all. The \""HongKong Style Wonton Noodle\"" soup had very little flavor. The noodles in the soup were a bit hard. The noodle soup also smelled of some sort of chemical, as if it were formaldehyde or something. I also did not receive the steamed rice that I was supposed to get with my order. I ordered my food to go. I don't live so close so it wasn't worth me returning back to the store. I ended up throwing it all out. A total waste of $17 and some change. I don't like to post bad reviews much, even when I receive bad service. I tend to focus on the positive, and try to give the benefit of the doubt. However, I couldn't help but post about my experience and the quality of the food. I'm still trying to get the horrific after taste out of my mouth, just from the little I tasted. I've been to many different Chinese and Asian restaurants around town, and I'm not the pickiest of eaters. This place has to be the very worst that I've ever come across. I would not recommend it at all.",0
"Eating here was a bit of a let-down for me, as I am used to the most delicious food and superb service in Vegas. I've been to my share of the \""pubs\"" in town, most notably the pubs by Todd English and Michael Mina, and was expecting a similar experience. \n\nThe drinks were delicious, most notably the Pub's version of a Moscow Mule, but my food was mediocre at best. Perhaps I ordered something really random in the Pub's version of Butter Chicken with basmati rice, but the sauce was bland and way too peppery at the same time. The rice was tender and well-cooked, but so drenched in butter that it appeared yellow. Other friends ordered fish and chips, the pea soup, the sliders, and fries. The fries were soggy and limp, which was a huge letdown. Everything was else was fine, just nothing to write home about.\n\nThe atmosphere is fun, but that was probably the best part.",2
"This is a shop that makes its money out of its location, it would never survive if it was on a high street as it would not be able to compete with the 'big boys' like Tesco's and Sansbury's as its prices are just too expensive. \nHowever, if you live in the Polwarth area, there is no big supermarket in short walking distance and so Santangeli are able to attract the local residents. The shop does actually have quite a surprisingly broad range of products in it and will be no doubt of huge convenience to thoise who live in the local area. \nAs Emma correctly says, it is exactly like the Margiotta shops that you find in central Edinburgh, but without the annoying classical music that they play and a greater range of products.",2
"I was sorta unimpressed.  I have been to many of these strip mall nail joints, and know what to expect.  However, I would not return to this one.  It is way out of my bubble of safe places to go to (within a certain distance from my house or various other places I run errands) but I was on that side of town and needed my Gelish nails redone.\n\nThe place was dirty, I don't mean maggots and moldy food dirty, just a lot of nail dust, dust and general untidiness.  It was the end of the day, so I can forgive it (but it was clearly not from just one day)\n\nThe tools weren't taken out of individual pouches like I am used to and just looked sketchy. But since she wasn't clipping cuticles, since that isn't in their gelish application like it is at C&N where I was going before, I wasn't too worried.  \n\nThe other problem was there weren't using the Official Gelish products. They used the colors, but not the base, or the cleaner like most places do.  \n\nMy Gelish also lifted super fast.  It doesn't last long for me anyways, but this one was the fastet lift ever.  I gave up on Gelish after.  \n\nI hate giving bad reviews.  Please forgive me!  \n\nOH! And I paid a lot more there than I did at C&N for less of a service.",1
"I love Wicked Spoon!\n\nThey have a lot of unique dishes! I love the fact that a lot of the dishes were portioned out smaller, so I was able to try everything without getting super full! \n\nThe bone marrow was awesome, just melted in my mouth. The little chinese take out boxes were not only delicious, but incredibly cute!! The fried chicken was pretty good and came in a little basket. My favorite was the dessert! They had my favorite, macaroons! And chocolate molten lava cake! Everything was DELICIOUS!\n\nThe service was great and we were seated super close to the food! We did wait in line for a little while, but worth the wait. \n\nCan't wait to return! Next week maybe? :D",3
"My family loves this place but I've had a couple of bad experiences. It's either really good or really bad. The garlic salad is amazing and their onion soup is out of this world. Their crepes can go both ways (and I only order nutella/chocolate banana so that says A LOT). \n\nOnce went in and they were out of bananas, strawberries, and shrimp. So I ordered nutella/chocolate apple instead of my usual which was very disappointing. I opened up my heated apple and chocolate crepe and found a SAUSAGE link inside. Quite disgusting, really.\n\nMy sister usually orders their shrimp plate, but since they were out - literally went next door for sushi as everything else she wanted was out of stock. \n\nExpect the worst or the best, it's really a toss up!",2
"I love Pita Jungle every time I eat here the food is fresh and fantastic.  I do however have to give 3 stars much to my dismay EVERY time I sit down to eat the service sucks.  It's usually slow and the last waitress we had kept forgetting to refill drinks and that's just annoying.  I have no beef with the chef but they need to upgrade the service one more star for me.  Don't just do the minimum, please!",2
"This place is the worst!!! We got take out from here last night and our food was undercooked and very greasy. It also did not smell too good either... won't be going here again... should have listened to my sister who said \""eww\"" when I told her we were ordering from this place.",0
Great in and out!  I have been to a few airports but this is well set up.,3
Fantastic. Shrimp creole was great. So was the chicken and sausage gumbo. I will be coming back.,4
I went to the Earl's inside the Palms rather than this one because the line here is SO long I recommend taking the trip to Palms for no wait at all. I had the Italian sandwich and boy was it amazing. The toasted bread was perfect not too hard or soft. The sandwich was packed with flavor. I have had a lot of sandwiches in my day and this had to be the best. Grab some to take home before you leave Vegas and throw them in a toaster oven when you get home.. trust me!,4
"I was extremely surprised at the customer service we recently encompassed at this Best Buy.  Yes, their prices are high but they really have stepped up their game with offering price match and price guarantee.  They were able to match online prices with most of our purchases saving us more than $240.  For some items, their price was the lowest, leaving me astounded. They also offer a 30 day period for the price guarantee and return/exchange policy.  \n\nWe spent a great amount of time in this store and our sales associate who also checked us out was unquestionably patient with us.  She was knowledgeable in the department she is in.  We  visited several departments throughout the store and I have to say their customer service is indeed impeccable.  There is always someone there to help you.  \n\nThe only downside I have with this store is having to wait in line at customer service.  There's usually 1 or 2 people behind those counters and it takes such a long time before you are even helped.  \n\nThey are located on S Rainbow and 215 at the Arroyo Crossing Shopping Plaza with ample and easy parking.",4
"Nothing outstanding here. Portions are a good size. Lots of variety to choice from. Staff doesn't seem to leave behind the counter. There's a small salsa bar but nothing to fuss about. I've had the fish tacos which were a little bland. Same for the chicken burritos, not much flavor. Not sure why I expected this place to be good, bigger menu than del taco but not much on taste. If you're hungry and need a quick bite I guess it'll do.",1
"Tried this new restaurant in the neighborhood (3/24/14).  Found it to be clean with nice wait staff and pleasant environment.  I felt that the menu was not as broad as you would expect in a \""seafood\"" restaurant.  We ordered shrimp cocktail for a high price of $15 which consisted of five overcooked rubbery large shrimp.  I ordered the \""King\"" steam pot which tasted good, but consisted of mostly pasta and a nice sauce.  The menu indicates crab \""legs\"" are included, but I only got one very small one.  All in all, it was a disappointment, and way overpriced at $25.00.  My guest ordered the Gumbo which was pretty good, but still overpriced.    \n\nThe owner needs to add some other fish items to menu and pick a lower price point, otherwise, you won't be in business very long in that location!",0
This Bank of America location is just okay. I go here for both personal and merchant banking and it frustrates me that on the lunch hour they only have two bankers windows open. Today I waited for at least fifteen minutes with only one person in line a head of me because all of the merchants were dropping deposits and of course it was taking a very long time to count them through. The banker at the counter was very nice and made nice conversation with me but this location needs to be more efficient.,2
"Honestly, there was little that was memorable or interesting about our dinner here last Friday. The food is solid, but overly salty (my tongue was swollen the next morning) and verged on boring.",1
"My husband and I came here for our anniversary dinner after buying a Groupon. I was a little concerned because of the negative reviews, but I was very pleasantly surprised! \n\n   The staff is very nice, very accommodating,  and always nearby when needed. Our waiter, Jos\u00e9,  was awesome! \n \n  The complimentary black bean and chipotle hummus is sooooo good! We started with the aged meat and cheese plate. Everything was delicious. I ordered the herb roasted chicken with duck fat saut\u00e9ed Brussels sprouts and wild mushrooms. Wow! The skin on the chicken was perfectly crispy and the meat was tender and juicy. The vegetables were addictive. I could have eaten a plate full of them! My husband ordered the filet mignon with horseradish potato puree and 5 cheese creamed spinach. The filet could have been cut with a fork. It was cooked just right. We ended the meal with dessert. My husband got the strawberry shortcake with vanilla bean ice cream. Delish! I got their humongous chocolate cake. It was decadent and I ended up bringing half of it home, it was so big!\n\n   If our budget ever allows, I'd love to come back and eat again. \n\n  The ONLY gripe I have is that the seating isn't very comfortable. The atmosphere is nice and the views are beautiful, but the chairs are uncomfortable. Small matter since everything else was fantastic.",4
"This is a great poker room, not because of the people playing, not because of the low rake, not because the cards are pretty, but because the dealers have to wear the ugliest casino shirts ever.\n\nSeriously, I've spent a lot of time in this poker room...it's cheap-ish, usually has soem toolbags to take advantage of, and the dealers are friendly.  It's no Bellagio poker room, but it will do in a pinch, and it's by the pleasure pit.  Take that for whatever it's worth.  But who doesn't want pleasure, and a pit while playing poker?",2
"Was there this past weekend, wait for about an hour for a group of six\n\nService was excellent! Like honestly, our waitress was super friendly and nice\nI got the farm burger and shared Parmesan fries with my gf\nI got the farm burger with an over hard egg and it was great\nThe fries were ehh alright, wish they were cheesier or something\nBut the burger was amazing",3
"For those of you in Vegas for Capsule/Project, you MUST visit Lotus of SIam. My peoples Jae and Regina put me on to Lotus back in February. This spot is literally a diamond in the rough. Its located half a mile off of Las Vegas Blvd in a strange strip mall; it neighbors a wig shop, a mexican bar and a Korean BBQ restaurant. All I have to say is OH MAH GOT. With all of the Michelin Rated/James Beard Award restaurants on the strip, Lotus of Siam is right there at the top. NO FUCKING LIE. When you walk in, the waiting area's walls are covered with features in top notch publications such Gourmet, Bon Appetite, Robb Report, etc etc. LOS made Robb Report's top 100 restaurants on EARFFF. This meal was probably one of the top 20 dinners I've ever had.The grilled prawn (which is actually deep fried), is straight-up one of the tastiest things I have ever had. Cooked to perfection, it's fried and seasoned with garlic, salt, pepper, and secret Thailand magical flaver. The sweetness explempliflies the freshness of the prawn. I hate prawn/shrimp skin, but yet they have made the skin taste like pure delight. OH SHIT, i'm so hunga. Lotus of Siam basically has the power to transform plastic in to fried potato-esque  goodness.",4
"The absolute worst experience I have ever had for a Las Vegas Hotel.  First we arrived early at 1230 and was told that they had no rooms available for early check-in.  That's understandable and I realized that it was a little early.  We were told that the room should be ready by 3pm.  We finally show back up at 3 and was told that they still had no rooms for us.  Instead they wanted to put us into a handicap room.  We refused and they \""found\"" us another room.  After we walked up and opened the door, lo and behold the room was still dirty and not clean.  We call the front desk and told them about the situation and were given no other choices other than to wait for the maid to clean it.  This is the most in accommodating and unprofessional hotel I have ever stayed at.  After waiting outside the room for an hour the room is finally cleaned and we get to go inside.  I will never stay here again!  Pay the extra cash and don't suffer the headache.",0
"We will NEVER return to this facility!  Our initial experience was FANTASTIC with the group that worked that day - putting in stitches - however, upon return to have 4 stitches taken out directly below my 3 year old's eye - HORRIFIC!  Zero bedside manner; no engagement with my son; expecting 3 year old to act as adult; actions portrayed that the Doctor either didn't want to do it; didn't feel he could do it; or that the entire staff was upset that they were the ones there on a Labor Day weekend.  It couldn't have been any worse except if we wouldn't have had the option to leave.  The \""mom\"" red flags went off right in the beginning but I stuck it out until it was simply ridiculous!\n\nWe ended up walking out - going to Gilbert Mercy ER - and within 20 minutes of the procedure starting we were on our way home.  The doctor and staff were excellent and knew how to treat a 3 year old - his parents - and the situation.",0
"This was my first time at this salon and it will surely be my last.  Yes, the place is very clean and has an enormous selection of polishes.  But that's where it ends.  My nail tech spoke barely one word of English.  Another tech had to speak with her in their native language to guide her.  My pedicure was very good; the chair cumfy and her massage wonderful.  But, oh, what an awful manicure!  I left there with no two nails shaped the same, and with polish coming off (even though I sat under the dryer).  My cuticles were butchered!  And when she was doing the manicure, her feet were touching mine in a way that caused the toe polish to smear off on several nails; she had to redo them.  I have never had an experience like this, nor do I want to again!",0
"I like Eat. I like the fact that it's modern, hip, urban, and located downtown. Charm, character, and frankly, they need more places like these downtown. Just across the street from Container Park and down the street from LVA (geez, where were all these places when I was a student?!). \n\nPARKING: There's metered parking galore for around $2 an hour during the daytime around here and DO NOT think you can get away without being fined. \n\nPROTIP: Get a player's card at El Cortez (free; takes two minutes) and you get to park for FREE at either of the manned parking garages (located at 7th and Ogden). Even when they charge $10 parking on Fridays/Saturday nights now, it's free if you flash your card. If you suck at parallel parking like I do even for the after-6pm free street parking, then park in the garages (you don't have to worry about walking too far to get to Container Park or the Fremont East bars). \n\nAMBIANCE: Eat. is a cute breakfast/lunch place. They're only open 8AM-3PM on weekdays and close an hour earlier on weekends. I like the decor and there's a ton of seating here for 2-4 people tables. Great use of space without feeling too cramped. There's a nice breakfast bar area near the cashier but I feel like it's a secret \""oh-god-please-don't-pick-to-sit-here-because-you'll-just-stare-at-us\""-type thing. Luckily there's another high table bar in the center that you can sit at. \n\nHip, casual atmosphere. Fun place to meet with friends or a semi-loud business lunch.\n\nFOOD: I ordered the chicken sausage, and the Chicken Pot Pie (they offer it every monday) Every other day than monday, they offer a special off-menu item so be sure to ask! \n\nI thought it was kind of funny listing \""free-range chicken\"" at every mention in the menu. I wanted to ask my server for a profile of my slaughtered hen right there. You know, just to make sure it was a happy free-range chicken when it was living. \n\nChicken pot pie ($14ish?) was good. Nicely seasoned with the right amount of mashed potatoes, gravy (dear god the gravy), carrots, slices of moist chicken, and peas inside. The pastry encasing it was fluffy, golden, and wasn't too hard biting into it. Comes with a small side salad of mixed greens and sliced carrots. Presentation was nice! Does it blow me away for what it is flavor-wise? Nope. Delicious, yes. Very well-thought out, but not wowing. Portion was decent, but not really worth the price tag. \n\nMy chicken sausage ($5ish) side dish was okay. A bit tough, but the flavor was decent. Honey-soaked flavor. Tasted fine but not really worth the price for portion honestly. \n\nService was good. Checked back on us often and our server recommended the pot pie to me. \n\nVERDICT: Overall, Eat is a few unique steps up from your average brunch place. Presentation of the food is gorgeous and the flavors are good/okay, but the price tag? Ouch. Maybe it's quality of the ingredients that justifies it. The food isn't mediocre by any means, but it's not something stunning as I'm led to believe. It's a great place to reenact scenes from Portlandia. I would definitely come back for lunch with the girlfriends. I like Eat a lot, but I'm not drinking the kool-aid just yet.",2
"I recently visited this Jersey Mike's location when I was in Charlotte on a business trip.  It is located across the parking lot from the Hyatt Place where I was staying.  This store had recently opened and was very clean and well kept. This was my first experience with a Jersey Mike's.  I was very impressed.  It reminds me a lot of Quizno's.  The staff was very helpful and friendly.  The food was prepared quickly and it tasted great.  If I ever stay in this area again, I'm sure I'll stop in for a bite.",3
"We were there for our monthly Smunch.  Only about half the folks who said they were coming showed up.  Their bad.  Somehow the restaurant had started following Smunch on Twitter so they knew we were coming.  They didn't know all the adults there were also Yelpers.  I think the front of the house was over staffed for anything less than a full house, which it never came close to.\n\nNever having been to another America's location I had nothing to compare it too.  Two of our party are regulars at the 7th St and 7th Ave locations.  All of us liked the food and the service.  Fast casual is not a place I would normally tip but the service throughout was good enough all of us tipped on the way out.  I had the taco trio and a Cochata.  Very good stuff.  If you go in and start moving tables around for a group they will actually bring out larger chip bowls and a large serving of each of the 3 dips for the table to share rather than the small serving with one salsa that normally comes with an entree.  I am pretty sure we decided in order that the guacamole, then the spicier salsa then the mild salsa.  In fact the mild hardly got touched.\n\nSo maybe it is only a 3-1/2 but it was so much better than the previous reviews had led us to believe that I rounded up instead of down this time.",3
"My first thoughts when I walked in were \""wow this a nice big attractive place\"".  The large bar is right in front and has seating and TVs all around which I like.  There are plenty of high and low tables and a nice outside patio.  With the doors rolled up you get a lot of fresh air when you're sitting inside and I love the big glass windows that look into the brewing area.\n\nI sat at the bar and didn't see a list of beers anywhere and a lot of the taps aren't marked even if you can see that far.  The waitress rattled off the beers but c'mon a real beer geek wants to see the details on the brewer, style, abv and ibu's.  It wasn't until later in the evening when they printed up a list that I could see everything they carried including a couple that the bartender didn't mention.\n\nI tried their pale ale and thought it was just Ok.  The flavors were a little muted and I'd love a little more citrus and pine flavor.  I ended up drinking an Avery Dugana and a Bell's Two-hearted which were great.\n\nFor happy hour my friend and I shared the hummus plate and a burger.  The white bean hummus was good but the flatbread was really tough to chew.  The burger was OK as was the mac and cheese side.  The mac and cheese would have been better if they added something like bread crumbs on top and then browned it to give it some crunch.\n\nI'll be interested to try some of their other beers.  Arizona Wilderness and Fate Brewing down the road are doing a great job with their own creations.  It will be interesting to see if SBC can gather a following for their beers or just be another place to grab a craft beer on a rotating handle with average food.",2
"I'm a bit turned off by Semi Chem, but I've never had a particularly bad experience in one of their stores, either.\n\nIt's a bit cheap, and a little rough around the edges - sadly, this includes the customer service experience - but it's alright.\n\nAs Gavin said, it can be your saviour if you're in desperate need of some new deodorant. I wouldn't say it was very good as a chemist, but for bargains and cheaper brands, it's ok.",2
"Had the Thanksgiving sandwich there and was pretty tasty with artisan bread.  Would like to have like a sweet soft bread to compliment all of the flavors of turkey, stuffing, cranberry sauce, and gravy.  The wait took about 10 mins and reasonable price for what you get.",2
"Ugh...I wish I could say I liked this place more since I was here to see Kaskade!! Unfortunately, this place just didn't do it for me. I appreciate their efforts of re-entry but I'm afraid to say that it makes the place WAY too crowded. A couple of other concerns tao...\n1. I didn't like the hip hop room and thought it was rather awkward \n2. Why are there tables in the hallway/walkway area? What's the point of that...you can't see anything! \n3. Every bathroom I used was gross and dirty (in my opinion) no toilet seat covers, etc. \n4. Way too many Asians \n5. Lastly, I was told by multiple employees that Kaskade would start his set at 1. That was a lie. (Boo) \n\nSorry Tao, I'd rather spend my night somewhere else",1
"This place is my favorite restaurant in Charlotte.  Relaxing, amazing food and a great atmosphere.  I always have a good time when I come and the food just get better and better every time.  The pork belly tacos are a must have. The staff is amazing.  You can't go wrong with anything you order. This place is just wonderful all around.",4
"Stayed here last week. I have very mixed emotions to share about this place. hhhmmm, where to start?\n1. stayed in a executive king suite. nice room, but was surprised at how small the tv was in this room. Family stayed across the hall in queen suite, tv just as small. \n2. they have airport check in which is a big ++++++++++++ and express check out where you can just drop a card in a box and roll out if you do not want to wait in a long line.\n3. Too big!  as big as this place was it was so crowded you could not move. seems like a party place. I recommend for twenty something year olds to get drunk, scream, act abnoxious and hook up but not for couples or if ypu are looking to relax. \n4. Too many little kids as well running all over, stepping on your toes in the elevator.\n5. very loud continous music playing everywhere, inside and outside of hotel. It was so loud, you 2would hit the button for the elevator and miss it because you could not here the bell when it arrived. This was nuts.\n6. great eats, great shopping!\n7. concierage tracy plaven and her team are top notch. Made trip enjoyable!\n8. Pool area is awesome!  very large, multiple pools. However, even though the lazy river was awesome, you  may want to grab chairs at another pool area there unless you like hundreds of little kids between the ages of 4-12 screaming and running all over. \n9. great hot tubs!\n10. over all it was nice, not great, but nice. Probably would not stay here again because the overall impfression I get was it is a meat market, very loud and the construction taking place was very annoying. We didnt even have water one morning which was quite an inconvenience and when you called the front desk about it to find oiut why, they were quite. I don't know if I would recommend this place or not, depends on your intentions when going to Vegas.",2
"The rooms were 4 star as was the service, attentive but not too intrusive.  I was troubled by the boisterous people at nearly every place I went.  One morning when I got up in the morning early for a quiet breakfast before a meeting i encountered a person being mirandized by the police in the lobby bar.  At breakfast i was the only one who had been to bed as far as i could tell. \n\n Another time a group of people doing shots of vodka in one of the main restaurants distrubing nearly everyone around them.   Maybe this is Vegas.  Also there was no place to have a quiet decent drink; the piano bar opened way too late and the smoke at one point slipped into my room (I believe people were smoking on my non-smoking floor).\n\nFinally the checkin was a mess; i don't expect to wait 45 mins in a top flight hotel to check in. The excuse I got was 'they have 2000 rooms and everyone comes at the same time'.  I said if it is that predictable then they need to redesign the whole process.",2
buffet was lousy couldn't talk to anyone who worked there nobody spoke english kids running around nobody saying anything to them there are plenty of buffets in vegas don't waist your money at texas station buffet,0
"Really enjoyed the atmosphere here. Nice and laid back! We enjoyed our food; it was very fresh.\n\nI had the soup. I was told it was a black bean chili, but it seemed to be some sort of a tortilla soup. It was very spicy! I enjoyed it for a bit, but then it ended up being a little spicy for me overall.\n\nThe country vegetable chop salad was very good. My favorite part was the breaded brussel sprouts (a nice surprise!).",3
"Note to self: chicken tacos here are horrible, terrible, deplorable, with out a welcome taste, a full on insult to my palette, flies would turn them down, marooned sailors would rather chew sand than eat these, so bad that a cat falling in the mix would be a welcome addition, so poorly seasoned and dry that I got more moisture and flavor from the cabbage. On the bright side when I throw this up in a bit my dinner from last night will make it taste better going up than it did going down! \n\nIf this place has been here for over 18 years it certainly had zero to do with chicken taco sales or the business is actually a front for a money laundering operation for the mob! The owner did look Italian..\n\nMy sister and nieces company \""niece wisely chose not to eat\"" did make it slightly bearable though..\n\nNext time I will have the fish tacos so many other people on here review well and hope for the best.\n\n I still can't get over the nasty chicken tacos, the owner needs to try his competitions tacos and refine his, if a stand in baja in the middle of no where can get it right with limited resources he should be able to get it right too.\n\nP.S. the horchada didn't suck.",0
"I have been to several events and fundraisers where Arizona Nights was DJ, bartender and hosting casino games.  \n\nThey are AWESOME.  I love working with Diane and Greg.\n\nGreat music, fun and engaging.  Believe me you will have a great time.\n\nAnd don't forget the Casino games.  Sooooo much fun.  Anytime I hear they are going to be doing a fundraiser I am right on it and so are my friends.\n\nWhat more could you want?  Raise money for a worthy cause and have a blast doing it.\n\nWin win if you ask me.",4
"Yummy!\n\nInside the fun New York New York casino, Chin Chin is the same restaurant which I dined at in Los Angeles on Sunset Boulevard a few months ago. \n\nSophie, our server, was amazing, which made the meal even better. Arrived before seeing Zumanity, and tried their dim sum, chicken in lettuce cups and a bowl of the hot and sour soup. Fresh and filling, and not too pricey. \n\nWasn't too crowded either, as it was around 5:30 when I arrived, but got more and more crowded during the meal. Not gourmet Chinese food, but not bad either.",3
"Justin was awesome. He arrived early to my appointment, was incredibly friendly and cool, and got the job done amazingly. My never-been-cleaned carpet looks FANTASTIC now! I definitely recommend Elite's services and will use him again when the time comes. Thanks again, Justin!",4
I'm going to make this short and sweet. \n\nNot impressed.,1
"All I can say is that The Greene House served it's purpose, but it's nothing to write home about.  \nIt's not very distinguishable from Zinc Bistro since its in the same area.  \n\nWe started off the meal with their soggy fried calamari and artisan cheeses that were just average.  My boyfriend enjoyed his trout and I liked my pork tenderloin and sauces, but the creamy cornbread (polenta) that accompanied the entree had a weird texture.  \nGood thing we ordered fingerlings!\nMy friends had the Mahi tacos, but the limes were dry and another had the\nKobe burgers with Mac and Cheese.  \n\nThe service was good, always refilling the drinks and available.  \nAs a whole the food and restaurant were not memorable and I probably would not ever go there again.",1
"We had planned on eating a late breakfast at the Original Breakfast House just down 32nd Street, but did not realize that they would be closed for Labor Day. We headed north toward the Harkins North 16 Cinema and stumbled upon Denny's.  We still had plenty of time before our movie, or so we thought.\n\nThe entryway was warm and crowded with people waiting.  Only a ten minute wait was indicated, so we decided to stay.  When we were seated, we noticed the restaurant itself seemed a bit warm as well.  We waited a very long time just to have our presence recognized by a server.  Eventually, beverage orders were taken.  Coffee was delivered without an offer of creamer and we labored another five minutes just to make eye contact with anyone who could bring us some.  Food orders were finally taken and were served in a reasonable amount of time, although there was a significant amount of time between when the first person in our party and the last was served.  Not a big deal, but it's awkward to postpone eating until everyone is served and awkward when they insist that you go ahead and eat.\n\nWell, it's Denny's.  The food was fine.  Uninspired.  Just what you'd expect.  Given that you can eat at a really good breakfast joint just a few blocks away, however, I'm just not sure why you'd want to settle for this.  I'm pleased that the Original Breakfast House treats their employees well with the day off, but I doubt that I would ever head back to Denny's anytime OBH was open.\n\nBy the time we were finishing, we had used all of our available time and felt as though we'd been eating in a sauna.  The restaurant never cooled down.  Not revealed to us when we checked in was the not insignificant fact that their air conditioning was broken.  Not all of their air conditioning.  Only the part where their patrons were seated.  Revealing this tidbit of information to customers when they came in the door would have been the honorable thing to do.  Yes, we probably would have elected to go elsewhere, but it's what any good restaurant would do for their customers.  But not Denny's.      \n\nThis Denny's is nice in appearance and some employees seem well intentioned.  When you are serving \""average\"" food, however, it's critical that employees and managers go above and beyond to compensate. That did not happen on this day.  Not even close.",0
"Good for drinks but not much else... Margaritas \""blended\"" were an icy/watery mess and the table side made guacamole featured full leaves of cilantro and chunks of jalape\u00f1o - could use a smaller chop there. Just grab drinks at the bar and you'll be fine.",1
"Service was excellent; ordered chicken with basil and chilis; green papaya salad and seafood spagetti.  Stir fried chicken with basil was really excellent.  The papaya salad was incredibly small for the $9 price.  Really, the restaurant can do better.  Spagetti was so-so.  But, I can see why the restaurant has a lot of fans.  We arrived before Monday night opening, and there was already a line.  Wasn't my cup of tea.",2
HNS Garage Doors came out to my residence to fix a broken spring on my garage door after it snapped early this morning. This company came in a timely manner and was very fast and efficient at repairing the damage. I called other companies before and HNS was the only company the answered the phone and was able to accommodate my schedule. I want to thank HNS & Travis for the excellent customer service and work performed . I wouldn't recommend any other garage door repair company. Thank you very much for the help.,4
"We came during Happy Hour, and it was the cheapest meal we had in Vegas. I had the Viva Las Vegas Roll, and was stuffed. That thing is heavy duty.\n\nBoyfriend had the crispy tuna roll and the spicy yellowtail roll. That crispy tuna roll is amazing. It was my favorite. The spicy yellowtail...good, but not spicy at all. \n\nWe also had the pineapple cream cheese wontons, and they were gross. But our waitress took them off the bill immediately when we handed back the plate with all but one wonton. \n\nOf course this place isn't traditional, just take a look at it! But it was fun, cheap, yummy and made for great people watching.",3
"Ugh....when you have thoughts that you are going to a dive bar, and you get this?  Not a pleasant thought.\n\nWent there with a friend on Saturday night (can you all guess who that was??? LOL)  and the first thing I kept on thinking was...\""Wow this place is bright.\""  Very sports bar atmosphere with horrible Karaoke and weird people.  \n\nYes, there were a lot of ladies there....so the pickings for men were slim.  I had a couple of drinks and all I wanted was to find a decent guy to stick my tongue down his throat!  (Kidding, y'all)  All I got was some pretty boy who thought we were talking about curling and some weird dude next to us who sings a bad ass Barry Manilow. \n\nOh!  And when we were waiting for our ride (plus on the car service availability) some weird freak of nature walked up to us outside.  He was talking to me in some weird radio announcer voice in my ear.  All I wanted to do was run hom and shower and sanitize my hair and ear.  \n\n2 stars for the chicken fingers (yummy) and car service.  \n\nSo not a dive bar.",1
"Ehhh was just okay. \n\nI went here because I was in Vegas for work and needed a mani/pedi before a wedding the coming weekend. Read good things so I thought why not, right!??\n\nHad a deluxe pedi and shellac mani. The scrub and massage with the pedi was great. Good selection of colors, especially the gel options. My paint just didn't last on either. My toes were chipped by Friday (and I did this on a Thursday night) and my shellac manicure was cracked and peeling by Saturday. I was not wearing crazy shoes where my toes were getting stubbed or my nails were hitting things, and I hadn't been swimming or soaked my hands in water. I usually get 2 weeks out of a gel manicure easily and 2-3 (atleast!) out of a pedi. \n\nJust disappointed!",2
"The club itself is beautiful. Different rooms and bar areas to lounge in. Thank god for a hip hop room... I don't know why it's so hard to find hip hop in vegas. Even with Marcus Schulz spinning in the main room, as reputable as he is, I just can't get my party on to trance. wompwompwomp unce unce unce... NOOOO! I want to groove and grind, not jump!  Anyway, beautiful atmosphere and view on top of the cosmo. \n\nThe BAD- SERIOUSLY?! ALL THOSE STAIRS!!?!?!?!?! How can you expect me to get all dolled up and climb up all those stairs AND when I drink how am I supposed to make my way back down??! I don't understand!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Do people get carried out of this place or what? \n\nI really would love to party here more whenever I'm in town but it's just not practical for me. The event hosts/promoters/bouncers are really sweet and helpful, not douchey like other places so I really wanted to make this a regular spot. I just don't want to worry about how I'm going to get out of there or how much my feet are hurting before I even start getting my party on.",2
"Good food, reasonable prices. I've been to the location on Univ avenue and it's pretty good.",2
"Best sushi ever, can't wait to try it once again. Deserves every penny, in the end you get what you pay for. If you're sushi fan, then you must try this place. By far the best ever sushi in Pittsburgh . The waitresses are so friendly . The environment so elegant, lavish, and classy . I highly recommend this restaurant .",4
"I came through this dive while pub-crawling amongst friends. As we lined up at the bar to order beers and grub -- the bartender's muttering under her breath \""oh shit.\"" should have tipped us off to the piss poor service that awaited us. Apparently they're not accustomed to seeing a group of ~12 people waltz in this dump. Go fig'. Mind you, we were very accommodating, and considerate of the surprise rush we created. However, when they served our table separately and completely forgot my food, I was forced to demand a refund. They're lucky I wasn't a complete a**hole and demanded the portion of the tip that I already paid toward my food order.\n\nSure, if you're looking for a very lonely dive all to yourself and a /few/ friends, this might be your place. But for us, it was a complete and utter disaster.\n\nOh, did I mention the incessant flies throughout the establishment? Yeah, not cool.",0
"The wife and I have gone here several times in the evening when we want a simple, casual and easy meal and we don't have the time to cook or feel like it. \n\nGetting coupons in the mail or through the Sweet Tomatoes club definitely makes coming here more attractive-buy 1 meal, get 1 free . Hard to beat a meal for two for around $10. \n\nThe food has always been fresh with a wide variety of options to place on your lettuce. There are usually about 5 choices of soup/chili.  The Chinese Chicken salad is always a good option.  I enjoy the blueberry muffins.\n\nWe went here the other night and were treated to a pretty good strawberry and apple cobbler. In the past, we went when the dessert was carrott cake and that was very good.\n\nThe self serve ice cream is always a nice touch or to use and make a root beer float.\n\nThis location is usually busy, the couple of times we've gone  but not too loud.  We've only gone on Sunday evening and mid week though.",3
Oh My! FUN! The bartender told us about awesome crab cakes and they were delicious! Free happy hour is just as awesome for us ladies! Not so much eye candy but its all good !,4
"Hip place for a younger, scantily clad group to hang in the sun. Totally a place to be seen.  Good but expensive service. Cabanas generally run $500+ or you can rent a lounger. Funny to see 5 to 6 people sharing one lounger. Economies of scale I guess. High-traffic weekends bump the cost of a cabana to nearly 3 times as much. Swell cabanas though. Air-conditioned and nice accommodations. Typical club beach fab music that will leave you deaf and hoarse from screaming to converse with your fellow sun seekers.",1
"I'm finding myself eating wings a lot more since I came down south, and I can say that Flip'n Chicken does it well! Forget Bojangles when it comes to wings. \n\nFirst off, the people who work there are very welcoming. Call me corny, but I like it when someone asks, \""Have you eaten here before?\""\n\nNow onto the wings...there's plenty of flavors and the chicken is cooked just right. With your wings you'll get plenty of breadsticks...and I mean plenty. Personally I found that part to be a bit much. If you're going to eat here, you'll enjoy the food. Just make sure to leave your diet at the door.",3
"This was my 3rd time here. Another food trip inspired by a restaurant.com $25 gift certificate.\n\nWe arrived at 7pm Friday night and the parking lot was fairly full but once we entered the dining room was empty-everyone was in the bar.\n\nWe asked to sit upstairs in the game room and it was empty to. We had it all to ourselves....or so we thought.\n\nThey have 2 pool tables,fooseball,pinball, racing,hunting and a jukebox plus a big screen with 3 couches to lounge and a 100\""+ projection screen for events,etc.\n\nThere's also a small bar upstairs but the waitresses do have to run up & down the stairs for soft drinks & food.\n\nWe ordered drinks & some cheeseburger sliders for an appetizer. Then we all ordered sandwiches and a steak.\n\nMy son got the Teriyaki Swiss burger with fries, my wife got the Turkey Bacon Club and I got the  Mustang Melt-an 8oz New York with bleu cheese and bacon bits.\n\nBefore the food arrived a group of 10-12 kids and their parents arrived to add some life to the place. The kids were all well-behaved and excitedly enjoying all the games.\n\nThe service was great, the food however was just ok. The hamburger taste like frozen patties flavorless & dry -not at all good. The turkey club was great and the steak was enjoyable but the bleu cheese & bacon wasn't necessary the steak would have been better without it.\n\nI was a little disappointed they didn't have the california-style  tuna melt that used to be on the menu (http://www.menusearch.net/lasvegas/restaurant.php?name=570)\n\nI will buy another GC @ restaurant.com but I will stay away from the burgers and stick to the pork tenderloin.",2
"Nice big, clean, store of moderate upscale feel with wide, uncramped aisles.  Quiet and pleasant on all occasions I've been there, though at somewhat \""off\"" hours.   Deli counter, in-house bakery, pharmacy, US Bank, and Starbucks.  Personable early morning Starbucks gal much appreciated! Store staff always helpful when asked. Some friendly, some perfunctory, but never rude.  Good produce.",3
"Highend not likley great decor. Service no bueno sorry guys. Hostess super cool. Our first waiter said he would take our order only if we placed it Quickly. WTH RIGHT. My bf and roomie ordered steak and mashed potatoes. Friend also ordered Caesar salad. Me asparagus and losbster soup (very fishy and bland) it took almost 1hour to receive our dinner yes well done steak request take longer but an hour and not one person came to let us know status. Sad. I never expected this awful service. I have dined at, mastros by my home in LA and would NEVER get this bad service.  Hour later dinner arrives oh and guess who makes a guest appearance our new waiter.  Food is ok and we did not see waiter until we asked for check. Btw we missed our show . Next morning I reported it to front desk and said a food and beverage manager would contact us.  I am home a week later and still nada. Sorry guys. I was do disapointed.",1
"The Heinz  museum was a very interesting and fun place to visit. I really enjoyed the exhibition on Ariabia, which is a cargo ship that sunk in the 1800's and was found  in 1987. They also had a Heinz exhibit which was really cool all the different products he made starting in 1870 then they had a glass exhibit which I found to be very interesting it takes several hours to walk around the whole museum and there are a lot of really cool things to see they have a sports area that is really cool for all you sports fans.. The museum is geared for children as well as adults there is even a smoothie shop downstairs for afterwards and a little play area",4
"Every time I come down to this theater I am sort of reminded of Toonstown in Disneyland. As an AMC theater, the picture and sound qualities of each of the theaters are pretty decent. There is an upstairs restaurant and downstairs barista and concession stands. I have met quiet a few rude people that work here and I do not like the whole VIP seating option because if the theater is always crowded in the lower regions. All that is left are crappy seats down below and the attendants in the VIP area are usually really rude. \n\nCompared to the theater at Southside Works, AMC Loews is really overpriced and crowded.",2
"I came here for happy hour and I was not too happy when I left.  I had  a Pyramid Weiss Cream and a Watermelon Cream drink they had.\n\nSpicy BBQ Pork Belly:\nCubes of pork belly. Comes with fennel, carrots and cheddar ale sauce. The cheddar ale sauce reminds me of the taste in my mouth after I've had way too much to drink. 3/5\n\nShort Rib Patty Melt:\nProvolone, gruyere, onions and \""fancy sauce\"". It's an ordinary patty melt. 3/5\n\nHand-Cut Fries:\nReal potatoes. Nothing special. 3/5\n\nBradley's Butterscotch Pudding:\nButterscotch pudding with snicker doodle cookies.  A bit too sweet. I'm not a fan. 2/5\n\nI was not impressed.",2
"3 words.... TO DIE FOR! What an amazing restaurant. The ambiance is classy, the staff was friendly and knowledgeable and the food was unbelievable. Coming from Los Angeles, our standards for steakhouses are very high and they met the challenge without a sweat. It was hard to decide what to eat because the entire menu was unique and interesting. For starters my husband had the Butter Lettuce salad with the most amazing champagne-herb vinaigrette we have ever had. I had a unique Beet salad with Humboldt fog goat cheese and the flavors blended perfectly. For our steaks it was hard to pick just one (which by the way, they do a tasting of 3 as well...which would be smart if you have never had wagyu before, totally worth it). He had the filet and I had the new york sirloin of their American Wagyu Beef from Snake River Farms Idaho. AMAZING!!! If you are a mushroom person, I would recommend adding this on your steak, the flavors were perfect. For dessert, he had the chocolate souffle and I had the cheese plate, both of which were a perfect ending to a perfect evening. \nThank you to the executive chef and the staff for a memorable last night in Vegas for us!",4
"yea i know mimi's is a chain, so don't give me shit about it. i don't really care.\n\nthe grilled cheese sandwich here is straight bombin like iraq in 2002\n\nother favs are the turkey dinner, because why do people have to wait till November to have a good turkey dinner? you shouldn't so check it out. also on the list of things to try before you die...the pain purdue. its sick. sick sick. or at least thats how you will feel after you finish it. it's soooo sweet your teeth will beg you to see a dentist, stat. it's basicly french toast stuffed with sweetness. its badass.\n\nthe atmoshere at mimi's is totally chain, i've been to a few different locations and each one is exactly the same as the others. same wall decorations, which is like french quarter jazzy junk. \n\noh yea..they have mimosa's...yea i like mimosas in the morning..i admit it. how can you not like champaign in the morning? who doesnt like to get drunk in the morning????",2
"SOUP. FALAFEL. DRINK. $2 (+tax).\n\nIt's not a big falafel, and the quality is no Boustan, but it's still two dollars for a full meal. Not to be messed with.",3
"Where do I start?  \n\nIf there's any review you ACTUALLY read, let it be this one! \n\nONLY reason I came here the few times I did was because it is on my way home!  This place is HORRIBLE! Never again. The PEOPLE. The food, inside the building looks dirty!  They talk to each other more than anything, do not even bother to say hello to anyone coming in, the person at drive thru talks like it is our fault they works at Popeyes, always sound so irritated. \n\nThe food here, is always cold, old and obviously sits there for a while. They have conversations in front of customers that should not be happening at the moment. My boyfriend came in here one time and actually argued with the cashier about his food being cold and she argued back like no it wasn't. She ended up saying the cops will be called, so guess what?  My boyfriend called the cops himself and they told him they do not respond to restaurant complaints, OBVIOUSLY. \n\nSo the manager came out and asked What's wrong, my boyfriend explained. He looked at the cashier & asked her why didn't she just give him some new fresh food? Same thing he was wondering. \n\nIt's HORRIBLE SERVICE, FOOD & A business horribly ran. It's worth it to drive to the next nearest one because this one is not worth a cent!",0
"Chicken and waffles.  Wonder.  Malted waffle batter added surprising flavor to thin white meat juicy fried chicken on thick waffles.  Four pieces of chicken covering each of the quarters of waffles.  Strawberry compote (from crepes) went fabulously well with this ridiculous combination. I kept thinking these disparate mealtime pieces had no business being together.   I was so wrong.\n\nThe four cheese (cottage, cream, sour&?) crepes (two) filled the plate. Just the right amount of sweet to savory balance.  It came with choice of fruit compote. I chose strawberry on the side.  I like to taste the main part before dousing it with something all to sweet.  Good thing.  'Cause my Partner-in-Dine used it on her chicken and waffles.\n\nShe also ordered cheese fries (not on menu and not a problem).  We expected cheddar cheese but got American which, was just as good.\n\nMy crepes came with three eggs and my choice of crispy bacon.  Done right.  Everything from greeting upon entry to accommodating both of our particular preferences with a smile and speed.  No sense our server was hiding an eye roll.  She made us happy and made us believe she was happy to serve us.\n\nWe will be back.\n\nAnd the next day we were.  To a different location this time.  My First PID had the Veal Parmigiana.  The veal was nearly 3/4 inch thick and the batter was thin and crispy.  Too often it is the reverse.  PID2 had to try the Chicken and Waffles.  He is picky about this kind of thing, too.  He finished them off.  I had eggs & bacon cooked exactly as I ordered (I am finicky about this, as many other things) and pancakes so light, fluffy, sweet, and HUGE.  I couldn't finish it all.  Unusual for me not to leave a clean plate.  But, I was so full there was just no way.\n\nService here was equally as good as at the other location.\n\nHighly recommend.",4
"Overall, I liked the food and my Mexican craving was satisfied. The fresh peach margarita was really yummy and I appreciated the free chips and salsa. Our server was really friendly and kept the drinks coming. I was okay with the music, but it was really loud. It was loud enough that I could barely hear my sister across the table. They had a DJ and an MC that gave out free shots of tequila to people who were celebrating things. It wasn't cheap for sure, but I thought the prices were reasonable for Las Vegas (more expensive than your hometown, but not ridiculous). I would come back.",3
"Friendly service, good tasting food. Lots of TVs and good happy hour drink prices.",3
"Visited Public House again, but this time we hung out in the lovely lounge, enjoying the sights and suds.\n\nIt's too hard to choose a beer! There's so many. But, honestly, a good problem to have =)  Enjoyed the Pork Rinds again, they are too good, and sampled the Poutine too. If only I could have eaten the fries to complement the yummy curds and gravy! Nice flavors and textures coming together.\n\nPlace is still cool, service is still good, bathroom still needs toilet seat covers & paper towel holders ;)  And, I'll still be back next time I'm in Vegas!",3
The food is not good\nWeekends are very crowded\nSo mediocre.\n\n(b),1
"It was some form of ladies night and my friend and I were able to get in with a $10 cover after midnight.\n\nNow, upon entering, you will realize it's a cute modestly sized lounge with people dancing where space allowed. I know it's Vegas but it's not a club- so what gives with the cover charge?\n\nDJ played the top 100 hits. Zzz.\nSaw people at the bar who were old enough to be my parents- my parents dressed to lounge around in the house.\nI guess despite the cover and 3 bouncers, they're really lax on who they let in.\n\nThe crowd may have sucked but the employees were accomodating. Bartenders were really nice. The bathroom attendant even cleaned one of the bathrooms for me before entering.\nI saw the dancers on stage be approached by several people for pictures and they happily obliged.\n\nGood: nice atmosphere to just sit and have a few drinks although music's a bit loud.\nBad: you wanna chill with a crowd that runs up to 60+ year olds with drunks grinding where there isn't furniture.",2
"not a huge cupcake connoisseur, but had a craving all of sudden, checked out yelp and found the cupcakery, I ordered the \""Southern Belle (red velvet with cream cheese frosting), \""Boston Dream\"", and \""Almond Joy\"" (white cake with chocolate frosting topped with shredded coconut and sliced almonds), I agree with everyone else, looks much better than it tastes, but still not bad, not overly sweet, a little on the dry side, and little pricey, but I did enjoy it, great location near restaurants/ strip mall, and nice little shop. **overall: would still go out of my way to come back, due to the convenience  of the location and just the feeling you get when you walk into a small cupcake shop.....makes me happy ...like going to Disneyland!\n**update: waited to eat the last cupcake,  Almond Joy, this was kept in the refrigerator and a day old but it was still REALLY good, the chocolate frosting was yummy but they do put a LOT of it on the cupcakes, which I don't really mind, good combo and probably better refrigerated so the frosting is a little firmer and easier to eat/ portion.",2
"Nice open space.  Waitress needs to wear shoes not flip flops.  Ordered onion rings, but forgot to bring them to us.  We had a coupon for $7.99 fish fry, small three pieces.  The cole slaw was soggy, surprisingly the french fries were good.  Michael and I ordered gin & tonics, well drinks were $3.00 during happy hour.  You get what you pay for...they dont use the good gin.  We will not go back for the cocktails.",0
"Great wings.  We stopped after a Long day at Carowinds.  Thanks Yelp for helping us find someplace close to the park. The wings were excellent.  We had hot garlic(they use minced garlic!), lemon pepper, teriyaki, Maui wowie, and salt & vinegar. All were very good.  Ranch and. Blue cheese were tasty. My wife had a fish sandwich which she said was very good. She was a little nervous about it being a fish sandwich from a wing place. Good stop on the way home.",3
"I'll have to eat here again, I wasn't really impressed but I didn't get my usual \""Taco Shop\"" fare. The restaurant was really clean and the staff was very polite. The prices were pretty reasonable in comparison to Roberto's. I personally like Roberto's better but I'll try Pepe's again before I make a for sure judgement.",2
We stopped by Morning Glory cafe after a hike up south mountain.  I love going to the farm and the morning glory cafe is always enjoyed by our guests when visiting.  The cafe was packed and the service was a bit slow.  Please don't forget though the kitchen is quite small. I tried the chorizo omelet and it was lovely. The potatoes are always perfectly cooked and the biscuit is a nice complement to the meal.  Many healthy options to choose from and all fresh ingredients used!  Enjoy.,3
"I was super excited to find out that Serendipity opened up a location in Las Vegas! Of course for a getaway weekend we'd spend one of our meals there.\n\nWe get there and there is a 30 min wait, but we're down for it as there is a quick stop bar where the ladies partook in a frozen hot chocolate to wait out the line. Out front there are also shaded tables to wait by.\n\nWhen we finally got in we were seated on their outside deck, close to one of the mist fans that was partially broken. It kept dripping water on one of my friends. \n\nWe quickly decided and tried to flag down our waitress.  It was incredibly hot outside and we wanted something to drink. Water took a while to come out and when we were ready to order our waitress took her time getting to us, giving us the index finger \""one minute\"" signal while she continued to gab away with a coworker. \n\nEventually we got our orders in, and I ordered the french toast log. I think it took close to 40 mins for our food to arrive. By that time we were seriously pondering leaving and just paying for the drinks. But when we got our food it was all tasty, every plate was gi-huge-o. My log of french toast was ridiculous. \n\nTrying to get our waitress to come bring us the check was another ordeal. Good food, but ultimately disappointing service, combined with a dripping fan and sitting on the hot patio. I think I'll just stick to going to Serendipity when I'm in NYC again, at least that time proved worthy of the wait.",1
"After waiting in the drive thru for about a half an hour with only three cars ahead of us, came home to open the bag with someone else's order... Fail!",0
"Now this is what I call a first class joint.\n\nFulfills your quick BBQ fix. Choose what type of sandwich you want, which type of sauce and I promise, PROMISE that your dreams will come true.\n\nI expect to go to this place about 2-3 a week. Yeah, it's that LBD.\n\nLBD scale- 9.5. That's pretty damn legitimate big dog.",4
Brand X is the best option for anyone looking to get custom apparel made. Phil helped me make a large t-shirt order extremely easy and stress free. He was very helpful and responded to all emails in no time. \n\nThe staff will work with you to customize your design exactly to your liking. They offer a variety of different quality t-shirts at a decent price. Skip the generic internet t-shirt printing and go to Brand X.,4
This place came highly recommended. We grabbed lunch here and boy were we in for a shock when the bill came. Our server was really attentive and so graciously charged us for extra funny-tasting salsa and salad dressing. I didn't feel like the food and beverages were worth the money that we paid. I have had better chain Mexican food but cool for drinks and apps.... I guess.,2
"They have good baked baguettes and the price was $1.50 last month, however raising the price to $2 per roll during the holiday's is ridiculous.  The female cashier was short and unprofessional.  While i was waiting for the rolls, she was rude to the next three customers spending money.  They need to work on their customer service and I vowed never to go back.",1
"This has to be one of the worst airports ever!  If you get dropped off (or picked up), you get yelled at for taking too long. Then they have double \""parking\"" on drop off so you get yelled out for not being able to move. Huh?  Once inside you're kind of on your own...not a lot of signs to direct you to the right place. If you ask for help, you will more than likely be \""greeted\"" with an unfriendly \""yeah\"".  The only reason I gave it 2 stars instead of 1 is because they do have free wifi.",1
"Great place to visit, free admission, epic cars. Love the cafe on the second floor, check out beautiful views with good food!",4
So let's start with 5 stars....well they lose a star just on service.   When I was there this afternoon there was only one other customer.   From the time I ordered to the time I received my food. ..15 minutes...a car pulled up behind me and eventually pulled over and the couple walked inside.  Another star lost due the food  being very heavy on the salt.   However on the plus side the man who took my order was very polite and made sure my order was correct and that I had all my extras condiments.   This place was first known via Food Network's Diners DriveIns and Dives....well this location is a dive. So that is factored in as well. Evidently they filmed at the Decatur St location.   My Pastrami Burger was as delicious as advertised.   The highlight however were the garlic fries.  Absolutely awesome!!  They are thin but moist and flavorful. .....Overall I will go back to try again but maybe try the other location.   It is also rather expensive but you do get a lot of food. ......,2
This place was ok. Parking does suck. I don't understand why they have valet but it was cheap so we used it. \n\nA major plus here is their patio. It appears to be bigger than the restaurant and you can play boci ball! It was over a hundred degrees when I was here celebrating a friend's engagement and they turned off the misters. WHY??? The fans were still going but they didn't help much. I tried some appetizers. The artichoke dip tasted like cream cheese. I though the guac and salsa were better. And the service was so slow. We were here for 2 hours and only had 2 drinks and not by choice. \n\nI actually came here during Yelp Eats week and was never informed that they were participating. We were only given regular menus. After I found out that they were a participating restaurant a couple of days after our visit I asked some of the other people who had been there if they were ever offered the alternative menu and not one person said they had. \n\nLame.,1
Nice clean place;  can get busy at lunch; today I noticed some serious attitudes amounst the crew here.  They seem very apathetic;  this may point to a management issue with this location.,2
"Funny story. \n\nOne hot summer day less than a year ago my dad and I were out in search of a late lunch/ early dinner. A burger sounded fine and we had driven past this place a few times so we thought we'd drop in. \n\nWe knew that quite a few places on this stretch were of the gay persuasion, but it didn't occur to us that Burger Betty's would be one. \n\nWalk inside and you'll quickly realize that this is not intended for a father-son lunch spot. We backpedaled. We asked a couple of questions. We left. \n\nTruth be told, my dad and I are both liberal guys and would have stuck around if the burgers weren't so expensive. From the looks of the other reviews we made the right call.",1
"Love pie rush free slice of pie. I always end up coming back for a whole pie after trying a new one. The blackberry bavarian was only here for January and I wish they would make it an everyday pie. The prices are good and the breakfast is the best. I love the VIB. What stops me from giving 4 stars is the fact that some lunch and dinner items taste like they came from a can. For instance, beef soup, turkey, and cranberry sauce are not that great. Also, the server named Cindy really needs to improve. I don't want her to be fired but I have had her several times and she is forgetful, slow, and inattentive. If I order anything special or extra, she gets it wrong. And heaven forbid you ask for a box to go, she will forget. She never even offers a free slice of pie on pie rush days, she just leaves the check on your table. She doesn't ask if you need anything. She just drops the food off then drops off the check. And it takes her FOREVER to do anything. The first time we had her we tipped our typical 25% thinking she was having a bad day. The second time we had her we sat down and there was a $1 tip left on the table. We thought either someone was cheap or maybe they had Cindy. Sure enough it was Cindy and sure enough she gave the same bad service. We did not over-tip as we usually do, but she still got a 15% tip from us because we know servers depend on that for bills at home, but from now on we will request another waitress so we can tip someone well who actually deserves it. I hope she gets the chance to improve, but service can make a huge difference in the way we rate an eatery.",2
"Haus Murphy is the only authentic German bar/restaurant in the west valley.  They have 10 taps (Weihenstephaner Hefe-Weissbier, Franziskaner Weissbier, Spaten Optimator, Spaten Marzen, Warsteiner, and a couple more...).\n\nService is usually good and it has a very charming, relaxed atmosphere with German decor.\n\nMature customer base also... which is to my liking.",3
"Ok ok, this place is fine.  But it's so LOUD.  Don't expect to have an actual conversation with whoever you are dining with.  And it's a little hard to find something on the menu that doesn't have bacon.  If you're a veggie there is one option you can, but the veggie option (like for an omelet) are scarce.  However, what I did order tasted good, it's just not something I wanted to eat really, it was kinda my only option.  When I go out for breakfast I want an amazing breakfast burrito with a side of fruit, not some eggs I could have made at home.",2
"I don't really have high expectations for Wal-mart, so here goes. We did our grocery shopping and various other shopping trips here for about a year and a half. We recently switched to eating all fresh food, and we go to Food Lion for that now. The only good thing I can really say about this Walmart is the prices are low, there are wide sections and varieties of what you're looking for and what to look at, and much more. The customer service however, is bad. I remember almost bumping into one of the Walmart employees and instead of saying excuse me, she laughed and kept on her business. The cashiers aren't all that great either. I highly recommend you go somewhere else if you can.",1
"My daughter and I stopped in to Aside of Heart today for lunch and thought the food was fantastic.  She had the tofu block and I had the tacos. Both were delicious.  The prices were very reasonable as well.  Next time we go back, we're going to have to try more of the vegan desserts.  They also had a great selection of smoothies.",4
"My boyfriend and I got an amazing deal on Orbitz for $50.00 per night at this hotel.  When we got there, however, we realized we wouldn't have payed a penny more for it, for it was one of those rooms that just made you feel dirty.  There were oh-so-classy mirrors on the ceiling and I think there were blood stains on the tikki couch.\n\nNot only that, the POOL was CLOSED.  I would think that would be the main draw for this shack, and there were people swimming in the INDOOR part while the rest of us layed around on the lawn chairs like beached whales, stairing at the germ-encrusted waters that had not yet been prepped for the season.  About an hour in to our sunbathing, a boy with a tropicana shirt came over peddling his towels on us, which incidentally, looked like the dish towels that they used in the kitchen last night, and were not much bigger, i'd wager.  It took about four of them to cover the chair under me, and I had to be careful to avoid the brown stains.",0
"I've been here when it was just a quarter of the size it is now. Russell was always so great with his customers! They even incorporated a Chinese addition to their menu. The menu is Korean Hawaiian fusion.The restaurant is much larger now but the food seems the same which is the most important. I love their meat jun, it's a meat cake fried in egg batter and it's paired with macaroni salad, rice, and of course your traditional korean appetizers. It's a joint perfect for asian cravings.",4
"After eagerly awaiting the opening of Noodles & Co I was very excited to try it. A friend and I arrived just after 12:30 and the line was nearly out the door. This wasn't surprising seeing it was a new restaurant, however, after finishing my meal and over hearing the comments of the diners around me, I can see this place having a steady 20 person line from 11:30 - 1:30. The interior is smartly designed, open, and bright. I also couldn't get over how great the staff was, everyone was very friendly and seemed like they legitimately were in a good mood and wanted to share that with you. \n\nI did the \""Pick 3\"" deal where you get a small noodle bowl, a choice of protein, and soup or salad for $7.99. I ordered the Indonesian Noodle dish with spicy peanut sauce (really awesome, perfectly \""make your nose run\"" spicy, and packed with fresh vegetables), I added beef, and the Tomato Basil soup (my favorite part of the meal). By the time I added a drink my bill came to just under $10. I can't wait to come back and try some of their other options, I saw a meatball sub that looked pretty excellent.",3
"I'd give it a 3.5 stars if i could.\nIt's a good buffet, but i don't really feel like i have to go back.",2
"After moving to the area in June, I had yet to find a new hairstylist. Based on the reviews for this place I thought I would give it a try. \n\nI was greeted warmly by the two ladies at the front desk as well as their yellow lab. \n\nAlex washed, cut and blow dried my hair, and did an excellent job. I would recommend her to anyone.\n\nIt was especially nice that the shop manager kept referring to me by my name. It made me feel very much at home and like I had been going there for a long time. \n\nMy total was only $25 for everything she did. Needless to say i have found my salon and will be going here from now on. \n\nThe staff is very friendly, the atmosphere cool, and relaxing, and I have a great cut.",4
"It's hard to sum up my feelings about this place. \""Meh\"" seems to be the closest description. In fact, that was the exact response when I asked my boyfriend how his french onion soup was. \n\nLet's start at the beginning. The Mill opened a few months ago in that big brick building where the old Fishbone Grill used to be. When you walk in you can see that they didn't do much remodeling, but they didn't need to. The exposed wood rafters, stained concrete floor, and low brick dividing walls leftover from Fishbone fit perfectly into the mill house/country vintage chic vibe they were going for. The atmosphere was nice, subtle, and infused with some softer classic rock. The atmosphere isn't as important as the food, and unfortunately in this case the food did not quite compare.\n\nWe had crab dip, french onion soup, and fettuccine alfredo, which we got in that order and in a timely fashion. The crab dip was good, with a nice layer of melty pepper jack cheese that lent just the right amount of spice to an otherwise average dip. The aforementioned \""meh\"" french onion soup came alongside my salad, a mixture of greens (no brown iceburg here) with a disappointing honey mustard dressing. The soup itself was \""fine, but like they pulled it off before it was done cooking\"", lacking the deep, stewed-for-days flavor that makes a fantastic french onion soup. The alfredo was fine. Thick, creamy, a little too much pepper an not enough garlic, but a generous portion for nine dollars. We split it and still ended up taking half home.\n\nWould I recommend The Mill? Sure. There's something for everyone, and the service, atmosphere, and beer, can probably make up for the mediocre food.",2
"We meant to order the poutine, but had burgers and fries instead.  Excellent.  The crowd is mostly 20 somethings, but the staff is friendly and all are welcome.  Bustling and efficient service.  Fun, inexpensive dining out.",3
"I must have looked like a deer in the headlights when I entered Meatballz because they asked if it was my first time in as they gave me a menu. It was my first time at this location. I decided to make a road trip from my office and go over to Desert Ridge to take in the views and the great weather we are having today.\n\nI ordered my usual sausage roll which was delicious. Great customer service as well as they brought out silverware and napkins to me out on the patio. However, I thought $9.84 for a Sausage Roll and a drink for lunch was a little too steep so I knocked off a star. But the patio was perfect and definitely geared for people watching.",2
"The Carnival World Buffet USED to be my all-time favorite Vegas buffet.  Over the last 8 years of frequenting this buffet, the price has gone up, and the quality of the food has gone down.  \n\nDon't get me wrong, it's not horrible... it's just not what it used to be.  For the price (about $50 for my wife and I @ the Sunday brunch), I expected a lot better food and service.  Seems like they're hiring a bunch of tards to work here, cuz the level of service has vastly declined.  Our drinks sat for at least 10 minutes before I'd raise them into the air for a refill.  I had to go into the restroom to grab extra paper towels because the staff was too busy jaw-jacking with one another.\n\nAfter seeing that I was annoyed, the server finally brought wet-naps, extra napkins, and crab smashers (we were already done eating).  \n\nNeedless to say, unless the quality goes up, I won't be returning... felt like I was eating at Home Town Buffet, but paying 4 times the price.",1
"I recently stayed at the Venetian for three nights.  This place is huge.  The lobby and casino are beautiful.  The pool is OK, needs less concrete and more vegetation.  Canyon Ranch spa is also huge but impersonal (see Qua Spa).   I was disappointed in the suite.  The rooms in the Venetian tower are large, but starting to show some wear from high use, the furniture is a little tacky.  I expected a better room for the money paid.  From what I hear the Venezia tower suites are much nicer.  Service was very good.\n\nSummary\nCasino 4/5\nHotel Room 3/5\nPool 3/5\nShopping 4/5\nDining Selection 4/5\nService 4/5\nCasino Luck 1/5",2
"This yogurt store is horrendous. \n\nI consider myself to be somewhat of a Fro Yo conossieur, and this place seriously didn't cut it for me. \n\nMe and a friend walked in, and there were no greetings whatsoever by any kind of employee. For that matter, the whole place was empty. No staff, nothing. \n\nSo, because there was a self serve sample station, we decided to get our own samples. Upon approaching the six or seven yogurt machines, we saw that the trays at the bottom hadn't been cleaned in ages. They were SATURATED with yogurt. And for those of you who don't know, yogurt is filled with probiotics and live cultures that, when not refrigerated, reproduce and make yogurt spoil and go bad. So, long story short, there was spoiled yogurt just sitting out in the open. \n\nSomehow, we weren't deterred at this point. We got our samples, and I almost vomitted. The yogurt in some of the machines literally tasted like it was sitting in there for weeks. It was spoiled. YES, spoiled. Rotten. Gone bad. This is understandable for a place that gets very little business in an area like the Pavillions, but it is still unacceptable to cut corners and serve disgusting product to customers. It was perhaps one of the grossest things I'd ever put in my mouth. \n\nThen, when we got to the register, we had to yell a bit to get the teenage boy out from the back room where he was hiding. We paid (for the few yogurt flavors that were not spoiled), ate, and then left. \n\n\nPros: \nCalorie count for all the flavors, per ounce. \nFlavor and topping combination suggestions. \n..... That's it. \n\nCons: \nDirty store, \nVirtually no service \nSpoiled yogurts. \n\nNeedless to say i will never be returning.",0
"It's an upscale burger joint with \""fusion\"" alternatives.\n\nBurger, Fries and a \""coke\"" for $20\n\n*Bachi Burger -   It's a fine line between caramelized and charred. My burger came charred. I ordered med-well and was advise it would be pink in the middle. I said,\""perfect\""....well, that wasn't the case when it showed up.\nThe Bun and Veggies were up to par. I ordered an egg with it and it was cooked perfectly. It was the patty that ruined the meal- the flakes of charred matter killed the burger. I couldn't even taste the red onion\n\n*Just Fries -  Over priced ($3.50) for plain skinny fries. \n\n*Root Beer -  Soda machine needs calibration. $2.50 for a flat soda. I asked for another and they cranked up the carbonation mix and it tasted too carbonated.\n\nThe only reason why the place gets 2 stars instead of 1 is the atmosphere and its employees.The manager was very apologetic and asked what she could do to make it up.\n\nSorry Bachi, I can get a decent burger, fries and \""coke\"" for $10 at fuddruckers or fatburger. And for a little over $5 I can get an In-n-out burger.\n\nFor $20 - go to the Eiffel Tower Restaurant inside Paris Hotel and Casino and order a Lamb Burger (5 stars). There's a dress code; so no flip-flops and shorts",1
"I usually journey to the Matthews Sports Clips whenever I need a cut, but it is nice to know that I can venture here if I am on this side of town.\n\nThis sports clips can get pretty busy, but I really like not having to make an appointment.  The last time I visited here it was pretty dead, but this time there were people waiting in the front... I was about to ask how long the wait was, but the stylist said, \""come on back.\""  I looked around, thinking \""I am going to get beat up by these guys that have been waiting for a while\""... but she quickly explained that they were waiting for someone in particular.  Score me.\n\nThe location is located below the main shopping area... I usually park and take the rather steep steps down to the location... but it still has all your usual Sports Clips features:  tvs galore, a ton of sports, and all the hair products.  \n\nI do like to mix it up every-once-in-a-while.  I think it's good to get someone else's opinion about certain hair products or what \""cut\"" is better for you.  After-all, hair grows back.  Molly, the stylist that was helping me out actually recommending another Crew product that I ended up liking so I picked up a puck.  I'm not a big fan of people pushing products on you, but Molly really explained the product to me and it was a no pressure to buy situation.\n\nProbably one of my favorite parts of the haircut is the shampoo and hot towel to the face.  I remember when I was younger, I would have to plan on going home and taking a shower to get all the stray hairs out.... the service that Sport Clips offers let's you get a haircut and go about your business.",2
"I booked this room on-line and was told it was a 4 star Resort. NOT .. This is one of the worst places I have ever stayed in Scottsdale, Az. Not only do you have to pay for a room you have to also pay $25.00 parking fee which I was never informed about. The rooms are older rooms with older wall unit A/C's that won't even cool down the room.  I would not recommend this place to anyone. It may be marked as 4 stars but it is more like a 1 star.. The only thing I can say positive about the stay is the pillow's were nice. I also forgot to add that as far as the internet service it was 3 megabytes and slow,slow slow.....plus while I was in the middle of something the internet went off .   It is an older place that has bright paint wanting to pretend that it is newer and up to date. NOT. I WOULD NOT STAY HERE EVER AGAIN even if they offered me a free night.",0
They deserve negative stars I heard that there is new owners and it shows from a terrific caterer to a terrible one I've used them for many charitable events it was always on point now I wouldn't recommend them to the dog pound,0

"I'll start off with the good.  My server was very nice and accommodating of my group's requests.  Prices are very reasonable and the portions are huge.  The decor is fun, festive, and funky.  Kinda makes you forget you're at the Waterfront.  Things really just started to go downhill when the food came out.\n\nThe fried chips and thin salsa roja didn't have a whole lot of flavor.  I'm not usually one to pass up on a big ol' bowl of chips and salsa, but this starter was just not appealing.\n\nI ordered option C from the \""Gran Agave Vegetarian Plates\"" section of the menu: one quesadilla with bean burrito and a chalupa.  I was expecting the quesadilla to be the star of the show, so I was pretty disappointed when I received a flat, tasteless quesadilla filled with nothing but cheese.  Is it too much to ask for some veggies in a vegetarian quesadilla??  The accompanying bean burrito was smothered in sauce, completely drowning the taco shell of the chalupa.  All in all, kind of a mess, and definitely not what I was expecting.\n\nMy boyfriend ordered the beef flautas, which were extremely dry and tasteless.  My parents, on the other hand, both enjoyed their meals.  But it may have had something to do with the shot of Patron and Dos Equis. Who knows.  \n\nI probably would not return to this restaurant, although I do appreciate the variety of Mexican food they offer, especially for vegetarians.  Portion sizes are extremely generous.  I'd recommend staying away from the \""Americanized\"" offerings and maybe trying something more authentic.",1
"Tonight I stopped by here to meet up with friends and ordered nachos and guacamole. These guys hand cooked their nachos so it takes a bit long before my food arrived but once I tried them, the wait time was worth it. I love the cheese covered nachos dipped in perfectly fresh guacamole. The only down side is that this is a very unhealthy item due to the frying of the nachos. Also, at ~$8 for nachos and guacamole and a diet Coke, that's kind of pricey I thought.",3
"Living in Avondale I was excited to check out this place due to the rave reviews.  I ordered the machaca chimi.  Delish!  The chips and pico are wonderful.  The other salsa is a runny, roasted chipotle (adobo) sauce - good and not too spicy.  I am a refried beans lover and I was unimpressed by the beans.  I'm old school and love REAL refried beans with lard - sorry, I just do.  These beans were clearly mashed with either cheese or milk....They tasted like they were from a can.  Mexican rice was very good.  Only 3 stars from me - food was decent but there are better alternatives.",2
"Came here on a normal weeknight with my buddies.  I looked at the menu, and I could not see the flat bread we ordered.  We wanted a flat bread and a side of meatballs as an appetizer, and the waiter suggested we put meatballs on the pizza instead.  It came out great.  I love suggestions like that.\n\nAs the main course, I had the pork chop.  Thick piece, cooked well. Very juicy.  The side of cherry peppers I could do without.  They were not sweet, I couldn't eat more than 1, and there was about 20 on the plate.",3
Ok rolls. Good but not too memorable drinks. Recommend it for the happy hour.,2
"My husband and I came here for a quick lunch. When we arrived there was a line even though there were empty tables around. From a quick look the restaurant was understaffed.  \nWe ordered the lunch special dynamite California roll and eel avocado roll and pork katsu. The eel avocado was a good deal only $5 and it was a more affordable lunch size version of the dragon roll. The sushi was delicious the best I've had in Arizona so far however the service was toooo slow.\n\nI had to go pick up chopsticks because servers were nowhere always busy ringing up the register. The only time they came to the table after we took our orders was to give and pick up the check. I really enjoyed the food, but the service needs to improve and they need to clean the tables because they were sticky ....",2
"We came to this fine establishment due to a time share gimmick that sounded great over the phone. I figured hey it's a Hilton, I should have a wonderful experience for my birthday! Wrong!  Can you hear the sound of the gong going off? Well I did! We were courteously greeted at the counter and we're welcomed with a wonderful bag that included 2 free bottles of water! Anyway moving past that we had to give our card keys to the elevator attendant when we wanted to go up to our rooms. I get it ! Safety is our number 1 priority!  But when there were several of my peeps from South Central Los Angeles staying at this fine establishment, I felt really safe! \nOnce we got up to our room it looked nice from afar. I had some books I brought to read and decided to place them on the side table and dust came flying off! Ok small detail. Then noticed walls were dirty, the place card on the bed was stained and had lipstick. As I proceeded to go to the bathroom the panel on the side of the bathroom was falling off. I must add that it was nicely stocked with soap and shampoo and the water pressure was good. \nLater in the afternoon we came back to our room after a long day of walking. We noticed we had next door neighbors. We went to dinner and got back to our room late. The party next door went on for a couple of hours. We waited an hour before calling the front desk to see if the noise level would decrease but it didn't.  I know it's Vegas and people are expected to party but be a bit more considerate. It was 1 in the morning. We called the front desk to let them know what was happening and assured me that they take these matters seriously.  Well the party continued for another hour. We had to bear it because we had no other choice. I did ask if we can have a different room and they said that we didn't have to move. Needles to say the next night wasn't any better. \n\nWe did not get to go to the pool because it was always packed. I know it's summer but there weren't enough lounge chairs available any of the times we wanted to go to the pool. I honestly expected a lot more from Hilton but I was truly disappointed in the quality of our room. If you are trying to gain potential time sharers then your rooms should reflect that.",0
"Turn down the grill. Our steaks were scorched and tough on the outside. Inside, they were great. That means it was a good piece of meat ruined by an idiot on the grill. At these prices, inexcusable!",0
Ok so im a local and come here pretty often.. the food is good and the portions are enormous. I have one big problem with this place -- the hostesses have been instructed to not seat guests in the booths unless you are 6 people?! We were 4 but were maybe going to be 5 and were not seated  until all guests arrived ( yikes - the restaurant wasnt even crowded ). Also had to basically almost have a fight to get the booth. Service is good here but hostesses need to lighten up and let customers have a booth especially when the restaurant isnt full ?! wtf?  Also... womens bathroom is disgusting. I brought this to the attention of the manager- but he really didnt care and the next time I was there it was just as bad :(..,2
"Let's that I'm not a big dancer, but I do enjoy good music.  Our friends dragged us there on a Friday night and we had a blast with music from 90's (most of it was).  The place was packed, but nevertheless there was room to dance and we didn't feel like everybody was invading our private space :-)  Cover charge was $5 + $2 for the coat check (not spring yet in case you didn't notice). Drinks prices are fair and there are plenty of bars to get them from.  You'll be pleasantly surprised that the 90's music still sounds amazing versus some of the stuff we hear these days!",2
"No, but seriously, I love this place. I would eat here everyday if I could. \n\nEither eating in, or taking it to go, the food and service is stellar. I've had a couple different appetizers and entrees and I've narrowed it down to two favorites. The Siamese Kisses app is fricken delicious and the Pad Thai is :drool: amazing. \n\nThey do their spice level from 1 to 5. 1 being no spice at all and 5 being Thai hot. Ive ordered the Pad Thai at a 3 and a 4 and I think I prefer the 3. Level 4 is definitely manageable but it kind of burns the tummy afterward.. Which is just slightly unpleasant. \n\nI absolutely love eating here and consider them my \""go to\"" for dining out. They also have a rewards card, which for every 200 points, you get a gift card. They also send you stuff for your birthday and anniversary. \n\nYummmmmmm!",4
"I have seen a handful of other Cirque shows (including the Elvis show Zarkana replaced), and this one was the least entertaining of the lot. Uninspired, dull, disjointed, and a bore. I read that Cirque brought one of their best shows to the Aria since the Elvis edition was a disappointment. With that information, I purchased tickets for my girlfriend's birthday, confident of its quality. She had never seen a Cirque show, and I figured this was a can't-miss. Whoops! Zarkana is a series of set-piece circus acts that do not link together in any fashion. Unlike other Cirque shows, there is no fluidity. A basic circus act (i.e. juggling, trapeze) is played out without any real creativity, the curtain closes, there is a brief skit by some clowns, repeat. It is as if Cirque has regressed from the normally dazzling, creative displays that are the norm. The quality in design and performers are the only \""highlights\"" that keep this thing from being a complete disaster. Zarkana? More like Zar-CAN'T-a! HIYO! ZING!",1
"Service is horrible. Pick-up was just ok, but vehicle was filthy and had trash in it. Attendant was same at pick-up and turn-in. She was dismissive and curt. Was visibly and audibly upset when I made her walk to the car at check-in and physically inspect the car for cleanliness, damage and a full tank. WARNING, YOU GET NO DOCUMENTATION OF ANY KIND AT TURN-IN. They just tell you you will get the final rental bill by email within 24 hrs. NEVER AGAIN WILL I RENT HERE!",0
"The worst public golf I've ever experienced in the many years I've been golfing with friends. We were approached on the 2nd hole on a Saturday morning and told that we had to play ready-ball!! It wasn't that busy so no need at all to be interrupted and hassled on several holes. The only reason my game got slowed down was because this Steve guy was watching us (distracting us) on every hole and asking for our receipts twice! Steve later on apologized, but when I told him I wanted a refund he never did anything . We had to skip the putting portion on several holes to get him off out backs. I didn't get what I paid for.",0
"Our first time trying in being new to the area. Pizzas is decent the wings were  a bust, tough, chewy, and could've been cooked a little bit more.  Did take out , and Original driver never did get here so I had to call and ask and they made a new order and send it out it was here in 22 minutes but overall time to get it was over over two hours.  They were very nice about it and offer to comp the entire meal so now I have a credit at the bar so to speak so we'll try that experience here the beer and atmosphere is good.",2

"I have visited his Bistro many times and have never been disappointed. The atmosphere and the servers have always been professional, helpful and they have a great laid back attitude. Our best experience has been with a server named Tim. His personality was over the top and made for a fabulous visit. On this last visit we had the stuffed mushroom appy which was great! I opted for a dinner salad with chicken and the sweet serrano dressing which I love. My friend had the margherita pizza and there were no complaints. We sat and chatted for quite a long time and never felt hurried by the staff to turn the table. One of my favorite places to go for great food with friends.",4

"Bleh. Has a weird  smell in the casino and definitely looks old. The \""plain jane\"" interior doesn't quite go with the unique exterior theme of pirates and booty. No one was ever in the cafe-restaurant-lounge-bar that they advertised so much (Kahunaville). Location-wise it is okay, but there's no hotel connected to it (like Aria-Cosmo or Bellagio-Caesars)...unless you count the tram to Mirage but meh.\n\nThe hotel rooms were also pretty meh. We had no inner shower curtain liner thing so our bathroom was very wet. Towels are small and rough. Not enough lighting unless you turned on every lamp and switch in the room, and even then, it was awkward. Mirrors/closet doors were also angled badly and very little outlets for charging phones. I really don't like this place, but maybe the suites will be better.",0
Don't go!!!! The service is that Bad!!! I went by myself and the server was that bad. Was a waste of money. Very RUDE workers.,0
"So I have never written a poor review before but I am overwhelmingly upset with the level of professionalism and care that they took that went from disturbing our meal to ruining our afternoon.\n\nSo to begin with we were seated almost immediately with a pretty empty hibachi area. This was not the first time eating here. Everyone was pleasant and I was expecting a good meal. The problems started immediately beginning with our incompetent cook. I am of the belief that eating at a hibachi place is 66% food and 33% presentation. A large part of the experience is the show. Within the 25 minutes of serving us, our cook flung hot butter on me, messed up both my wife's and my friends order, and burned the vegetables thoroughly, and messed up every attempted trick. Overall the food was bad and I was not happy with the service. I spoke first with the kitchen manager about it letting him know what happened and he was pleasant enough about it. I told him that this was definitely not worth the price and we were not happy with both the service and the food. He proceeded to tell me that he could do nothing to help me and I would be waiting for the manager. We waiting now for 20-30 more minutes and finished the rice and meat that was provided. Meanwhile the other table was cleaned using excessive amounts of cleaning spray making my sensitive wife almost choke at the chemical smell and taste in the air. No one came out to see us or ask our concern. Any goodwill from me that the kitchen manager tried to develop was gone. I went looking for the manager myself extremely upset that they would give us the run around. I did lose my cool, but most people would be in this situation.\n\nWhen I finally talked to her she claimed that she had been talking to other customers and felt that it would be rude to leave them and come find my problem. She proceeded to tell me that all the things I encountered were my fault and I was overreacting. At this point I started to lose it and blatantly asked her if this was a mcdonalds or does she actually think shes offering a better dining experience than this. She said that the 'food was good' (huh how would she know?) and they ' did not use heavy cleaning chemicals on their tables'. Then she had the most audacity to tell me that \""sometimes butter flies off the food. now if you were on fire or seriously injured then we might want to help you\"" Honestly, for sake of preserving human life I stormed out of there as quickly as possible with 0 tip on the receipt.\n\nHonestly I don't really blame the cook that much. I hate that they would be training him on our dime when he makes crap food but that happens sometimes. I am just so disgusted by the tone at the top of this small restaurant. They think that their customers are expendable and they refuse to acknowledge that their might be a problem with their management style and/or training procedures. This is not the place you want to take your family. There are so many many competitors in that area (Kobe, Ichiban, etc) that will have managers that will 100% respect you and understand the value of customer loyalty. If you eat there you will most likely not have the clusterfuck of a meal that I had, but I would not recommend taking the chance. Good luck and good eating!",0
"Panda Express...nothing new. But this one gets a review because the service alone sucked! The food warrants a \""meh\"". I was ignored and skipped at the beginning of the line, then screwed over at the end of it. Turns out, if you order any sort of shrimp entree, it's $1 extra. Is that posted anywhere? Nope! Orange chicken was kind of bland, the shrimp were good, and the egg rolls weren't so delicious?! After all the carbs, I was ready for a nap. Overall, not a good experience and won't be going back to this one.",1
"Hmmm...I feel old and reminiscent.  I like this vibe, reminds me of Manhattan, well more like an outskirts like Jersey City or Hoboken when I lived there. \n\nFood is a solid \""Good\"", but not necessarily memorable.

I like that, but at the same time, I won't be coming back unless I am trying to impress a 20-something.",3

The poutine was okay and the service was okay.  \n\nI could have sworn that in the past I've eaten poutine from a food truck and the gravy was so piping hot that the curds melted. \n\nOh well, maybe it was just my memories, but in the old montreal, there didn't seem to be too many dedicated poutineries to choose from.",2
