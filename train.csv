"This looks like a classy place to have dinner and a few cocktails with friends... We headed here for drinks after dining at Blanco. \n\nThe place was less busy than I remember, making us scoring a prime outdoor seating location possible... The seven of us enjoyed several well-made cocktails and had a very nice, attentive server.\n\nI will be back to sample their food and their renowned happy hour...",2
Best sauce on a pizza I have ever tasted.  There sandwiches are to die for....,4
"We came in here for pre-dinner drinks before hitting Sushi Roku. It was a Sunday so there were only a few other people here. Cocktails were TASTY. The atmosphere was chill and the bartender a bit chilly until he and my date started swapping bartender horror stories. By the time we left the bar we were all buddies. \n\nThis place is swank-hip and does attract a crowd largely consisting overdressed wanna-be's who take themselves WAY to seriously. While I wouldn't want to go out here and be in that environment all the time, the above clientele makes for GREAT people watching.\n\nNot a bad place, in my opinion to splurge once in a while.",2
Looks like they are applying for a liquor license...exciting!,2
"I am sold on the whole chicken and waffles thing!!!  I love LoLo's Chicken and waffles, they are by far the BEST southern food I have had.  I tried collards for the first time, on my most recent visit, fantastic!\nWay to go LoLo's!",4
"The location and atmosphere of this place is quite nice!  However, the menus we were given were all torn up at the corners, which was surprising for a pretty nice restaurant.  It definitely cheapened the place and lowered our expectations.\n\nI ordered the Watermelon Margarita and it was extremely good!  Most margarita's I had in Vegas were way too sweet, but this one was perfect.  \nWe also ordered chips and salsa - again, very good.  The chips were fresh and the salsa was spicy!\n\nOur meals (beef & chicken enchiladas) were very very bland.  After the spicy salsa with the chips and our server's warning of some spice in the meal, we were expecting something...but seriously - nope.  No spice, no flavor, bland, bland, bland.  \n\nOur server was very nice and attentive, which we found everywhere in Vegas - which is a really good thing.\n\nBut I would not go back here or recommend it to anyone going either.  Sorry!",1
"Eh- proof that horrible service will ruin any meal.  We come into this sushi place after a long hot day outside.  The server seats us and because my cousin recognizes her from her previous job at a restaurant further down the street, the server takes this as a hint to get overly friendly and comfortable.  She proceeds to tell us how this job is less stressful and that she makes more tips here (and tells us how much) b/c it's a different clientele, though she feels she never makes alot.  We've placed our order and we watch as people around us get their sushi, as well as people who come in for takeout get theirs.  Time's ticking and finally, we get the rolls we ordered, but not the sashimi...we devour the rolls and tick...tick...what seemed like an eternity later, we get the rest of our food.  The sushi itself is very fresh and good.  After we flag down the suddenly disappeared server for the check, we wait another 10-15 minutes for the check.  She proceeds to hover over us and take about how cash is better than credit cards, as we're trying to divy up the bill...so rude.  No wonder she doesn't make alot of tips...what an awful waitress.",0
"I've been dying to try this place hoping to recapture the fond memories of eating mouth watering lechon from Cebu and the famous steamed rice with pork and shrimp topping from Ding Hao. So last night I was in a spur of the moment mood and called to place an order to go. When I got there at 6 pm the place was totally empty, I thought uh oh I hope that's not an indication of inferior tasting food. Lechon, albeit the skin was crispy, the taste just wasn't there or I should say it's NOT what a normal lechon from Cebu tastes like. It needed more spices and I didn't detect the smell and taste of lemongrass which I think is a huge part of the flavor. The pork steamed rice wasn't good at all. It was too sweet and the texture was off. I really wanted to like this place so I'm very disappointed, but who knows maybe one day I might just try their other offerings.",1
"Great place to have drinks and delicious plates.  Kind of loud at times, therefore, I won't recommend it for a first date.  Service is excellent and reasonable prices.",2
"Another new concept and this time it is one that actually works mostly. If you sign up for the text club, they will send you pizza discounts and this is when you should go get your pie. I had a $7 any pizza text and decided to give it a whirl. The thing that needs improvement is that they only have one oven and it looks like only three pizzas can fit into that said oven at once. If your pizza can't fit, it sits on the messy table (in my case only 3 minutes) and it waits and waits to enter the oven and when its busy who knows what can land on that pizza with the open air arrangement. Anyway, after the pizza my way came out, it ended up pretty good. The chicken needs some improvement and the meatballs are pork and beef combined (not a fan), but I like the fact that it is the same price for anything you throw on there. The staff is kind of young and goofy also, maybe someone who looks over 21 would give the place more respectability.",2
"Nice place. Rooftop bar is beautiful and the different levels allow you to roam, but a few issues...1)when we got there, tables were open on the large outside seating area at the entrance, so when we grabbed two drinks inside we sat out there. When we were about 75% complete our drinks this snooty waiter who looked like Michael Phelps afflicted with an overbite  came over to us and said we need to \""go inside. Those drinks were bought inside.\"" We asked if we could finish them and order a few more drinks with him..he said \""no\""...avoiding any eye contact...There were no signs (in French or English) anywhere suggesting u cldnt bring ur drinks from inside outside and when we questioned him on that as well as why other patrons outside had glasses like ours, he couldn't really answer. Also, when you are outside and you want to pay by credit card, you have to follow the server inside to the bar and run the card there. Slight annoyance but dumb. Second waiter was more pleasant than the first guy who gave us hassles and it is a great place to watch the hot messes parade up and down the main strip at Le Village, so I still give it 3 stars.",2
"This place is the BOMB!  My family is from Louisiana, therefore I'm familiar with the way crawfish is supposed to taste.  This restaurant is by far the best place I've ever been outside my family's kitchen. \n\nWarning: The Spicy Hot & Juicy seasoning is just that, SPICY!!! But so GOOD!!!",4
"I'm a big fan of Bobby Flay's shows (Iron Chef & Beat Bobby Flay) so I decided to splurge and take my family here for Thanksgiving dinner while visiting Vegas.\n\nBig mistake.\n\nThe food is way overpriced for what you get.  You're basically paying for the name instead of quality food.  Basic cocktails are $12+.  Desserts are $11 and not big enough to share (no I'm not a pig either).  \n\nI ordered the pork tenderloin which was $36 for 3 tiny pieces (c'mon, it's not sushi!) and a very dry tasteless \""tamale\"".  My dad and my wife had the turkey dinner for $38, again very small portions and they later told me it was cold!  My 12 year old son had the salmon which he really enjoyed, but for $32 can't you at least include 1 side??!!\n\nThe best thing I can say about the restaurant is the bread basket!  The waiter warned us of the \""spicy\"" bread which was not spicy at all - just a couple bits of jalapeno, but the cheese crust was delicious.\n\nThe service was ok, but nothing special.  It took forever to get our food (we were there for 2 hours), but I can understand that due to the holiday.  The icing on the cake was walking out and nobody at the hostess bar said thanks for coming.  After dropping $280 for 3 adults and 3 kids, I will definitely not be back!",0
There was a Groupon for Papa Murphys so we thought we would try it. I'm glad I only paid $10. I've had better frozen pizza.,1
"Li'l Porgy's good food, fast service.Top of the line B.B.Q. best in town? No, but pretty darn good, and you can see it cooking over the wood.As for the  complaint of soggy bread ask for your sauce on the side,they don't have a problem doing that for you. I do that all the time, long drive home and the bun will get soggy.The fries are always under cooked, you have to look at that as a good thing if you get it to go, you get home and finish them off and you get nice hot and crunchy fries. The tub o tips with hot sauce will take care of any B.B.Q. craving. I have never had poorly or over cook meat of any kind here.",3
"Previously I gave them 5 stars, but now only 2. As the technician just solve the problem with my AC for couple of weeks. So, when he came he diagnosed freon leak. So, he just add freon and even didn't try to search for leak. So, as the leak wasn't fixed by him, the freon that he added leaked after two weeks and again my AC WAS BLOWING WARM AIR.",1
"If you are coming to Vegas, definitely use Free Vegas Club passes! \n\nCheck out the website and choose the events or clubs depending on the date because each day, there might be a different deal! For instance, there might be one that offers free admission, while another one offers free drinks til midnight etc. So definitely, plan ahead (or not). \n\nChris is very responsive via text and makes sure your experience is flawless. When I told him I was looking for something to do after clubbing he immediately sent us a limo to a strip club and hooked us up with free drinks. This one time, the limo driver who was supposed to drive us back to our hotel did not show up for 30mins, so we took a taxi to our hotel. I told my concern to Chris and he even paid for my cabfare. I was very pleased and suprised by his gesture!\n\nI definitely recommend FVCP! It will make your Vegas experience more convenient and fun. \n\nIn short: free dranks, vip access and skip lines!",4
"This is for the famous shrimp cocktail...\n\nHave been going to the GG for shrimp cocktail for years and years.  It's always the same... great.  The shrimps aren't huge, but this is by far the best cocktail sauce.  The perfect combination of cold shrimp, cold sauce, a squeeze of lemon, and some crackers  for the dippin'.  At $1.99... this is a no brainer.  You can't go downtown without going for the Golden Gate shrimp cocktail.  And their homemade potato chips are pretty damn good too.  Play a little in the pit and the pit bosses will happily give you coupons for the shrimp.  ENJOY!",4
"Firefly needs their own entrance because walking through the Plaza just set the WRONG mood. It was as if, we had been transported back to some really bad, early 80's movie, and the patrons were slightly Deliverance like. Ay-Mommy!!!  Even the escalator had seen better days and don't get me started with the funky cigarette smell. The place needs to be detonated!\n\nLet me preface the food review by saying, I came expecting to be impressed. Well Ok, more like fed because it wasn't Espa\u00f1a and I have super high standards for tapas.  Oh how I wanted to like you, but at every turn I was rebuffed. It wasn't quite a ghost town, but it might as well have been. It was a sad state of affairs. \n\nGood- The Fremont Experience View & Getting reservations easily through Open Table. The steak was just about the only thing edible.\n\nBad- Lackluster waitstaff - Yeah, I understand- If I worked in a restaurant, in the crumbling and oh so sketchy Plaza Hotel, I too might not feel all that chipper either, but COME ON! Muster up a little faux excitement for newbies-- pretty please!!!! \n\nUgly -Just about everything we had was better off left in the kitchen. We tried the dates and I can do better at home. We tried the ham and cheese. Argh!! The fondue tasted like sweaty gym socks. The meats were like chewy leather. The salad was aight, but salads should not be a measuring stick.  The drinks were blah. I guess the atmosphere sans a large group was just plain lame. \n\nThey need to revamp the menu and relocate away from a location in decline.",1
"and almost three months AFTER my unfortunate visit to Prive, Cameron, the promotor texts me 'if you're ever in vegas again, let me know if i can hook you up!\""  oh and he's already working for a different club called OUT now??  bleeeeh.",0
"First time visited Las Vegas as the wedding invitation of my little sister. I searched on Booking apps and found \""the D\"", which stay on the middle street in downtown Vegas at s amazing price. I chose \""the D\"" and not really happy with my choice.\n\nI got the King size room at 33 floors and I am feel okay with my room at that price. The service here is great but the wall room is so thin, I mean I can hear everything voice next room lol. yes I did,  you can imagine lol.\n\nThey charge me extra money of the room because It was on weekend and the Booking apps didnt update yet. (f*ck) and I have to pay or I can choose another hotel. okay paid for it. \n\nhmmm ...",2
"This is a great team.  Bonnie is efficient, courteous, and flexible.  She drove 45+ minutes across the valley to come meet with me after work one day.  She returns phone calls very quickly, and helps to save me money.  Thank you so much for all that you do, Bonnie - your hard work is appreciated!!!",4
"Well, this used to be an on-strip outdoor attraction that featured pirates waging battle at the TI lagoon. Now the show features woefully untalented pirates booty (the sirens I guess) lip-synching to absolutely horrible music. The crowds get huge before the show, and it really is not worth the time.......especially, as they often do, cancel the show because of it being too windy. So do yourself a favor and blow by this attraction.",1
"Very, very poor customer service. I was just on the phone with an older woman trying to explain what was going on with my car (so that she could direct me to the right department) and she was unfriendly, rude, not helpful and then transferred my call when I was mid sentence! I was already a little hesitant about calling the dealership, since I am not the most knowledgable when it comes to cars. I am definitely not going to Shadyside Honda to service my car.",0
I come here often because it's in my hood and who doesn't like frozen yogurt? I always get the cake batter yogurt. It's a mom and pop joint so they don't have a large selection but enough choices to choose from.\n\nThey have all my favorite toppings so I'm satisfied. The employees always greet me and service is never an issue. It's a cute place to take your kids and to satisfy your sweet tooth during the scorching Vegas summers.,4
"Not a bad hotel to spend a few days at. Located along a stretch of road where there seems to be every chain restaurant known to man and just as many hotels. Yes, this location is a bit older and can use an upgrade but overall is pretty nice.\n\nClean rooms with comfortable beds\nFree breakfast each morning\nPool and hot tub\nExercise room\nFree wifi in all rooms\nBusiness office to use for free\nFree use of a terrific local health club\nFree cookies and candy in the lobby\nOn site guest laundry\nNew LG flat screen tv in room\nNice bathrooms with super hot water\nVery friendly and helpful staff\n\nConveniently located and not too far from Phoenix, Scottsdale, and Gilbert. Lots of shopping close by too with malls and other department stores. Also, many bars and restaurants within walking distance. Still, the surrounding area is a bit sleepy as most places close around 9-10PM. Ho-hum.\n\nBook on-line for discounts depending on length of stay, as five nights offered an 18% discount off the normal rate.",2
"Others I have known have received spectacular bouquets from them, and so I decided to use them as well on two different occasions.  Both were funeral services, and both flowers were very disappointing.  The first was a $75 poinsettia for a holiday memorial, which didn't look as good as I could have bought in a grocery store.  The second was a funeral spray with yellow carnations and some huge sunflowers.  I don't like sunflowers at all, and don't think they belong in a funeral spray.  But I left it up to the florist to make the decision on which flowers to use.  Won't make that mistake again.",1
"yummy yummy. I'm going to have to take an extra hot yoga class for this. just got a everything bagel with a mile high pile of cream cheese, too much cream cheese for the bagel but I'm just gonna eat it with my finger.",4
My Hawaiian family loves it here everytime my stepmom comes in off the road she's has a special place for them and I've grown more and more accustom to their kula pig great to go if your in town,4
"After walking by here several times I really wanted to have one of those amazing looking milkshakes.  I got the fluffer nutter, because I love peanut butter and chocolate together.  I watched the lady make the milkshake.  I saw her pull out the gallon of D milk and I thought \""great, this is super fattening.\""  I saw her pull out the jar of Skippy peanut butter and I thouht \""great, this is something I could have made at home.\""  \n\nIt came in a plastic cup that looked smaller than the pictures and there were no Reese's Peanut Butter Cup bits on the top like in the picture.  I didn't say anyting but I was pretty disappointed it did not live up to the picture and description for a $9 milkshake.",1
"Wow.  Despite the great reviews of the doctors, it isn't worth it!  I hope the office manager realizes what a terrible staff this place has.  Please note that I don't give low ratings very often.  It was just that bad.",0
"My wife and I had supper here a few weeks ago. On the whole, we enjoyed our meal and will eat there again.\n\nMy wife had the Caesar salad (mixed romaine and other lettuce (?), good dressing a bit heavy on the mustard, and lots of croutons). She liked it. I'm a bit more particular (some might say peculiar) about my Caesar salads.\n\nWe had the tomato basil mozzarella pizza with onions and sausage. The sauce was a bit on the strong side. Overall, it had good flavor, and a very nice crisp and chewy crust. But why was it not steaming hot from the oven? Was it sitting on a shelf somewhere waiting to be served to us? The place was practically empty, though they seemed to be doing a fair amount of take-out and delivery business.\n\nI ordered the meatball appetizer to go (for a lunch sandwich later in the week), which turned out to be a really good choice.\n\nFountain drink refills are 50 cents.",2
"Awesome Pizza! The place gets packed, this is good and bad! Long lines but exciting atmosphere, and if its busy means you're getting fresher Pizza, so if you are hitting up clubs in Scottsdale definitely a must try at least once!",3
"This place was awesome.  I was up near Scottsdale and wanted to take some friends to Greek so I checked Yelp the reviews did not disappoint.  I got the Gyro platter.  It was a ton of food.  The meat was great and the pitas were fresh.  Plenty of tzatziki.  One of the best Greek salads I've ever had with plenty of cheese and it was very flavorful.  The rice and potatoes were really good too and I usually don't get to excited about those at a greek place.  I also sampled the falafel (good), baklava (great), and the spanikopita (amazing).  I sort of wish this place was closer to my side of town so I could go there more often.",4
"I've only been here once, to see a friend's band, The Delta Bombers, play.\n\nI like the atmosphere...the room the band played in was pretty small though, and it filled up fast.\n\nDrinks were expensive...but I guess they were kind of standard for Freemont street.  I pulled up a recipe for the bartender, since I wanted to try something new, and he nailed it.  It was a really really good drink.  \n\nI'd probably come back again.",2
"I brought my father here because it was the only place open over the weekend. He got treated right away. The doctor and the staff were very helpful.  We really appreciated their attentiveness and promptness. My father was helped with the symptoms, left the clinic feeling better, with prescription and treatment plan that his regular doctor fully approved. The facility was clean and well stocked. I highly recommend it.",4
"The idea of Bookmans is great. Used books, movies, games, etc brought in by fellow book, movie, and game lovers so you can then purchase them at a lower price. Its the execution that needs a lot of work. I used to come in here a lot. And two years ago I probably would have rated it a lot higher than I am rating it today. I heard about this place from a family member and how you can bring in books you don't want anymore and get either store credit or cash. OMG! That is the best idea ever. Getting rid of something you don't want and then picking something out that you do! What a concept! I did this I think three or four times a few years back and was always happy with the return from books I had. I would check out the store while they were evaluating my selection and then come back with a handful of new books to buy after they told me what they would give me for mine. \n\nThe last time I came in here I brought in easily $100 worth of brand new cookbooks that I don't use anymore since becoming vegetarian. They were new cookbooks so I thought I was going to get a great deal. They wanted almost all of them, and then wanted to give me $4. Yes... $4. Umm... are these people on crack?!!? So I said, hell no and walked out with my books and then went and sold them on Amazon for almost $75. \n\nThe selection in this store is also really crappy. I looked at the cookbook section the last time I was in here, and I had never even heard of most of the books they had here. And trust me, I know what I am talking about. I am the girl you see in Barnes and Noble sitting in the cookbook section for four hours on the weekends. They were all old and tired and books obviously nobody wanted, which is why they were in this store. \n\nI wont be coming back here.",1
"Nice casual off the Aria Casino/Lobby -- away from the frenzy.  Very friendly wait staff, delightful Cobb salad at lunch.",2
"Ughhhh I walked out of this restaurant with a sick and heavy feeling in my stomach.  I'm sorry stomach, never again!\n\nMy friend ordered the quadruple bypass, and I ordered the single.  The single was way more than enough lard and meat for me.  Just to complete the whole experience we ordered the flat liner fries too.  BAD CHOICE.  The first one was tasty, the ones that followed started tasting more like soggy potatoes dipped in lard.  \n\nThe quad was just pure insanity and my friend finished it.  D: He liked it but I was on the side ready to jump up if any CPR was needed.\n\nThe ambiance was cute.  Nurse waiters and waitresses, clever movie posters that parody the grill, and patient gowns for everyone!  \n\nArtery clogging food is definitely the main game of this place.  If you really want to have a myocardial infarction, eat here.",1
"when having dim sum, you've got to have the proper service to go with it in order to enjoy it.  If the right variety of carts don't come around to your table it can totally affect your dim sum dining experience.  I usually don't write reviews based on the service but during a dim sum experience its all about the service.  It was also hard for us to enjoy the dim sum especially since we had to wait so long for the soy sauce/chili oil to get delivered.  The dim sum was not bad but they lost a star and 1/2 due to the lack of service.  The only plus is the location at the Rio, which is one of my favorite hotel/casinos. =)",1
Needed to grab some food after being at the Cigar Bar..was a nice sports bar.. I had the pastrami sliders and loaded french fries.. and OMG was it good! I want to try everything on thier menu! Their prices were good too!,3
"Save yourself time and aggravation. I ran in for a quick fix last Thursday. That was simple and easy enough, so I made an appointment for Monday at noon for mani pedi. I drove 15 mins to get there and even though their sign says they are open, the shop was closed. On top of that, i decided to wait and have lunch across the street because I really needed my pedi before my trip. I waited for 1.5 hours and they never showed up or opened up. What a joke and a total waste of time. Very unprofessional. I would NOT recommend to anyone.",0
After two prior good experiences at Elite today did not go well.  Made an appointment and dropped my dog off at 1:00.  They took over 5 hours to finish....just a bath and tidy.  Not sure what they were doing all day but it shouldn't take over 5 hours to groom a dog especially when you have an appointment.\nProbably won't be going back.,1
"After coming here with some friends because of all the good things I've heard about the one in NY, I would advise you to avoid this place. \n\nI originally would have rated Serendipity 3 maybe two or three stars, more because of the ambience and its cutesy decor, and our service was pretty good, but everything we ate was VERY subpar and overpriced. Why one star then? Well..\n\nAfter I paid about $36 (tips included) for a $14 drink and a lame-ass $16 sandwich, I went home and spent the rest of the night doubled over with extreme, vastly unpleasant stomach pain. I don't know which food item caused it, but I'm talking about stomach pain that made me want to curl up next to the toilet and wish I had never visited Serendipity 3. \n\nWe started off with a frozen hot chocolate for my friend and a \""Raspberry Truffle\"" (frozen hot choc + chambord + some other things) for me. The frozen hot chocolate was okay but I've had much better in Austin. The \""Raspberry Truffle\"" was decent-tasting and was HUGE but the chocolate shavings and such were tasteless and didn't add much to the drink. Also, it got way too sweet after awhile so I didn't finish it.\n\nNext, entrees. My friend's salad looked mediocre. But $15 for a small-ish BBQ chicken pizza that Pizza Hut could have made better? And here's what I got.. $16 for an \""Open Bries\"" sandwich with one slice of bread, a mound of sliced turkey very much like the packaged kind one gets at their local supermarket, a few slices of apple and some mayo with cranberries, topped with a few slices of brie? Yeah the sandwich was kind of huge, not to mention ridiculously hard to eat, but  the side that came with it (excellently seasoned waffle fries) was far tastier than the main dish. The concoction would have been better had it been fresh turkey.. not to mention more deserving of the $16 price tag.\n\nDon't come here.. not worth the price and potential wrath of hell to be instilled in your stomach.",0
Horrible.,0
"This wasn't an impressive buffet even for the price of ten bucks at lunch. Granted, they were carving a few meats, but none of them I personally liked. The rest of the buffet was pretty much amateur hour. The highlight was the chicken enchilada's and maybe the grilled cheese sandwiches and mexican rice. They had a weird dim sum area, but it looked like unless you were asian, you would have no clue how to order and a large tip jar also deterred me (sorry, I already payed). The soups were average and it's time to get rid of baked Potato bars around the country already. The dessert area was looking quite old, but if you must try the creme brulee cups. Average food for a good price.",1
My family is a big fan of sushi  - this is our favorite in our area. The service is always good and the sushi is always fresh and tasty. \n\nMy only complaint is that the place is a bit small and when you walk in you're never greeted - and we always end up standing in the entrance of the dining area for more than a few minutes. \n\nOther than that - I highly recommend and know I will be back to get my sushi-fix when needed!,3
"I've never been to Italy, but this is probably the closest you'll come to eating a fine Italian meal in the valley of the sun. Freshness and quality, combined with great service make this restaurant a gem to behold in the rich culinary diversity of Scottsdale.\n\nRight upon seating you are served some fresh toasted bread drizzled with olive oil. The bread slices were perfect, a good balance of crisp crust with soft, slightly chewy center. The olive oil was high quality and was very flavorful.\n\nWe ordered a variety of dishes, from pizza, to a remarkable seafood platter, to pasta. I ordered the black pasta. The pasta itself is hand made fresh, with the addition of squid ink to give it its signature dark color. I was excited to try this dish out since I've never had squid ink pasta before, and I was impressed. The pasta was cooked perfectly, with a slight salty, deep briny flavor. It went well with the sauce, langostinos, and scallops. I also tried some of the margherita pizza, which was superbly executed with a thin, crispy crust and lovely toppings. I also tried part of a meatball which was perfectly seasoned, with a delightful soft texture. My friend that had the impressive seafood platter (Lobster, clams, scallops, and possibly more!) enjoyed his meal overall, but did remark that the clams were gritty.\n\nService was very polite and impeccable. Drinks were refilled quite often, and we were checked on as needed.\n\nParking in this plaza is a bit of a pain since there are limited spots, but they do make up for it by offering free valet.\n\nThis is definitely a new favorite for Italian food for me!",3
"I've eaten at quite a few Indian places. From the other reviews and closeness to me, I wanted to like this place. However, after going, I can't. The service was inattentive, and the food wasn't what I had expected. It became very apparent to me that the place does not have an tandoor, or if they do its not used. The chicken was cooked in the sauce, but had not been spiced before. Their scale for rating the spiciness of the food [1-5] was unhelpful as that they didn't compare what a 5 is and whats a 1. Lastly, the spices used to make the dish spicy weren't dried peppers, they were full undried peppers. [The dried version takes in the moisture of the sauce and becomes part of it, the undried version doesn't]\n\nLastly, the naan bred was what appeared to be buttered pita bread.\n\nPrice: For an Indian restaurant, this was very cheap.",0
"Really nice rooms and great views! The location is fantastic, with it being right near Downtown Montreal and a 10-minute walk away from Old Montreal. It's also right beside Metro Station Bonaventure and Montreal Grand Central Station, making getting around really convenient.\n\nThe room amenities are great. (Who doesn't love free wi-fi?) The mini-bar is stocked with awesome snacks and drinks, which come at a small price, but whatevs.\n\nThe only complaints that I have are regarding the TV in our room, which had a remote with no batteries in it, and the concierge desk, for which there was no concierge. Overall, though, a really nice hotel.",3

"As a New Yorker, I was looking forward to trying out Chompie's since all my friends have said that I would love it. When I walked in, I could see why - The decor was New York themed, with the Yankees taking up a whole wall in the back and Broadway posters lining the walls by the bathroom. I sat down and looked at the menu, where I saw many familiar offerings.\n\nAfter receiving my food, however, I was disappointed. The Chopped Steak was bland and tasteless. I could not finish it. My friends that ordered other dishes didn't seem to like their meals either. The salad was okay, the fries pretty good. I would not come back for the food.\n\nThe service was lackluster too; waitresses did not refill the water often enough, and my friends soon resorted to sticking ice cubes in their mouth while waiting.\n\nVery disappointed.",1
"First,  let me confirm that this establishment has not 1, but 2 restrooms.   One for ladies and one for men.   A fellow Yelper and I exchanged messages about this before I went because that Yelper's review states that Bei does not have a restroom for customers.  It does.   The sign out front is for non-customers.  I snapped a pic of the restroom sign as evidence for others reading reviews and considering this establishment----- because I almost bypassed this restaurant because of that Yelper's information. I hope this helps.\n\nLately,  I have been into Ramen and brothy soups in general.   Miso, shrimp and pork ramen to be specific.   Take a look at the picture of my Ramen http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/bei-scottsdale-2?selected=ovAcABgI3P5BFBUiBYQ9KA#xSczojjTQAVoXmEqcY19yw and view the pic of the Ramen posted by Yelper Britt C.  http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/bei-scottsdale-2?selected=ovAcABgI3P5BFBUiBYQ9KA#Gx2-zZuvY5ynZbUD27BlpA  They look quite different.   Mine had a few tiny pieces of meat, a limited amount of veggies and lacked adequate broth.   I hated it!  I can honestly say the 25 cent pack of ramen I made in college was better!  The veggies tasted canned. I expected a nice piece of pork in the Ramen like the aforementioned picture by Britt C, but there were only a few flavorless tiny pieces. A well known improvisational restaurant, that has monthly ramen nights, down the street has ruined my palate to tolerate ramen any place else.   I can not say how much I hated that dish!   \n\nI ordered a spicy sushi roll that I split with a fellow Yelper.  Decent roll.  I would like to try the Bei roll one day. \n\nI went here with the international lunch group that I organize.   Everyone else ordered a bento lunch box.  They were all happy with their lunch and had a consensus 3 star meal.\n\nThere were 6 of us,  we were automatically charged a 20% gratuity.   I don't know if this is normal for everyone or if that is the case for groups.   It was not printed on the menu.   It aggravated me,  but alas wasn't a big deal.   They should print that on their menu.\n\n2 stars - I hated my dish.\n\nBecause the location is cool for me for easy access to sushi in SoScott, but considering the proximity of other sushi restos that I like better:\nReturn Factor: 15%, \n\n.",1

"I've been going to this place for awhile because eating \""banh mi\"" is nostalgic to my childhood.  And it's comfort food next to eating \""pho.\""  I also keeping going back because its the only place that sells it in Chandler.  BUT... I must agree with others that they are skimping on the meat more and more each day.  AND today they skimped on the cilantro and pickled carrots/daikon.  SERIOUSLY?!  Have no clue why the wait is so long since they have so many employees standing around.  The french coffee is not traditional since they don't actually use a presser on each order, but instead its pre-mixed from their corporate office and tastes a bit chemical like.  Need to open my own banh mi shop and stop complaining :)",1
"seldom go here now that winco has most of my business but I can say the staff here is always willing to help and very nice. they have a selection of craft beers and u can build your own six pack, also they seem to have renovated the store, go HERE instead of the Walgreen across the street, youll be treated like shit.",2
The new Down Under Wines & Bistro is a vast improvement over the old place.  The staff is friendly but this place can get crowded and service can suffer as a result. I like the many unique food items they provide and they carry many of my Arizona wines and host great events for me.  If your on the East side or in Gilbert I would check it out.,3
"If you need something other than a taco or hamburger for a quick meal, try Panda for sure....\n\n1.  Chinese Food - Okay, it ain't really authentic, but close.  Too much generic vegetables like carrot and celery to fill up the dishes.  However, the food is not terrible at all.  Just kind of slopped together and kinda like putting ketchup on your scrambled egg or getting those fried chicken  meals from Albertsons or Smiths. \n\n2. Parties, Guests, Office - If you have a staff of people, you can order party trays and this is a great deal. Somehow, even though the food is decent at best, somehow when you put them in aluminum trays and big servings, it tastes better..... People that are not native to the food will find it quite edible.\n\n3.  Authenticity - I rarely see any Chinese people ordering from here. It is like going to Del Taco expecting real authentic Mexican food. You are getting the hybrid here.\n\nYou can order a side of Chow Mein and Side of Fried Rice in a party tray and it is like only 11.00 each. Now that is a great deal, \n\nTry it...you won't mind.",2
"Love Blue Fin!  The fish is grubbin' and the staff is very nice and accommodating.  I usually like to stop in after class for the dinner time eats and have come a few times during lunch to chow down.  Although I'm usually a fan of baked mussels, I'm not a fan of the one they serve here.  Like Chris V. said, it's more a lasagna/pizza approach when I'm used to the sparingly sauced types of baked mussels out in the valley.  Other than that, Blue Fin does stellar and continually warrants repeated visits from time to time.  Try out the Mexican roll and the Hawaiian roll.. both of my favs.  Enjoy!",3
Overpriced \nIcky \nNot New York pizza. \nMade my tummy hurt. \nI don't recommend going there but I gave it two stars because pizza is pizza. You're just better off with dominos or Pizza Hut.,1
Unfortunately I had a very bad experience.\nI was looking forward to my appt as I liked Marie J on initial consultation but the facial was really bad . My skin is quite inflamed after combination of microdermabrasion and aggressive extraction.I didn't get any pampering that I thought I would after paying 75$ nor did I get basics like steaming.Towels were uncomfortably hot rather warm.\nWill never go back.,0
"Huge portions and great presentation, but the food isn't very flavorful. Last time we went, we waited a lot longer than they originally told us. We noticed some people were being seated before us, even though they came way after us. After complaining, they sat us down. This was our second time here and I'm still not impressed. There are so many better breakfast places in vegas. This will be our last time.",2
"I work for a well known dealership, here in the Valley. Needless to say, I have a lot of contact with various automotive related vendors. Jesse really stands out as being exceptional!\n\nI called Jesse, and left a message at around 7am. Within minutes, Jesse called me back, on a Saturday nonetheless!! ! I explained that my vehicle was inoperable due to the windshield's condition. Jesse actually rearranged his schedule to accommodate us. \n\nI cannot fully express my gratitude to Jesse. He was prompt, courteous, and truly someone I will recommend to anyone.\n\nWhy use the big guys, when its glaringly obvious that \""the little guy\"" is the man for the job?!",4
"What an awesome dentist!\n\nThe staff is very friendly, professional and on top of their game.  I was looking for a dentist for the whole family that was close to home and this was it.  Ratings on other review sites brought me here.\n\nDr. Davis and Staff are great at what they do.  They have done some work on my wife and I.   I trust them with my whole family!  I like the ambiance of their office and the friendly overtone in general. \n\nMy wife is always nervous with the dentist and they were no exception.  They took the extra mile to make sure her experience was a pleasant one.\n\nGreat location, clean, warm, friendly, professional.  I am definately referring everyone I know to this dentist.",4
"Very good, took my family here and we all came out very satisfied.\n\nThe tempura rolls are very very good, and so was the spicy tuna. I would definitely come back to this place next time I visit LV.\n\nThe staff was very nice and very courteous, you can't go wrong with this spot.",3
"Mario did a great job on the dishwasher.   HOWEVER, when repairing a lamp that originally cost $339.00 was broken, Mario offered to replace it.   New lamp cost $149.00 and we were told that he would take the cost of the repair for the lamp he broke, from this price.   Hmmmm so I pay to fix a lamp that you  broke?",0
"Nice little Mexican joint in North Scottsdale - puff puff pass please wink!  Literally, just pass.  Parking is limited for such large place so I wonder what happens during rush hour, or maybe they didn't expect any rush!  The food - tacos, nachos, chimichungas, etc....nothing too impressive, but I can't say I was dissatisfied.  I didn't expect much so I wasn't too disappointed.  I ordered a couple of drinks and maybe I should have ordered more to drown out the sorrow of this experience!  Our service was good at least I can say, but then again we were one of the two customers around :(  - Enjoy...or not.",1
This place is completely overrated. It's a Korean infused Noodles & Company at best. It blows my mind to hear that people are waiting almost 2 hours to eat here. Don't waste your time and money. Madison has way better to offer.,0
"I\nThey re-opened under new mgmt.\n\n love the chicken friend chicken, it is sooo crispy.  I feel like I\""m in a dark hole though when I\""m there.  Interesting menu.  Wow I just read they closed last night for good.",2
"First time here and we'll return.  \n\nFresh food, good prices and you can bring your dog and sit outside.  I loved the selection of meats and toppings.  My husband had 2 chicken tacos and I had a chicken enchilada.  All very tasty.",3

Got a mani and pedi. Liked the amount of stuff they do for the cost. I didn't like that they didn't seem to have the AC on and I still had some nail polish on my skin. Overall a good place.,3
"Beware. If you order a lot they will start charging you double for your drinks. Sushi was so-so, nothing special. It's $15 AYCE so what do you expect. I was still nice and gave a $5 tip but never again. Go up the street to Sushi Bomb and pay the extra $5 for way better service and sushi.",0
"the food was just ok, the service was nothing to write home about, and the decor/ambience was kinda blah and uninspiring. It would probably take a major retread to make me interested enough to come back.",2
"I feel like the place is insanely pretentious.  I dunno why I get that vibe, but I do.  That said, their food is pretty damn good and isn't as expensive as you might expect considering the way they present everything.  \n\nThe place is interesting I guess.  It has neat bathrooms, kind of a cool looking bar, and modern seating everywhere.  Everything is very modern, and if you're into that kind of thing, then here is your spot.  \n\nPerhaps it is just too image conscious for me.  I just don't like it.",2
THE BEST RESTAURANT IN LAS VEGAS HANDS DOWN.  Everything is well thought out and fascinating.  Have never had a bad experience here.  The tasting menus are must trys.,4
"This would be a great place except for one thing, everything is in french. Now this is great if you are looking for french manga, but in Montreal you'd think they could have some english manga, among their collection of 3000 books. So if you're looking for english manga, there is absolutly none to be had here, just book shelves and book shelves of dissapointment.",0
"Again, I like the food here and the prices are always very good.\nYa, ya, bad nieghborhood.  Just watch your back. LOL.\nThe wait staff sucked on my last visit.  Brought someone that had never been here for\nthe $3.99 10oz. Burger & Fries, we waited 10 minutes to get served and probably another 8-10 minutes after our meal was done.  You just shouldn't have to sit in front of your empty plate.  Go for the food, just plan to be there for a bit.",1
"Ok ok I get what the hype is all about now! This place is pretty cool! This particular location has a great outdoor patio area! Also on this day they were serving half off their bottles of wine! How does that not make you like the place even more already! They have a pretty decent wine selection (mostly the basics) and a nice food selection. You can get anything from nachos to ramen noodles! I have never had ramen noodles at a restaurant before, so I am thinking I will have to try that the next time I come here. We came more for drinks and hanging out then we did the food, so I split the nachos and street tacos with a friend. The meat had a great taste to it, the guacamole was fresh and the chips were nice and crispy! We were here for quite a long time and our waitress was very helpful with drink selections and answering questions, we were even able to sample a few different wines. It was nice that she kept checking back with us to make sure we were doing well, even after we finished our meals.\n\nGreat new trendy place to stop in and check out. I am interested in going back and trying more of the food!",3
"In the day, before I had any incline of indie coffee chains(pre Yelp) and when my favourite place to chill out after work was Waterstones, the coffee supplied by its previous occupiers, was more than just well coffee...I mostly went there for the banter, from the baristas.\n\nSo tell me Edinburgh what's happened to this bookywooky shop? Really do nice cakes make up for the gapping chasm of friendliness and passion that used to lure me back week upon week; I think not! Somehow it has left me less warm to the chain since the renovation, just like a random wifi connection.\n\nYep the black/cream walls could do with a good lick of paint, the toilets could be more welcoming, the dwindling book stock could be more...stocky! New coffee team, different position of the coffee shop(why change it if it ain't broken) this place is in real danger of of going either one of two ways. Either turning into an abode that resembles Black Books or a massive Kindle shop? I know which one  I'd prefer?\n\nGod help me if one day I go in and Bernard Manny and Fran are sitting drinking red wine in the corner, swatting strange unseen creatures, while they discuss the reasons not to throw a kindle in the bin, or end the suffering of book lovers and give this place back the dignity and charm it deserves or put it out to pastures new.\n\nI did like coming here, but now as I know it's lost a few regular customers, dropped a few more books since I started writing this email and not really made many inspirational changes to keep me from going elsewhere then apologies to them.\n\nBut if your gonna subtract something then if you add something else you really should multiply to get better results. With great power comes greater responsibility so please Waterstones be even greater and more responsible!",1
"Flights we're canceled so I needed to drive 8 hours home. Upon return, there was NO ONE there ready for my return. The attendants were in their small stations and would not scan my vehicle. They told me to go to the main office counter. When I got there, the line was out the door with people waiting to make reservations! I just needed to return! The line was barely moving! It was late, I was tired and, though there were employees in the lot, not a single one would take two minutes to scan and print a receipt for one return. 45 minutes later I was able to return my vehicle. I've never had this issue with any other rental company and I will NEVER use Hertz again.",0
"Matt's Big Breakfast is AWESOME\nThe food is great, great retro-atmosphere and the staff is very attentive and friendly.  Centrally located and very easy to get to by the Light Rail or plenty of parking in the rear.",4
"Better than Smashburger. Cant get enough of their onion rings and BBQ Burger. Give it a try, you will be back for more.",4
"I agree with Amy G, this place is rubbish!!\n\nMy brothers excitedly told me to go here whenever I am on my way home from a night out because when they had been here they had met Party Boy from Jackass. Yeah ok. When I did eventually make it there, it was grotty, small and full of people just watching me. What's up with that? I was with my friend after a night out and we both ordered Chicken Pakora and were going to sit in and eat it,but upon seeing all the boxes of half-eaten food and drunks lolling around beside it, we decided against it. The food was horrible, really chewy and had no taste. We wern't impressed, and even less so when we went back another time for chips - how can you get chips wrong?! Maybe we should have tried the Pizza - it is their speciality.....but i dread to think....",0
I had an EXCELLENT experience at Sassoon!  I went it looking for a change and to thin out my hair.  I was very honest with my stylist (Jesika).  I told her I grew up with boys and do not know how to do much but do want to look good!  I told her I go to bed with it wet and wake up and go to work.  She gave me the perfect cut!  She layered the hair so it falls perfectly!  My hair looks great every day and all I do is brush it!!  Kuddos Jesika!,4
"Thanks Yelpers, for another great restaurant recommendation! The BF and I went last night and really enjoyed our dinner. First of all, the service was excellent, everyone was so kind and attentive. \n\nI've only been to Indian restaurants a handful of times and each of those times was with \""experienced\"" Indian restaurant-goers, so I was a little intimidated to be in charge of ordering (my bf has never had Indian food before). To be safe, I ordered the \""classics\"": Lamb masala, palak paneer (spinach and tofu), and daal makhni (lentils)... they were all delicious! The masala was probably our favorite. The rice and naan (we got the garlic) were both great with our saucy dishes. Bf had the Himalayan beer (nice a light) and I had the strawberry lassi. I love the sweet, yogurty tartness of it with the flavorful spiciness of the dishes. \n\nMy boyfriend also tried the \""Red Chili Pickles\"" that were advertised at the table. His order was met with raised eyebrows and an \""are you sure?\"" by our server. What we got were not even remotely close to what we know to be pickles... my best guess is maybe some type of bean curd wrapped in chili skin. It was more salty than spicy (hence the pickle name?). We asked our server what it was and he said he had no idea and had never had it before. Ha! They seemed very impressed that my bf ate the \""pickles\"". \n\nI've successfully introduced and converted my boyfriend into an Indian food lover. We'll definitely be going back!",3
"My breakfast tab alone was 75 bucks. The mimosas were 14 dollars each and teeny tiny. They need to let people know this. The food was meh. I get that its the strip, but there is a limit one can take.",1
"My review is probably going to be very unpopular as cartel coffee has turned to a cult but nevertheless...here we go.\nI had to finally try what the hype is all about and ordered a cup of cappuccino. The service and the ambiance are great and the cup of coffee looked gorgeous. The taste however was awful. The coffee was sooooo acidic (citrusy, they say) that I couldn't drink it. Bummer :(",1
"OK...let me preface this by saying I too was swayed by Adam swooning over a sandwich on Man Vs. Food...I think he nearly passed out from pleasure. \nSo, when my family and I found ourselves in downtown Pittsburgh, hungry as heck, passing this famous restaurant, I said \""OMG, there's that place with the fries on the sandwich!!\""  Wifey said 'why not' and son/man-child mumbled something incoherent about 'hungry'.\nWe were seated quickly (large wood booth...we aren't the slimmest family), since the place was mostly empty.  No menu? OHHH...it's one of those places where you just look up on the chalkboard. COOL!!\nI had the Cheesesteak, wifey had the roast beef something or other, and my son/man-child had the kid's cheeseburger. Cokes all around.  No need to order sides of fries or coleslaw, CUZ IT COMES ON THE SANDWICH!! How cool is that?  I regaled my family with my knowledge... \""they created this sandwich so truckers could eat the thing with one hand...\""  Wifey rolled her eyes and returned to her texting, and son/man-child kept playing his Nintendo 3DS.  Hmmm...maybe I'll keep my knowledge to myself for a while.  Looked around: Cool paintings/graphics on the walls, sports icons from SteelTown, USA, etc... Long counter with your typical customers doing typical things..\nFood arrives in about 15 minutes...Not bad...ready to chow down!!! Smells great!!!\nAnd...\nUmm... \na bunch of coleslaw slid out of my sandwich into my lap.  Wifey complained her fries were soggy as h*ll. \""should I send it back? are they supposed to soak up the coleslaw liquid?\""  ManChild ate his cheeseburger in about 3 bites and looked at me in anger, with that \""I told you I wanted to go to Taco Bell\"" accusatory stare...\n\nWhat can I say?  I was duped.  The sandwiches are flavorless... the fries, had they been crispy, would have been good, but they soak up the coleslaw liquid...so they are mushy.  Coleslaw has a TON of vineger, so if you don't like that style (I prefer the mayo-based) you probably won't like it.  Interesting concept, but I have no idea why this is Pittsburgh's famous sandwich.\n\nToo bad... Adam steered me right in Philly for a cheesesteak, and in Chicago for pizza, and Detroit for a coney dog, but this was a big miss. Pittsburgh needs a new 'must have.'\n\nSide note: I was not allowed to choose restaurants the rest of the trip.  Thanks Adam!!  :-P",1
"I waited for this Cotswold Smashburger a long time. It's nice knowing I can stop in, so close to home, and get a fresh-cooked burger made like I choose. It's especially needed here in the Cotswold n'hood. The burgers are nothing all that 'WOW' and I think they're quite high dollar ($7) for a burger. Fries of any kind are extra $ and the very skinny fries. I DO like their Smashfries that are tossed in rosemary/garlic/oliveoil. They have lots of other foods and ice cream shakes, too! I'm sorta limited to what I can eat, as I'm a gastric bypass survivor. They DO allow me to eat off the KidsMenu, as do so many other great CLT restaurants, which I am thankful for. Even a kids meal burger is 2 meal for me. I'm going to adventure the menu more soon! Of note is they have one of those 100+ kinds soda machines and while I am not a soda drinker, the machine also has flavored waters and a Segrams Lemon-Lime in it!\nThe Smashie workers are all polite & mostly college-aged...and appear happy at work. \nThe Take-out Bar/waiting section could/should be redone...as it's in a strange place and when the place is busy you are always in someones way. Parking is there behind the place, BUT if you visit know the in/out are ONE...and difficult to get out of behind th HTeeter. Park on the Randloph Rd side of HT for better escape once done with your Smashburger!",2
"A steakhouse in Bloomfield.  Went there on a Saturday night looking for a good burger.  It was a little crowded.  The burger was large and very tasty.  The buns need a lot of work.  There was no bread or anything beforehand and no appetizers on the menu.   No drink list either, though there is a bar.  AND no dessert menu.  I just felt like they were missing so much and don't quite agree with the high ratings on this site.  The home fries were great though.",2
"I went to the buffet here and was appalled, repelled, flabberghasted, and lots of other big words with negative conotations. I have to pay at a buffet-type restaurant AFTER I eat? I really hate that because I can just feel the surveillance dudes watching me on the 1,001 cameras to make sure I don't skip out. At a buffet, please let me pay FIRST!! I went here because I heard they had crawfish which I hadn't tasted since I was living in Louisiana when I was little. These crawfish were not kept cold enough and had a rubbery taste as they were sitting on hard unfresh ice that had melted into itself. Maybe the ice was scared of the big mean cook staring me down with a sour look on his face as he stood behind the frozen station. The clam chowder soup was like milk and the whole time I was there, the bread and cracker baskets were not refilled once! The mashed potatoes resembled cream-of-wheat and the desserts were stale and crusty. The only good thing was the adequate cost (it better be) and, surprisingly, that my servers were nice and brought me my drinks promptly. But I knew very soon that this was not a place I was ever going to visit again (even though I live in Vegas). These restaurants (or at least the immediate managers therein) have got to realize that there are too many other eateries where people can go to enjoy a meal; a person doesn't have to put up with this sort of thing - I certainly won't.",1
"This place is DISGUSTING!  So glad I went there before ordering any delivery!  Wasted $6.00 though, took a few bites of the GROSS food & threw it away!!  From the lobby ordering area the back door was opened & NUMEROUS jugs all over the back floor along with the strong smell of CLEANING SOLUTIONS!  I should have walked out then!! I ordered the lemon chicken with rice & egg roll.  The smell was not good in the to go back on the way home.  The lemon chicken is previously FROZEN & the breading was gooey in the middle!  The pour over lemon sauce was NASTY!  The rice was nasty too!  Broke open the egg roll, smelled it, threw it all away!  I should have called & asked for my money back!  The health department needs to check this place out!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!",0
Tried Welcome Diner for the first time tonight.  We did only try the Hurricanes but will definitely be back to try the biscuits. The place is very unique.  We sat outside and it was kind of like sitting in someone's backyard.  They have a walk up window if you chose to sit outside or you can sit inside at the small counter. It was happy hour all day since it was Tuesday.  Awesome!! Service as polite and quick. The Hurricanes were refreshing but not strong. Don't let the neighborhood or decor scared tour away. Can't wait to come back and try the food and other cocktails.,3
"I went here on a Saturday morning right after opening. First for the positives: it was a very clean facility, very friendly staff, and I loved that they were playing kids movies rather than shows that would not be ok for my kids to see. Negative: There was only one other person in the lobby and check in still took 10-15 minutes. Secondly I was the only patient there at the time I was called back and I sat in the room and sat there for at least 20 minutes while I heard the nurses talking instead of tending to the patient-Me! I thought it was ridiculous that they were talking about dinner plans while I sat there with a 102.5 degree fever a week after delivering my son. I had to stick my head out the door and ask if or when someone would be coming- they replied it would be just a minute. It was at least 5 more minutes while they finished their conversation. The nurse proceeded to prescribe me an antibiotic that would not be the best choice ( according to my dr two days later and the pharmacist) for my nursing newborn. I told each of the nurses at least twice each I was nursing . Also when needing a urine sample I had to go into a restroom that was also used for drug screening so the toilet was not able to flush and I couldn't use the sink to wash my hands. I had to ask to wash my hands outside the room in the testing area.\nOverall, as with any other urgent care I feel that a patient gets inadequate treatment. Every time I go to one of these places they misdiagnose me or my children. I was not happy with the speed of treatment here. As the only patient it still took me an hour and a half-- this was just for diagnosis, a flu screen, and a urine test. However, the staff was friendly and it seemed very clean. Still better than the ER for moderate health needs.",2
"Jetta and I ended up here after trying to navigate Chino Bandido and failing. I just wanted a menu with items on it - not a score card with acronyms that might as well have been arbitrarily assigned. \n\nBurrito Bandito, your menu is so straight forward a stoned college student could navigate it with ease. \n\nI ordered a veggie burrito, because I was so heat sick from driving all over Phoenix that any actually meat might have put me over the edge. I was heartbroken, Burrito Bandito, because I'd been buttered up to expect something glorious. \n\nWhat I got was a sad little excuse for a food item that tasted like an amputated normal burrito. Your veggie burrito cannot stand up on it's own, it is merely a regular burrito with the meat held off. And it tasted just like that - like something vital to the burrito was missing. The tortilla was so dry it flaked like paper. There was no cheese! What the hell is up with that? There's sour cream, but no cheese? The tomatoes tasted like they'd accidentally been sprayed with cleaning product.\n\nBurrito Bandito, I want to love you. I want to tell stories about you back home in San Francisco. But I felt you were punishing me for going meatless! I'm not a vegetarian, BB, I'm just a little car sick from the 110\u00ba weather! Please, do not criticize me via the food. \n\nI'll give you this, BB. Your Baby Banditos, all smothered in jalape\u00f1o cream cheese, go down mighty easy. Crunchy and chewy and cheesy and spicy. Take that, Taco Bell. BOOM-shaka-laka.",2
"You have to have some set of balls to have the word \""spice\"" in your name and put out food as bland as this place does! It's like it all came out of the same buffet leftover tupperware. Worst chinese food I have ever had. Service was just average at best. When I can say Panda Express is way better than this place (and that's not saying anything), I suggest you eat ANYWHERE else.",0
"My husband and I have attempted to eat at Rib Cage on three different occasions, twice they were closed and the last time we went I called before hand to see what time they were open until and was told 9:00. We were so excited to finally be trying this place and when we got there they told us that they were out of food and that all they had was white meat chicken and only enough for 1 person. The guy then checked in the kitchen and told us there would be enough for two people. By this point we were halfway out the door. It was 7pm and they were completely out of food! UNACCEPTABLE! Unfortunately we will not be going back again. Too bad, it smelled really good.  : (",0
"Forget about the apathetic reviews... this place is awesome!\n\nAll you can eat sushi?  Check!  All you can eat yellowfin tuna/ Ahi? Double-check!  All you can eat snow crab legs, shrimp, and crawfish?  All you can eat melt-in-your-mouth Korean beef short ribs and more? You get the point! (Please note that crab legs and ahi are only served on Sundays.)\n\nCome here hungry, and you'll most likely get the bang for your buck!  Unlike most Oriental-American buffets, this one keeps their stuff hot & fresh and they also have Mexican food and a decent section of deserts.  The service is good but not superb and some of the items are mediocre. \n\nSo, yes... overall, I'm a happy customer and I think that you'll concur!!!",4
"I really like Lenny's.  They're such a nice escape from all the other chain sub restaurants, ESPECIALLY Subway, which I'm growing to detest.  This one recently went thru an ownership change but the staff is just as friendly as the original, so no worries there (or w/the quality of food).\n\nWhen you first order a \""regular\"" sub & see the bread they whip out you think, \""wow, that's nothing special\"" (in comparison to other places)...but that's before they start PILING on the meat and toppings!  The good folks at Lenny's do NOT skimp on those.  That underwhelming bread loaf very quickly becomes a heaping mass of goodness that will quench most any appetite.  I took my dad here once & he scoffed at the beginnings of his 'samich until he saw the finished product...and could barely finish it (and he can pack away some food!).  \n\nJust came home with a regular turkey on wheat (and they have excellent wheat bread btw), and it was only $6.94 w/tax.  For only about $1.50 or $2 more you can make it a meal - but I'm TRYING to be healthy so I opted for water at home (insert grimace here cuz they have really good sweet tea). Basically the same thing you'd pay at Subway for miniscule toppings on a 6\"" sandwich. \n\nLenny's reg sub is 7.5\"" and twice the size of Subway toppings-wise, and their large is twice that at FIFTEEN inches!  They also have a good selection of salads, as well as hot subs like Philly Cheesesteaks.  Oh, and they also have these \""grilled footlong hot dogs,\"" BUT BEWARE - they aren't your ordinary hot dogs, they're more like these ENORMOUS sausages & they're rather oily/greasy...not for the faint of heart (and the reason they're like five/six bucks or something like that).  \n\nSo, in short, if you're in the area of this or any of the other Lenny's, give'em a shot - you're sure to be in for a treat.  And you'll certainly be full when you leave!",4
Look At this spendy lamp I got from there that broke the third day. And am dissappointed that they wouldn't let be exchange.   Not good customer service here.,0
"The Spoke and Wheel has become my new neighborhood hangout. They offer a great happy hour with $5 cocktails, wines and beers and pretty tasty eats. A few of my favorites are the Breakdancer drink and the grilled jalapenos wrapped in bacon (everything is better wrapped in bacon). I brought my grandmother here for lunch and she raved over her chicken sandwich. I had a burger and it well done (as I requested) and the avocado was fresh and creamy.\n\nThey have an enormous patio and the service has always been great, they remember my name and drink and are always friendly and fun to chat with .\n\nIf you ride your bike (as we often do) they give you happy hour prices all day. Way to support the locals!",3
"Went here for the first time a couple nights ago, I was part of a group of 6 and we were seated promptly, which was nice but the rest of the experience was pretty poor. Very young looking waitress came to our table to get drink orders, my friend asked about details of a couple of the beers, then ordered ONE of them. When the tween returned with our drinks, she brought my friend 2 beers....hmmm weird. When we informed her that there was only one beer ordered, and that we didn't want it she said we should try it and just see if we like it. Ok, I'm a fan of beer. That shit was gross, I don't remember what beer, but seriously GROSS!!!!! The tween then has the nerve to tell me that she likes the beer because she's a fan of wheat beers and that since we had said we like wheat beers, we should like that too. If by \""wheat beer\"" she meant that she likes fruity piss water, than great but that was no wheat beer. Either way, I left early and paid for my appetizer (crab, spinach dip that was mediocre) and my friend was later charged for that extra shitty beer. I won't be returning to this place, their other drinks were fine but the service was horrible and the food wasn't any good either.  I'd rather have a beer at the Yardhouse than deal with the incompetent tweens that work as waitstaff here.",0
"Absinthe is a great 90 minute show.  The acts are quite dazzling and daring--strong men doing amazing lifts and balancing, a roller skating couple, aerial act, and much more.  Think V Variety Theatre meets Zumantiy, with a zany MC, the Gazillionaire, and his peppy sidekick, Penny.\n\nWhen I entered the beer garden area, open to the public, I was intrigued by the decor or lack thereof.  Bathtubs made into seats, assorted lights and letters to spell the name of the beer garden, whimsical lights--it has a little of everything.\n\nIf you know someone who can get you a VIP ticket, take it.  I was VIP last night.  You get to enter a private lounge.  Access is through a green telephone booth.  Once you show your ticket, you step into the booth, pick up the phone, and when someone on the other side picks up, say anything you want.  He'll let you into the VIP area.  There's another bar in there and you get 1 free drink ticket with the VIP seating.  I had a great time chatting with people from out of town.  And, it's a relaxing area decorated in an eccentric manner a bit muted compared to the outside garden.\n\nVIP ticket holders are allowed into the circular building first, so this guarantees you the seat of your choice.  I took a front row seat, and it was great.  Being the 3rd person in the theatre has its perks.  I was also \""picked on\"" by the Gazzilionaire a bit.  All in good fun and for lots of laughs--no lap dance from Penny.\n\nThe acts are dazzling.  The performers are very talented.  The show is almost exactly 90 minutes.  The seats are wood, so they begin to feel uncomfortable after awhile.  They are also hooked together with lock ties so you can't get a bit more room from your neighbor.  This is because the stage is relatively small and the performers are coming in and out through small aisles.\n\nI highly recommend this show.  What an addition to the lineup of shows in Las Vegas.  At $69 before taxes and fees, this show is less expensive than many on the Strip.  Go and enjoy!",4
"Just walked in the see how much it was to get done and the young lady was rude about the whole thing no hi hello how are you how can I help you just what can I get you really I didn't care about the price cause my feet hurt but she made me just say forget it and do it myself, don't go here!!!",0
Definitely not bad; not really good either. It's nice that the garlic knots are complementary and pretty good. Nice discounts offered. Will not be back.,2
"MAN! this place has suuuuuuuuuuuccchhhh a good location, good name and all. but the food is notttttttttttttttt that good! \n\ni know this place gets alot of business b/c of the location, but please people... venture out and read yelp!!!!!! cathay house is much much much much better than this place. its just a little bit down the street on the right hand side and about the same price.\n\nI will only come here if i am meeting friends here and suggesting another place is out of the question.\n\nhavnt had dim sum here, but my close friend didnt like this place very much either.\n\nI had dinner here... the food was ok, but i've had better.",1
"On my way to Kingman, I dropped by to get a breakfast burrito. Now when the wife and I go to Cali early in the morning, Our ritual is to pick up a breakfast burrito on the way out. I usually order the steak and egg burrito while my wife always order their country burrito. Their country burrito consist of potato's, eggs, and cheese. Well I decided to order the country burrito with a twist. I asked them to add chili verde. They were more then happy to do that for me.\nFiliberto's is conveniently located in the same building with the Shell mini-mart. So you can go next door and get what you need and come back for your food. \nEverything was easy and convient, got in and got out very quickly. And the Burrito? It was great!!",3
"I love this place.  Not only do the have great sushi at reasonable prices, they have $1 hot sake! $2 for a big bottle. The staff is very friendly and always offers great service. It gets a little crowded so feel free to call for reservations. Also, one of the best all you can eat deals in town.",4
"Been going there for few times now...... the last three weeks it has been Blah ! Muffins are to dry ,I bought Blueberry , Mandarin and Cinnamon walnut Muffin and all of them so dry they crumble . Ask for a hot latte and the machine is broken I mean both machines .. so the third try they come up with we do only cold latte ... and it clearly say's now serving Hot latte's ...yeah right. Most of the food looks like I can make it at home and kinda pricey for easy food you can make....  Im out not going back, no more Paradise for me, going down hill guys.... Oh by the way , I went to STARBUCKS for a Hot Latte, why did I even bother to ask in Paradise ...  See ya !",1
"I had higher hopes for this place. Sigh. But nonetheless, it was pretty good and the ambiance was stellar. So romantic and French!! We sat at a window and got to experience the Bellagio fountains. We had the fancy smanshy drinks... I had a Scarlet Letter... meh. $13 and it shoulda been better...and BIGGER. The gf had some martini that tasted of malibu. Double meh. However... apps were to die for!  French onion soup and the scallops gratin... you two little lovlies saved the night!! Amazing. Also the bread and the pickled fennel/whatever... awesome. I have to figure out how to make the pickled veggies. All four of us got steak entrees... meh. I am not a fan of the classic steak frite... the frites.. yes.. pretty yummy... the steak.. ok maybe I'm just a Texan and like REAL steaks!! They can keep the paper thin steak with funky tasting butter. Yuk. The hanger steak the gf got was super tiny and tasted like barbecue. Can't remember what the others got but no one was impressed. Creme brulee.. eh, had better at chain restaurants. The apps and the atmosphere make up for the mediocre entrees. Service was great... super cool waiter. I'd try it again. Maybe.",2
"Can't beat the beet symphony!  That's what my bf got while I had the chocolate one.  SO yummy!  The squab was okay, kinda heavy with foie gras stuffed inside.  The service was impeccable, except for the 12 year-old-lookin bread boy who came to our table practically beggin us to take some bread.  \""Please sir...take my baguette!\""",3
"JUST GO GIVE IT A CHANCE. MAKE A DECISION BASED ON WHAT YOU SEE YOURSELF.  \nI've been a member of many gyms, and this one is by far my favorite. I snubbed my nose at it because of the ratings and low price. (I'm used to paying $50+ for all my other memberships.) I didn't like LA Fitness or Anytime fitness when I toured their facilities. I gave this gym a chance as a very last resort and I'm so glad I did. They validate the parking so I can go hang out, AMAZING staff, clean, everything is up to date. I really feel spoiled by this gym.",4
Our waiter talked too much: he Blah-Blah-Blahed about the trip he took with his mom in France.  Lamb I ordered was not gamey/flavorful enough.  Not worth $$$$.  I will not go back.,1
Love this place! Its a little hard to find but so worth it. Plenty of wine to choose from. Amazing chopped salad and fondu.,4
"One of the worst things about Yelp is that there are no options for Zero stars for restaurant's that truly deserve it. That statement is only for this location and not for the Cafe Rio chain as the others I have been to have all been wonderful, but the management at this location is truly horrendous. If you want a better experience go to the one next to Sportsman's Warehouse and you will see what this chain really stands for. The store on Decatur is a easy fix, just bring in a manager that actually knows how to run a restaurant and isn't insulting to customers. The manager is truly a piece of work and really need to be retrained. I have been in sales and traveled the western US for the past 40 years and I have never come into contact with worst customer service, this guy really takes the cake.",0
"run by thugs, and skanky strippers that are too old and burnt out to show that much skin.\nWas literally robbed by this staff. and threatened. Sure wish I read through these bad yelp reviews,... looks pretty common here",0
"I made a yelp account just so I can give this place a one star. I had a groupon so I came here with my sister. We first waited at the front door for a minute while they were talking in the backroom. I even said/yelled a hello nd I had to finally go to the bar area and then when this asain waitress saw me she came out. After being seated we got some menus, nd as it was my second time giving this place a chance AGAIN they did not have half the menu. the drinkS ( plural )  nope. Asked for less ice and the reply was you will get it in a smaller glass then, the burger i wanted nope, oh even the chips and salsa that are suppose to come with the food they didnt have. Apparently they were serving fruit with a BURGER today. Hmmm one strawberry nd pickle literally half the size of my pinky. Nice excuse of being out of that also, not substituted with fries which is an extra cost with the burger but one strawberry, are you not suppose to put the customer first. Then my sisters food came with a hair in it nd we told our server nd of course the server compares the hair size to my sisters. Are u kidding me. After the food we presented the groupon to the asain waitress who looks at my sister like we stole the phone nd asks for id. I would give it no stars if I had an option. That lady is straight out rude, i think she owned the place because she was on her phone and laptop the whole time  in a corner, no service what so ever. NEVER AGAIN WILL I COME TO THIS PLACE. I WOULD RECOMMEND AGAINST IT IN EVERY WAY. The food ( Cajun Burger ) had no flavor to it at all. There was bland meat and one portion somewhat in the middle that tasted somewhat cajun but thats it...",0
"I had lunch here with Local First Arizona today. I didn't get a good look at the decor but I enjoyed the laid back atmosphere. The servers were prompt and attentive - they were at the table immediately upon my arrival and ready to get me a drink.\n\nEveryone at my table seemed to enjoy their food - mostly salads and pizza. I had the nachos since it was nacho day. I appreciated the generous portion and the fact that they modified it as I requested even with our big group. I was disappointed that all the cheese and toppings were on top of the pile of chips. The pile was big enough that they could have put half the chips on the plate, added toppings and then repeated the process. After I ate the top layer, all I had was warm plain chips underneath. \n\nThis isn't a place I'll likely seek out, but it's the type of place I'd go to if I was in the neighborhood.",2
"Eat in or take out, can't go wrong. Ribs vs. Q is an epic gastronomic battle for the ages. Be Switzerland and get both. Great hush puppies, green beans and potato salad.",2
"Craving some chips, salsa, and a burrito, a small group of us sauntered into Pasqual's earlier this week.  We were immediately seated (in the bar area), and placed an order for some brews.\n\nTwo of the brews were unavailable - they had sold out.  Substitutions were made and chips with queso were ordered.\n\nI'm familiar with many styles of queso... but I was shocked by Pasqual's \""queso\"" - it was more like a soft-spread, cream-cheese-infused queso-wannabe.  Rather than a soft, flowing, warm queso, this was cold and hard-packed in a small Solo cup.  Definitely unusual, and largely tasteless.  Two salsas accompanied the \""queso\"" - neither were exceptional.\n\nDinner orders were placed: taco plate, a chicken fajita burrito, and a veggie burger (don't ask).\n\nThe food arrived fairly quickly, and portions were impressive if nothing else.  My burrito was stuffed full of black beans, grilled chicken, and a few veggies.  A massive serving of black beans (not refried - yay!) filled-out the rest of the plate.  The burrito was decent, but again - bland and not remarkable by any means.\n\nThe taco plate was covered in shredded lettuce and cheese; I'm told it was \""ok.\""  I won't even comment on the veggie burger because in the end, they're all about the same... frozen-pressed Bocas taste the same no matter which microwave they came from.\n\nThe bill arrived; my meal with a few rounds of brews and paying for the chips and salsa was a staggering $36... a little steep given the unexciting nature.\n\nInterior was large, open, and quite noisy.  They do have a great selection of Tequila - I'd like to sample a few at some future time.\n\nPasqual's = MEH\n\nFood = 2.25 stars\nValue = 2 stars\nService = 3.5 stars (good waiter; attentive and helpful)\nMISC = 2.25 stars",1
"Not a fan of this location.  Try the one on 3rd ave & south side of bell.\n\nWow, someone actually managed to ruin a Starbucks location!!  Slow drive through, condescending service, and overall lack of interest on the part of the employees. \n\nWe stopped in on my hunny's birthday on our way to vegas. This is the location closest to us so we wanted to just get in and out.  The voice on the drive through was kinda short with us, but I get it- you're busy.  We finally get to the window after over 10 minutes waiting.  The guy does not give us our gift card back.  I go inside and they can't find it. My hunny goes inside, and at least gets them to look for it and reprint the receipt.  Starbucks corporate reissued the card for us a few days later so in ended up fine.  \n\nStill, this location has no urgency!!",1
Decided to stop her with some friends for happy hour after doing some gambling. They have 99 cent margaritas & 99 cent tacos. That night the tacos were chicken. I guess they change daily. The drinks were pretty good & seriously..who can complain about a drink that costs 99 cents at the Hard Rock?\nThe tacos were also pretty good. Fresh shredded chicken on a small tortilla. A couple of them & I was ready for the evening of drinking. They have some amazing eye candy at the Hard Rock so its always fun to eat anywhere on the property.\nI cant wait to bring my friends here on our girls weekend away this weekend..,3
"Very nice server, but the food was just ok and I would not go back. I had the beer brat and my girlfriend got the Cheesy Dream Burger. The brat wasn't very good and the bun was too big for it. The burger was better, but nothing great. The cheese dipping sauce was a let down. Also, the pretzel mozzarella with tomato sauce was also just ok at best. \n\nIt's a decent place to watch a game though, at least for how it's set up.",1
"Went to honey salt for brunch on Sunday @ 130.  Hostess was very accommodating and sat us promptly.  The server assistant asked for our water order which was delivered.  It took about 10 minutes for our waiter to finally come over  and asked us if we were ready to order.  The waiter did not recommend any food or drinks.  It seems to me they might have too many tables to tend to @ one time.  \n \nI ordered the New England fry, which was good, but it was missing the shishito peppers that were described on the menu.  I understand it's a farm to table restaurant, but the servers need to inform the guests of changes in the menu.  This might have been a kitchen to server miscommunication. Who knows?\n\nThe food has been fantastic on both of my visits. Service is an issue.  I don't want to wait 10 minutes for our server to receive our drinks right before our food arrives.I drive 25 minutes to get there for a 45 to 115 hr dining experience for terrible service.  \n\nI would be back for the food, but not the service.  I will miss the culinary adventure.  Good luck!",1
"This place serves the worst ribs I have ever had in my life.  I complained twice to the waitress about how bad the ribs were, but she didn't do anything about it.  DO NOT EAT HERE.",0
Vegas baby Vegas! Been coming to vegas for years. I still love all the lights and the glow of Vegas night life. They are constantly changing things and its only getting better as the years pass ...,4
"Trader Joe's has always struck me as the supermarket for people who don't like to cook. The amount of prepared, packaged, frozen and ready to eat items far outweighs the fresh here. The produce section here is as underwhelming as at any other Trader Joe's I've shopped, and none of it is local or organic. Plus, this location doesn't even offer the cheap booze and house label wines you can find at TJ's outside the state of Pennsylvania. I think people enjoy the novelty here, as you will find a few things under the Trader Joe's label that are good quality...I just don't think they're better quality than you can find at the Market District down the street. Once upon a time this market was interesting and definitely filled a niche, back when all supermarkets offered the same boring stuff. But times have changed, and I don't see much special about TJ's anymore. If you want a fun market head south on Route 19 just a block and check out the Uncommon Market...that place rocks. Hmmm...I feel another review coming on....",1
"Best breakfast burritos hands down as well as tasty salsa to eat it with. I enjoy the egg, cheese, tomato, and union which you can substitute the flour tortilla for wheat.",4

"One of the best airport restaurants anywhere.  You'll get top-quality food and fast service here, unlike most in-airport restaurants.\n\nThe menu has a decent variety from simple to high end.  There are some neat sandwich options like the ham with Gruyere and some other unexpected ingredients (forgot them all now).  If you're keeping it light there are several very good salad options.\n\nPrice...well it's upscale food at an airport, so it's not cheap, but I didn't feel it was out of line either.",3
"Decent sushi. My sodas tasted  gross to carbonated or something. The sushi was decent for the price, the Korean food is great.",2
"Slow, slow, slow.  Place was a ghost town.  Service was poor, facilities seemed in need of maintenance and repair.  I wonder how long until the Lake Las Vegas hotels change brands again or just shut down altogether.  The golf course looked like they were just letting return to desert.",1
"Okay maybe out east our fake beef is tastier or something but this was hands down the worst Taco Bell I've ever had. \n\nFirst off, they messed up our order but being hungry and having a grumpy toddler yelling in our ears, we didn't bother to correct it. \n\nSecond, the steak in the chalupas my husband ordered was extremely bland and the chalupa bread was bitter like it was old or fried in bad oil or whatever they do to that. The \""beef\"" in my soft taco was the right color and consistency but was also flavorless. Stranger still was the normally soft tortilla wrap was crispy on the edges but soaked through everywhere else. How long had it been sitting there anyways? \n\nHmmm, hoping that not ALL the Taco Bells in Arizona suck. But thankfully with all the Mexican food around, it shouldn't be hard to find decent tacos elsewhere.",0
"The last time I saw the Blue Man Group was many years ago, back when they were at the Luxor.  This was my first Vegas show experience and I was very impressed.  I figured that 8-9 years later the show would change quite a bit, but much of the content was very similar to before.  \n\nThere were some entertaining and funny parts, but there were also some parts that were pretty boring and I found myself getting sleepy.  The \""paper\"" finale didn't seem to have as much \""wow\"" factor from the first time I saw it...seemed like we had a lower volume of paper this time, or maybe it was because I was seated at the middle of the theatre last time and this time I was on the side.  A few of the lit streamers that dangled from the ceiling malfunctioned too so we didn't get the full effect of that.\n\nIt was a good thing though that I was with the girls, so at least I had great company.  It was a better thing that we saw 2 shows that night...I've also seen \""Phantom\"" before, but it was much more entertaining than this show.",2
"Friends tell me this place is great, but my experience was only so-so. I went for a weekend breakfast a little while back, and wasn't all that excited about the service. The place was pretty crowded, which is ok, but the waiters did little to take care of this--it took forever for us to order, and even longer to get our good. AND though I ordered poached eggs with crab cakes, the dish came out without the eggs--which is pretty bad. The food was, however, pretty darn tasty, and with huge portions, which is how I like it. \n\nThere's nice outdoor patio (not that that matters in this weather) which is great when it's warm. It was very packed, though, so prepare to wait if you want to sit outside. Apparently it's a fun place to go to at night, too, but I can't speak to that...yet.",1
We had dinner last night and I need to confirm that this venue still suffers with a lack of good service and appears to have a revolving door of managers which have little concern for patrons.\n\nThe once small chain which was the very best has lost it's vision!,0
"They won't seat you until your entire party is there.  Why?  Who cares?  You are holding the table.  Put people in it and get them started.  This is some antient rule started back in the day and no restaurant knows why they do it.  If the rest of the party takes too long, then those sitting can get started.  Get a clue.  If people are comfortable, they will spend money to eat and drink.  STUPIDITY!  The food is fabulous.  The waiter chose our courses and they were all great.  The bar area is weak with poor service.  And, they make you close out your tab before you sit to eat dinner.  Hello.  Make it easy for your customers to spend money not difficult.  I can't complain about the food.  The drinks are overpriced.  Our meal for two cost about $180.",2
"Food was great however service was super slow. I asked for lemon for my water and seafood as soon as I placed the order. It didn't come until after I was done with my seafood starter and my water glass was half empty. My drink also came after my food arrived. Even though I asked for it after I placed my food order, server should have coordinated it to assure it got here before.",2
"They didn't have the one beer I was looking for (Pumpking). \nI was told if I write a review solely based on that... I'm \""that yelper.\""\nSo in addition to them not having the beer that I went there for, they also serve sauce-less wings in this sort of DIY format that is nowhere near getting a thoroughly dredged and sauced up wing that leaves you wishing you had more napkins. I'll try 'em out again and explore more of the menu and hope they have Pumpking next time on draft.",2
"Okay, so like everyone else says this place is a little hard to find but trust me, it is worth it!! \n\nSo we're sitting in our hotel starving and looking for something close by and I stumble on this place. After reading the reviews and seeing the pictures I pick to come here. I followed the directions that another yelper left and walked right to it. \n\nWe decided to order the Devils eggs, bacon jam, gyro tacos and the baked mac and cheese. I cannot say enough about them! This place is truly without a doubt the hidden jem of Vegas! \n\nI was hesitant about the Devils eggs because neither my husband or I have had caviar before, but oh my if we wouldn't hVe order so much other food we would have gotten another order! The amount of salt from the pancetta and the caviar was just the right touch. \n\nWe were also scared of the bacon jam, I mean come on, it sounds odd right? We broke down and got it anyways after talking to the waitress and I don't even know how to describe it but it was the most breath taking thing I've eating in Vegas! \n\nCome find this place! You won't regret it!!",4
"Great museum that uses all sorts of displays  and technology to communicate the fascinating history of atomic bomb testing. The only blot was the $6 extra to tour the poorly done Site 51 area. That was done at the level of a Halloween haunted house in someone's basement. Don't pay extra for that, the museum really should just throw it in for free.",4
"This was my first time staying at the Mirage.  I have stayed at A LOT of hotels in Vegas. This hotel is pretty good. It's not the Wynn or Palazzo, but my room was nice, updated and comfortable. \n    The casino is good, never saw table minimums below $10. You can find a good number of 25 cent slots which I like.\n     I did not find the restaurants very appealing and there is no good breakfast place. They have a buffet, I didn't try it. Instead we walked across the street to the grand lux at the Palazzo. We picked up a sandwich at the deli place. I'm gonna give it 1 star. $18 and it was only turkey and bread, that's it... Not cool.\n    The pool is good. I like the water fall, it's a great place to stay cool. You can get big $20 slushy drinks with hardly any booze at the dolphin bar. It's shady though with 3 big flat screens if you want to see a game.\n    Let's see. No real shopping, unless it's something you forgot. Good thing is the Caesar shops is right next door.  All in all I would say its a great hotel for families and people on a budget.",2
"I go to the movies an average of 5 times per week (yes, you read that correctly) but this theater makes my blood boil. I only go here to see a movie as a last resort. I don't know if it's because of the location and all those Summerlin elitists think they are more important than the rest of us, but this theater has the worst problem with talking and audience behavior than anywhere else I have ever seen a movie. Is everybody at Red Rock drinking rude juice? \n\nI have never seen a film here where the audience didn't yap the entire way through it -- and I have even been in the theater when there were only 2 other people in there and damn if they didn't talk the whole time too! I've reported this to the manager SEVERAL times. The response I always get is the same: \""I understand.\"" That's it! Well if you UNDERSTAND, then DO SOMETHING ABOUT IT! Kick the people out! Help save our sanity! No, I don't want a refund or a free ticket, I want to be able to see a movie IN PEACE AND QUIET with an audience that isn't full of rude, crude and socially unacceptable people!!!!!!!!\n\nI've politely voiced my concern with three different managers at the theater, over a dozen employees, and even with Regal Cinemas corporate headquarters. I've had the manager personally call me on the phone twice. That's nice, but still nothing has been done to address the behavior. It is rampant at this theater and it is the worst. \n\nI've had people carry on full-volume conversations, answer their cell phones, make phone calls, repeat nearly every line in the movie, refuse to take their screaming infants out to the lobby, and have their 2 year old toddlers RUN AROUND and hit the back of seats during an R-rated movie. Yep, twice! I have gotten up during the movie, left the auditorium and gone out to alert an employee. Why should I have to be punished and made to leave the film to go get somebody to help enforce audience behavior? Each time the employees haven't given a crap about it. On that note, why the hell are small children even ALLOWED in an R-rated movie, EVER?!? What's next, little Billy gets his eyes full at \""Blue Is The Warmest Color?\""\n\nI refuse to go here ever again. This last time was the last straw. My blood pressure just went up 30 points from writing this review because it makes me so angry to think about this theater. AVOID at all costs.",0

I get it anytime I can as I love this place too much.\n\nThe menu is simple, yet fresh, affordable, and oh so good.  This location is particular was extremely busy when I visited, but the staff was friendly and quick to keep the line moving and customers happy.  My parents and I ordered the cheeseburger and fries combo.  Personally, I make my burger and fries animal style, so do yourself a favor and do the same. :)\n\nYeah, it's not the BEST burger I've ever had, but for the quality and price, you can't beat this place.",4
"I had some friends in town from Chicago and they really wanted to find a bar to watch a Bears game. So we headed to Fox & Hound to check it out. My friend quickly dubbed the bar a \""Football Model UN\"" because of the variety of football fans there. Fox & Hound probably had 10 games going in different areas of the bar, and being such a newcomer cite, there were fans from all over. I can't speak much to the food, but if you're looking for a place to drink and watch football, it seems like a good spot to hit up.",2
"Thanksgiving weekend...\nSo my \""beef\"" lies with this location's staff...my wife and I were walking close to the location when a fragrance in the area attracted us...there were only (2) stores that could supply this scent...so we gambled on the 1st store...Michael Kors.  We asked the sales ladies if the fragrance that we smelled all the way out in the mall came from the store...it did.  Long story short...I had asked the sales person to \""write down\"" the name / bottle...so I could buy it away from my wife (Xmas gift)...the sales person started to look for a business card or something to write it down but quickly changed her mind and said that I could remember \""signature.\""  Well it's true that I remembered the name but the problem is that I've been looking everywhere (online) for Michael Kors \""signature\""...NO LUCK! It was as if if I didn't buy the product there at that very store...that I wasn't going to get it anywhere else...total product cock block!",0
"Castle Sports Club is the greatest bait and switch I have ever witnessed; you see the ramparts and drawbridge and you think \""castles are good. Surely there must be some of ye olde good times to be had\"", but alas, there is little awesome to be had here. \n\nNo knights or dragons. Just an inline skating rink on its last legs, a snack bar at least fifteen years out of date and ever-permeating smell of dirty socks and failure.\n\nSomewhere in the Phoenix area there must be a dilapidated old fitness center with a dungeon and a silly-looking man with a goblet screaming \""I SAID MORE WINE!\"" instead of any exercise equipment.\n\nI only ever went to Castle Sports Club for the Roller Derby league. I love roller derby. So much that the first thing I'm going to do after I'm medically declared a woman is to form a roller derby team. \n\nI'd call it Princess Squad Battel! (intentionally misspelled) with an uber-Japanese logo.\n\nOh, I'm sorry, were you reading this for factual content? \n\nCSC taints every event held inside of it with an aura of fail and apathy.\n\nThat's right. It's Michael Bay in building form.\n\nThe ceiling leaks whenever it rains, the A/C is MC Hammer (get it? Broke? Fuck you, I know I'm funny), and the floor looks like it hasn't been cleaned or repaired since it was laid down.\n\nThe league fees are so expensive that you keep looking around the building to see where the money went. Do they actually pay the referees? Are the toilets made of gold? \n\nWell, are they? I'm being serious here, I didn't go in them. I almost did, but this three hundred pound guy with a coffee stain down his shirt stepped out with this feeling of accomplishment on his face and I thought \""hey, I got that empty 7-11 cup in my car...\""\n\nIt's only a matter of time before Castle Sports will be hosting dog fights and illegal steel cage matches. Which might in fact be a step up for them. \n\nIt's a shame, though. All this potential fun to be had wasted on such a crappy venue. Makes you wish there was somewhere else to go.\n\nFuck it. Nobody goes to Rollero anymore, right?",2

"We ate the bar in front of the restaurant - they had some games on and it's just better for socializing.\n\nHad really tasty Sin City Ambers to start with.  We ordered their \""famous\"" guacamole to start with.  It was great - creamy and flavorful.  I thought the rest of the meal was good, standard fare, but the guac would bring me back again.",3
"This place is boring and tries way too hard.  The menu is limited. I had the \""pigstrami\"" sandwich. It was ok, not great. I ordered the side salad but the brought me fries.

"Koji has Chinese food (we didn't take a chance on the sushi) on par with the better restaurants in Chinatown in Honolulu and far superior to the Chinese restaurants on Maui.\n\nMy parents (who are from Maui) and I (from Oahu) ordered the gai lan, aka Chinese broccoli, my favorite Chinese vegetable; the spicy eggplant, one of my \""must have\"" dishes at any Chinese restaurant; the Mongolian beef, a concession to my less than adventurous parents; and half a crispy deep fried chicken, again a \""safe\"" choice for my parents' taste. All dishes were scrumptious, though perhaps unnecessarily laced with MSG (?). The gai lan was cooked expertly, to the point of being al dente, if I can use that term to refer to a vegetable rather than a pasta. (As an aside, note that gai lan is NOT the same vegetable as choi sum, as some would think. Just check on line or verify this with your friendly neighborhood Chinese restaurant.) The spicy eggplant, Szechuan-style, had just the right amount of \""heat.\"" The Mongolian beef was surprisingly tender. And the chicken was top notch -- the skin was crispy but not oily, and the meat was succulent and not dry.\n\nThe waiter was most attentive and informative. He also tolerated some playful ribbing from my father, all in good humor and spirit.\n\nThe price was very reasonable, as with most Chinese restaurants. I agree with some other reviewers that the ambiance needs improvement. Overall, however, this is an excellent Chinese restaurant in a most unexpected location -- tucked in the corner of the Orleans casino.",3
"We have been here a few times now, and when we feel like taking the drive down here, we prefer it to In-N-Out most times. The only thing they don't have that we miss is chocolate shakes. I would love to dunk the fries here into a chocolate shake. \n\nThey offer a \""veggie burger\"" that is basically all of their condiments on a bun. You can add cheese if you like as well. I think its pretty good and its a nice break from the basic veggie patties you see at most places. They have the best fries here. We like the cajun style the best, and the regular size is plenty for two people. They basically fill up one cup full of fries and put it in the bag, and then dump another full cup in the bag. So you are getting two cups of fries. We never finish them. They are made to order so they are always piping hot. Friendly staff and you can munch on some peanuts before your food comes out. \n\nFor two veggie burgers, fries, and two drinks we can get out of here at less than $15. Regular burgers and hot dogs end up costing more so if you are an omnivore it could get a little pricy. But for us vegetarians its a darn good deal.",3
"I'm not as liberal with my 5-star ratings as I used to be....but my recent trip to NC and a shopping outing with my BFF put a dent in my 3 to 4-star run.\n\nLet me start by saying, I HATE SHOPPING!  Its just not my thing, but this was one of those rare occasions where all went well and I landed some great purchases.  Almost 2 years ago I broke my little toe, no biggie you think, well not so in this case - I have not been able to go out and buy \""pretty\"" shoes in a long time because nothing fits right anymore.  My day in Dillard's landed me in the shoe section and to my amazement I found 3 pair of shoes that were so cute and they FIT!!  Needless to say the bonus was all were on sale, and to top it off they shipped them to me for $9!  \n\nThe customer service was excellent, except this one guy in the shoe section - he couldn't be bothered with our questions since someone else was in the back retrieving shoes we wanted to try on...oh well, not perfection on that part, but I'm certainly coming back when I'm in the area next time!",4
"Usually the only time I ever come here is if I'm waiting for friends to arrive to watch movies and I decide to grab a drink and appetizers or during happy hour.\n\nFood: The foods alright, yard house isn't really known for their food mostly for their wide range of beers. I've never eaten and entree but this place is pretty pricey. I usually grab a snack like Shrimp Ceviche or chips salsa and guacamole.\n\nDrinks/Beer: Yard house is known for its alcohol, I've never tried one of their specialty drinks but I'm not much of a mixed drink girl. BUT the BEER oh the beer, wow they have a lot to choose from every time I go I try to get something different. They even have yard house craft beers. \n\nCustomer Service: The service was nice our waitress was sweet but the place was kind of rowdy. Even for afternoons or evenings, so if your planning to have a romantic dinner don't go here. \n\nHappy Hour: The happy hour here is pretty decent, its from Monday - Friday 3pm - 6pm Sunday - Wednesday 10pm - Close half off pizza's and appetizers are the best part and the drinks",2

"This was the first hotel I have ever stayed at while visiting the Las Vegas Strip. I was very impressed by my choice of hotel!! We booked a Madison Ave Deluxe room and it looked big! The view was 'ehh' considering they gave us our room on the 4th floor but hey, its Vegas right?? I came to enjoy the ambience of the Strip, not to stay in a room all cooped up all weekend!! The staff was very friendly here. We ate at their buffet, which was at the Chin Chin restaurant. It was very affordable at only $14 a person! Other buffets were going for above $30. Heck no Im not paying that amount!! Their breakfast at the buffet was very delicious. Its cool that their hash browns are little and triangular in size!! I hadn't seen those since high school!! The casino area was pretty big, which also reeked of cigarettes, which also didn't bother me! We checked out Gonzalez y Gonzalez restaurant and club in the night time. It was a small place but with a good ambience. The music was great-Spanish music, the best kind to dance to!! Especially if you wanna see some ladies shake it!!! Since it was only a one night thing, we didn't get much of a chance to see the rest of the hotel. We did venture around it for a little bit on the day of our departure. Its cool how outside of Coyote Ugly, they have a little machine that lets you take free pix. The significant other fell in love with that and was hooked instantly! Women are such shutterbugs!! Yeah, this hotel isn't one of the new ones like Cosmopolitan, Wynn, or The Bellagio, but this hotel is very cozy and very affordable in price. Oh yeah, Gonzalez Y Gonzalez has no cover charge; just a little donation in the entrance is recommended. I would definitely recommend this hotel to anybody who is looking for a great hotel at a very affordable price. For only $20 extra at the time of booking, you can have your room ready by 10:00am. That's what we did and I must say, it worked out to our advantage! The pool was okay. Honestly, I saw much better looking pools with a greater ambience at other hotels we were checking out. I'd still give this hotel a very high recommendation to anybody. The only reason it gets 4 stars in my book is because I was looking forward to walking across the Brooklyn Bridge they had there, but it was under construction! Boo! Check out this hotel though, people! Take my word for it, it is very nice and one worth staying during your rendezvous in Las Vegas",3
"Went to Outback on Black Friday, not the best of ideas in the first place. Sat at the bar with a very nice bartender. She was attentive, but that was the only good thing. The steak was way over done and over salted, the soup was over salted as well. The overall experience was not good and I will not be coming back to this Outback.",1
"Sitting at the counter at FnB is an experience that should be had, period. Our reservations by default was later on in the evening, but also turned out to be quite fortuitous. Not only were we able to see chefs Badman and Curry in action, but also saw them turn down the kitchen towards the end of the night. It is a display that even the most advent epicurean is not often exposed to. There are no doors or walls to hide behind. Everything that you eventually place in your mouth is out in the open and also in the way it is prepared - from the raw, to the stove, to the plate. \n\nImpressive was also how fluid the kitchen moved with only the two chefs preparing dishes. Chef Curry preparing the appetizers, fish and fowl; while Chef Badman shoveled coal onto a grill and simultaneously manning it to ensure rib-eyes were cooked to order. \n\nThe ambiance was the type you'd expect when invited into another's kitchen, and the food tasted as if given the same attention. So to the service. Our waitress, Chantelle was nice about explaining everything to us after hearing that it was our first time there. When she found out we had moved just a few months ago, she was kind enough to write down her restaurant recommendations for us too. \n\nWill definitely be back to try other items off their ever-evolving menu. Reservation for two please. Yes its okay if its at the counter and yes, its fine if its late.",3
Chi is awesome. So creative and attentive. I love this place.,4
"The hotel is beautiful and a bit far from the strip but I am rating 1 star because of their customer service...\n\nDO NOT TOUCH OR MOVE THE LIQUOR. even to read it or look at it; YOU WILL BE CHARGED FOR \""SANITARY REASONS\"". If I had known I was going to be charged, for something I did not drink and it was still sealed, I would have drank it. However, I didn't so I'm paying for liquor I did not use. I had brought my own liquor and went on the strip to drink so I'm pretty P.O.'d that they are charging me $95 for two small damn bottles I could get for 20$ together... The main reason I did not bother even opening them or give them a second look. I think it's absurd how it's for sanitary reasons yet there was a big STAIN on my sheet but I tossed that aside and used my blanket I brought along instead to lay on and staff has to handle the bottle anyways. I wasn't really going to be in the hotel anyways (I was gone all day except for between 5am to 10am each day for the 4 days I stars there). \n\nI called customer service to dispute it exactly the day after when I noticed it and she was rude and did not give a **** and kept repeating herself three times when I did not ask about what she was answering with. I mean, sure I have the funds but the point is I was not aware or given notice of that charge. You are customer service for a reason - do not be rude. If I am paying over 700$ for a 3-day stay, I do not want to have an unpleasant experience. \n\nSO DO NOT MOVE THE LIQUOR OR ELSE A FINGERPRINT WILL GET YOU CHARGED. CHECK YOUR BED SHEETS (As. You should always anyways) and prepare to WALK far to the strip.\n\nI will not be taking my service to any MGM Grand hotel any further and I will let everyone I know to be careful or you will get a bunch of unwanted charges.

"Charlotte Tidbits threw their launch party at Alexander Scott, which is located basically at the corner of South and East behind the Fuel pizza. And boy am I glad that I attended. The building is quite large and stuffed to the gills (without hindering walkways) with furniture, throw pillows, jewelry, soaps/lotions, hilarious greeting cards, gorgeous paintings, and much much more. Spent a significant time walking through both floors (that's right - two floors filled with fabulousness) and found quite a few things I liked and a minimal amount that was just a bit too antiquey looking for my taste. \n\nThe staff was really friendly and helpful, and with such a wide array of options inside, this is the perfect stop for gifts for those hard-to-shop-for people on your list. Not super cheap prices but definitely not exorbitant, either. There is a private lot for parking, so swing on by next time you're in that area and check out the treasures inside.",3
"I ate here last week with my boss (she picked).  We had heard that this was a \""must try\"" restaurant and had received great reviews.  I have to say that it was good, but I have had better.  I felt the prices were extremely high for Mexican food.  They did tableside guacamole, which was I think $12 or something.  The place was really small, which I actually liked because it felt homey and relaxed.\n\nAll in all, it was ok.",1
"Neighborhood Theatre is a staple in No Da & I am so thankful they were able to weather the economy & stay open. \nTwo things that really stand out is the old school marquee sign out front & the history & \""open-mindedness\"" of the venue.

Ticket prices are reasonable, as well.\nThe ambiance doesn't say much, but the sound system is incredible.",3
"this review will be short, as although my time there was rather lengthy i only had one item off the menu.  well three really, as in three glasses of pinot noir which i can highly recommend.  the place itself is also quiet nice, loads of tablse and chair so easy to get a seat, not quite as easy to get the attention of the wait staff who insist on table service.  but overall a really nice place to go for a drink.",3
"New indian restaurant in St Denis. I came here with some friends on Saturday night. The service was one of the best I have had in my life. Super friendly and fast. The food was really good.

Good prices. I will be back!",3
"Horrible !!\nI had my doubts when I called to make an appointment at Frenchie's, but it's right around the corner from where I live, and I wanted to go someplace close since it was going to be a busy day. (You know how it is...work full time and need to spend your day off running errands.)\nOK--the woman that answered the phone had only a minimal grasp of the English language...no surprise there. But she was rude. When I asked her who would be doing my nails she replied, \""anybody\"". So I went this morning for my manicure at 1030am as scheduled. When I walked in every seat was full. An employee came over to me and I said I had an appointment. She asked me to point to my phone number in their appointment book. There was only one other appointment on the whole page besides mine. But she said they were full and I would have to wait about 30 minutes. \nWhat's the point of making an appointment if they take a bunch of walk-ins and don't leave anyone available for the appointment?\nI walked out. Will never go there again.",0
"Good price. Nice dining room. Great variety of food. We went right as breakfast was ending so we had the chance to try both breakfast and lunch. Best things to try are the bacon, omelettes, and ice cream :)",3
"Went here for dinner with two other people while on a business trip.  The food was actually pretty good.  It is located in a great area also, near a lot of interesting little shops.\n\nI'm not sure what the classification of food would be... it's eclectic.  I had the following:\nBlue Crab Appetizer - Crab and avocado basically.  The crab was tasty.\nScallops - Pretty Good scallops, not really a fan of the risotto.\nMushroom Pan Fry - Good.  I am a huge mushroom fan.  I really liked the mushrooms but the sauce was a little too much and possibly drained the tase of the mushrooms a little bit.\n\nTheir desserts are strange too.  I don't remember what it was called but it had the word lavender in it.  The ice cream was \""Earl Grey\"" flavored and actually pretty good, but the pie/cake thing was meh.\n\nAtmosphere is pretty much pitch black.  Prices are on the higher side but not too bad.  Parking will be impossible at dinner time.  You will have to valet it nearby for $5 plus tip.",3

"I really wanted to like this place! Before even trying it for myself I heard good things about this place, but the 2 out of three times I've been I have found hair in my food. Service was great all three times but the hair in the food just did it for me. I'm going to assume this happens often because of their dog friendly patio (where I sat all three times). They do have a great beer list and it changes weekly so if I do go back maybe I'll play it safe and just drink.",1
"I wasn't expecting that much from LAVO when I came here last Sunday night.  I heard things like: \""small\"" and \""just a lounge\"" from my friends who have been here.  But it was a Sunday night and I was with a bunch of dudes in Vegas.  LAVO was a good choice because my friend was able to put our group on a guest list so that non of us had to pay... I would have been free either way but to get guys in for free that is awesome.  We got there around 11:30 so we had to wait in a long line unfortunately.  Buzz kill!  Like literally, my buzz was gone by the time I got inside.  Drinks were free from 11-12 but we got in after midnight so boo.\n\nOnce inside around 12:15 they were playing some good house music so that made me happy.  But it was packed like a sardine can so your dance movements had to be limited to no movement at all.  My bf's cousin said that it was a \""sweat factory\"" inside.  Pretty accurate.  We were lucky to snag some of those light up foam sticks to dance with.  Even more fun to hit people with.  \n\nWe had to take a break outside because it was too crowded inside.  Unfortunately when we got back inside it was a hot dog festival and they were only playing hip hop music.  No bueno.  Party is over.\n\nTo sum it up, LAVO was better than I expected, mainly because I wasn't expecting much.  I still had some fun even though the club's physical capacity for fun was exceeded.  Fire codes must have been broken.  Pretty good party for a Sunday night.",2
"I went there when it just opened for a month or two. I was there maybe around 6 pm. It's been a while ago. But I still clearly remembered how disappointed I was. It took around 20 minutes for the server to take my order. And it took ONE AND HALF HOUR to get my steak. At least if my steak is juicy and tender then I can tolerate. But... the steak is like a cheap steak from your local grocery store. So chewy, I can't even swallow it, no juice at all. My friend also order a steak, same thing chewy like a rubber... especially $35 for two steak, so so so disappointed... \n\nMaybe it was only me, on the bad day at the wrong chef. But that experience will never ever bring me back to Herbs and Rye.",0

"I grew up in Asia so I am spoilt with the best Asian food. Decided to try this place because of the good reviews on yelp. Ordered Pad Thai with shrimp, soft shell crab and pad kee Mao.\nTook one bite of pad Thai and it pisses me off. They can't even do such a simple generic Thai dish right! Soft shell crab is super oily and tasteless, don't know why they put it on the menu board? The pad kee Mao is oily but tasty. I will not be going back. To be considered in my book of good eats, the restaurant needs to be consistently good every time I visit. This is not such a restaurant. Maybe we went on a day when the chef is depressed... Lotus of Siam is way better.",1
"This place seems a bit more upscale than the Olive Garden. The food was okay -- I'm not a fan of rosemary and that's an ingredient in their bread -- so I missed out on those carbs.\n\nService was great. \n\nKind of annoying is the paper they use over the tablecloths. It's supposed to be \""creative\"" and they have crayons on the table even if you don't have kids with you but it was annoying because it kept crinkling and seemed more in the way. Feels like a cheap way for them not to  have to change out the tablecloths after each guest.\n\nMeh. May return, may not. It's a chain...",2

"Okay I've had it up to here with this location. I've written letters before because they have been out of guacamole, chips, and crispy tacos numerous times. They always seem to be running low on something. This time in particular I went to fulfill my Chipotle craving and the girl preparing the food tells me they're out of chicken o_O I asked her if I could wait and she said no because none of the Chipotle locations in Las Vegas have chicken... Excuse me? Look. I need them to get it together because this is ridiculous. On top not having chicken at any location in town, this chick was rude about it. I'm sure she was annoyed because everyone had been complaining about the chicken all day, but there should've been a sign in front to give us a heads up before we all waited in line for the news. I settled for steak tacos but it was not the same. Guess I'll be taking my money to Baja Fresh.\n\nThis is all I got for Yelp but I bet they will be hearing from me.",1

Since I was new to the store, it would've been nice to learn where to find a club or how do I go about trying out a club I want to buy...instead, I learned it on my own reading pamphlets and hard to read signs and basically making assumptions based on what I observed...they weren't that busy, so my impression was that they were lazy.  I remember Golf Galaxy back in Vegas and how awesome their employees were...if they could come here to this place, it would be a perfect fit.\n\nReturn Factor - 90%",4
"Housed in the Chandler Mall, this one just doesn't cut it like the stand alone ones. I've found the cookies to be inconsistent in terms of texture and flavor - some days it's good, others I just wonder if they went a wee bit too happy on the sugar.\n\nSandwiches are ok, but I find there is always something distinctly lacking in their flavor. I just can't put my finger on it.\n\nWhile this is not my favorite location, when I want a sugar cookie or a chocolate chip cookie fix, this one sure beat Mrs. Fields.\n\nUpon reading other reviews, I could've sworn I've seen Paradise Bakery in California - southern california.",1
I love all the other Pita Jungles\n - sadly this location has been constantly poor! \n\nThe food here is 'hit or miss' and the service is terrible! \n\nEg.\nMy waitress actually rolled her eyes at me today and was pretty rude in general - \nyet still managed to get my order wrong!!!!\n\nI do not recommend this location!,1
"I scheduled a facial about two weeks in advance, and it was canceled by the facility the day of. I rescheduled for the following morning (with no discount, even though I had to provide a credit card number at booking so that the facility could charge me full price if I cancelled day of). When I arrived 15 minutes early as requested, the facility seemed to have just opened and the reception area was a bit chaotic.\n\nThe treatment room was not welcoming (so cold I had goosebumps), the products were harsh and inexpertly applied (the esthetician got glycolic acid exfoliator in my eye, didn't fully wipe all the product off of my face at the end of the service, and got lots of product in my hair because she couldn't figure out how to fasten the terrycloth headband), the massage portion was short, strange (arms and hands only,  no neck and shoulders) and poorly done, and the whole treatment, which was supposed to be a 60 minute facial, took less than 45 minutes including consultation.\n\nNot worth the money.",0
"I love Steak N Shake. This one, however, leaves a lot to be desired. The food often comes out cold and the servers are apathetic at best. Most of the time, they're downright rude. I highly recommend avoiding this location if possible. There's one on Route 51 that's worth the 15 minutes it'll take you to get there.",0
"Someone please update these poor folks outfits they have to wear to work here!!!!!!! Other than that, the dogs and the cheese on a stick are simply yummy!",3
"Although I 100% trust Joke's tastebuds ..if you've had Prince Street, Flushing Pho Bac or Pho Bang in Emhurst.. Pho Bac 97 isn't as good in flavors or clean. Not to be a snotty brat but it only made sense that when us three Queens girls treck it over here to Montreal's Chinatown but only from St. Denis (no biggie) to try this place (all over the tour books) we weren't too impressed.\n\nI believe the Sriracha and Fish sauce were in containers too... so no squirt bottle action.  \n\nThe decor made me feel like I was in a sad hardworking Alaskan family's restaurant. I can't imagine it in the Summer.\n\nNone of us got the vermicelli or rice plates but the only way I could explain it is that if those other spots I mentioned boiled their broth for 5+ hours then this place only did 2... \n\nSo if you're far from this location .. I'm pretty sure any other Vietnamese place around town will be the same.\nThe servers were all friendly gangster men and one of the main guys even gave us his card in case we wanted to go to any \""asian parties\"".. I believe his name was Chino or something close.",2
"Oh fitness ... my arch nemesis for so many years!\n\nYes, I have joined gyms large and small in the past in London, New York and here in the valley. Frankly they were all the same to me. Uninspiring dungeons with rows of hamsters running on wheels ... you know what I mean!\n\nSo then I stumble across Funktional Fitness when i move to downtown Gilbert and things changed. The first thing to say is that this is not a gym. It's a fitness destination where you can work out to make everyday activities easier while losing weight and getting fit. There are group classes, private sessions and even sessions for couples all run by coaches that are genuinely invested in your fitness journey. \n\nI have two private sessions a week with Coach Jeremy and Coach Luis and they are both excellent. My attitude to working out has done a 180 now that I see it can actually be enjoyable when you are in the hands of people that not only know what they are doing but actually care about your results.",4
A very nice buffet. Had a sushi area and a Mongolian style grill in the back. Have a lot to choose from for a good price. Tried just about everything there and all was well done and tasty. I loved the selection of sushi they had and went back for more. \nThe decor was open and bright and the place was clean....which puts it several steps above most buffets that are too densely packed or just plain filthy. \nWould recommend going to this place.,3
"I've only been to cans once and it was on a sunday afternoon, so I can't really comment on the crowd (the place was pretty empty). But I do know that I definitely wouldn't go back for the food.  I ate dinner at the bar and walked in starving, so everything on the menu sounded good. I asked the bartender for her advice and she told me that the hummus was amazing and that the mac n cheese was \""sooooooooo goooooood!\"" So I ordered the hummus to start and the mac n cheese as a side for my burger. \n\nThe hummus was.....not so good. It didn't have much flavor and tasted like a bad store bought spread. The burger was definitely nothing great, I actually didn't even finish it. I thought hey, the mac n cheese will be out of this world so I'll save room. Not so much. It looked like bad elbow macaroni with even worse cheddar cheese thrown on top of it, not even melted. And the inside was cold. I may go back to check out the rooftop and/or downstairs on a Thursday of Friday night, but other than that, I wasn't really feeling this place.",0
"This place is so disgusting. I wish I could give this place a negative amount of stars. \n\nI tried to sell clothes here and the girl told me she could only offer store credit then after she chose what she wanted, she basically made up a price. Once I asked her if they used percentages of what they would sell the clothes for (like EVERY other thrift store of this nature) her answer was just \""we're a family owned business\"". That makes no sense. The selection was ugly, disgusting and way overpriced. I couldn't find anything with my arbitrary store credit told the girl to consider it a donation, then she freaked out so I took my clothes back. I'd rather give my clothes away to Goodwill then sell to these people. Never go here. Not to mention how gross the inside of the place is and how poorly decorated it is. They have purses you would find at savers for $5 priced for $25.",0
"The place is in the basement of the Faubourg, which in itself is a terrible building.  It becomes a concrete bunker with extremely dim lighting.  I guess if you want to play pool or go bowling then you can come here since they have many billiard tables.  \n\nThey have a two for one deal on drinks, which is ok if you want to get drunk.  As for the atmosphere its either been really busy or empty.  The decor also could use some updating, unless that's the style they want.\n\nThe food is your typical bar food....its edible.\n\nI try and avoid coming here, but sometimes I can't get out of it because of others.",1
"The staff is very friendly and helpful. I didn't like the sugar free vanilla latte so they made me a chocolate one instead no questions  asked. The green tea is a little harsh for my taste, but the atmosphere is very laid back and more open than Starbucks.",3
"this place is the greatest BBQ joint ive ever been to. last time i came to visit family in the area Old Hickory House was the first place i went once i got into my rental car. i returned here once a day for the entire trip after that and in that time sampled the whole menu. the service here is great, helpful, and with a big smile!",4
"I was not impressed with the restaurant or the staff.  The atmosphere, service, and food quality really does not demand the price they are charging.  Drinks are really overpriced as well.\n\nThe runner got confused with our orders and yelled at me for confusing the waiter and \""handing \"" the plate to the correct person at our table.  The Lamb was delicious.  That was the most noteable portion of the evening.",1
"This is the second Sports Chalet I have been to and this one didn't seem as friendly as the other one. Walking around the store, none of the people that worked there said hello (like the other ones I've been to). I eventually found what I was looking for but I think I would go back to the other one in the southwest next time.",2
"Unless you're someone who could eat sesame chicken for days, Ginger Root is typically associated with lackluster lunch options and loooooong lines at noon. It might be because it's the only decent option for students nearby who can't be bothered to bring their own lunch or eat somewhere farther. The typical lunch selection includes beef with broccoli, red or green curry with chicken or shrimp, sesame chicken, and a veggie stir-fry. The consistency varies, sometimes it's too salty, sometimes it's not salty enough, sometimes there's too much vinegar, and the rice generally makes me sad. \n\nBUT WAIT!\n\nTheir dinner option, which I tried for the first time today, is something to look forward to. It's choose-your-own stir-fry, with the option of 3 veggies, 1 meat, choice of sauce, and choice of rice, all for under $7. Since it's made to order, it can be a bit of a wait, but then there's the sesame chicken bowl again, which would help you cut the line and save you from having to make any decisions.",2
"I had pork porchetta.  Delicious (mustard potatoes, house kraut (like a slaw with lots of vinegar - not exactly sauerkraut) pork belly, sausage and ham.  At $24, it was maybe (maybe) a bit overpriced, but it was pretty stellar.  My wife had a burger, which she said was great, and our friend had the Croque Madame which looked ridiculous.  \n\nHowever, it seemed that there was only one or two waitresses for the entire place, so service was really slow at times.  It was about 15 minutes between being seated and ordering food.",3
"Why oh why do they never have mushroom pizza on hand??  It's on their menu board and they never, ever have it.  I've been to Sirrico's a handful of times and this time, I was reduced to trying their lasagna, which was entirely too drowned in sauce.  I really want to like this place more.",1
"If your idea of fun dining is to wait 40 minutes in a crowded, noisy place for an overpriced slice of pizza then you'll like Oregano's. I'd rate it higher if I didn't have to withstand the aural and visual onslaught of Tempe visitors who can't be bothered to look anywhere else for a meal, and that's sad considering how much this town has to offer.  On occasions when coworkers insist on going, I do enjoy their salads.",1
"Sandwich and plantains were both good choices, but I thought the Aji sauce, a green chili sauce, was great. Loved the kick with the plantains.",3
"My girlfriend has been a regular of this place for years and could not wait to take me when I came in town for the Steelers game. We did not make a reservation and showed up on a busy saturday night around 8:45pm fully expecting a long wait. My girlfriend had forewarned me that there will be a wait so when we showed up we just expected to put our names down and go across the street for a drink while we waited. We ended up waiting in the front of the restaurant for ~20 minutes without anyone taking down our name. A few waitresses mentioned that the older italian guy (owner) took down names. We were ignored several times by him as he came up front - no biggie we saw it was busy. An older woman came up to us several times and asked if we had been helped, we replied no, and she reiterated that the older man dealt with the \""list\"". We were fine up through now and were still waiting when the older guy came up to the front and shoved the older woman (his wife?) and proceeded to scream at her for several minutes. The entire restaurant went quiet and was staring at the front of the restaurant (where we were awkwardly standing as well). The older gentleman was screaming that she was always interfering with the list and he was done with it. He kept going on and said that why did she even care about a couple of \""out of towners\"" who will never come back again. (which was even more shocking because my girlfriend was a regular and had regularly conversed with the man many times before). \n\nWe subsequently left while the man was still screaming at the woman. This was the most absurd display at a restaurant I have ever seen. My girlfriend was extremely upset especially for the physical violence the man was displaying. This was no casual shove but rather a full two handed violent push followed by pounding his fist on the table and screaming at the woman in front of the entire restaurant. Needless to say we will never come back and recommend people boycott a place where the owner treats his (wife/employee) with such disrespect regardless of how stressed he may be on a busy night.",0
"I walked over here one sunny Monday morning because I wanted some bread to go with my butter.\n\nPluses: The staff was super nice even in the face of my epic indecisiveness, the Glorious Morning muffin was delicious cakey goodness, the chocolate croissant has enough ever so slightly bitter chocolate for my tastes and the almond croissant was almond-y, although I feel the filling could've been a little moister.\n\nThe questionable: Why do your almond and chocolate croissants look exactly the same?? The counter girl was having trouble telling them apart and I got one of each instead of two almond. No big deal, I told her it was ok and to just guess when she was trying to figure them out since I enjoy chocolate croissants too.\n\nNow for the bad. I was super excited to tear into the baguette I got but the texture is all off. Don't get me wrong, its passable bread, but definitely shouldn't be called a baguette. The crust isn't crackly, the crumb is dense, the whole thing a little too chewy. It still scratches the bread itch but... that loaf ain't right.\n\nThe plain croissant, unlike its sweet cousins, suffers from the same problems a lot of American croissants do, being doughy and stolid and not flaky at all. Better suited to cradle some various fillings and be stuffed in a lunchbox than to be enjoyed on its own.\n\nSo overall I will probably be going back if I have a craving for sweets, but I'll have to find somewhere else with a baguette that suits my picky picky needs.",1
This is your typical airport bar.  Limited food options with a few decent beers on tap.  It is definitely not a brewery so the name is a little deceiving.  The fries are actually pretty good.  The burgers are ok.  Nothing fancy but nothing really bad about this place.  Have I had better? YES. Have I had worse?  YES.,2
"Tried to love it but I just can't!\n\nThis place has a lot of positives:  good location (for those not interested in schlepping down to Chinatown), nice waitstaff, and lotsa tasty banchan.   Honestly, best banchan in town (in my opinion).  You even get a free seafood pancake!\n\nBut, a tofu restaurant that serves bland (sorry) tofu soup.....it's a deal breaker.  I need flavor in my sundubu.  They just don't have it.",1
"OVER-PRICED and then some\n\n1. Lots of rules and restrictions when they have coupons\n2. EVERYTHING is more expensive here, it doesn't matter what deals or specials the website is running.\n3. No customer service at all, the only time they care is when you are there to sign up for a registry.\n4. God forbid if you have to return something, even with a receipt, they require your ID and phone number, WTF? It makes me feel like a criminal or something.\n5. I don't like to use them for a baby registry anymore. I feel bad for anyone I know and love having to go experience all the above mentioned points.",0
"This is strictly a review of the food. The service was good but the food could have been much better. I won't compare it or say I should have gone to XYZ, but its nothing to write home about in my opinion. Better options out there.",1
"I stayed here Sept. 21-23, 2014. My previous stay was a couple years prior. This is definitely one of the best properties in Downtown LV, BUT it was obvious that management had not a lot of money into keeping the hotel up. Hotels.com and other sites have it rated as 4-star, but I would put it as 3-star, particularly, when compared to other hotels rated 4-star. Casino has a good vibe, and decent sports book, though could use more seating. They have a poker room too with daily tournaments. The rooms are comfortable, beds are not too soft, and they have flat screen TVs. Best thing about the resort is the pool/shark tank. Cons: old town LV tends to be dirty.  Hallway carpets looked pretty dirty. Valet was slow.",2
"Food is great, but service is horrible. However it goes to say, \""you get what you paid for.\""",2
"I came back for Valentines Day and I was disappointed. I hyped this place up so much to my boyfriend and when we got there Banderas dropped the ball. Not only was our reservation pointless and a waste of my time, my prime rib... The meal I always look forward too, the one I hyped up so much, was COLD when I started eating it. My boyfriends was also cold. What a waste. The free desert they provides showed they didn't care, their offer to throw our meat back in the fire shows how they are ignorant that reheated steak is awful, their offer to send us home with new ones shows the clear fact they don't understand how they ruined our Valentines Day.\n\nSeriously Bandrea, what the hell happened to you guys? Truly, no longer my favorite restaurant...",0
"I too was dazzled by the gorgeous hotel but buyer beware, all that glitters is not gold. \n\nI stayed here for 2 nights and paid the $250 pet deposit (which is really $280 plus tax). Our dog is kennel trained and we left the room seriously spotless. Upon checkout I noticed that my credit card statement showed two additional $200ish charges on top of our room charge. One was a pending charge that they quickly removed after my first phone call. The other stubborn $200ish charge to my credit card has been impossible to retrieve. Every person that I've talked to at Cosmopolitan has agreed that I should be refunded that amount.\n\n\""It'll take 3-5 business days.\""\n\""It'll take 7-10 business days.\""\n\""Our accounting dept is only open M-F.\""\n\""I will fix the problem with accounting and call you tomorrow with an update.\"" - no call back from a service rep named Promise.\n\""Don't worry we took care of it. You got your refund and you'll see it reflected on your folio which I will email to you right now.\"" per a service rep named Joann. Never received the refund or the folio. \n\nI have yet to receive this refund after nearly a month after checking out and I feel violated. I'm planning my next move which is to call American Express and the Better Business Bureau. \n\nThere were other minor annoyances with the stay as well:\n\nWe were told that housekeeping would be up to put a sign on the door to indicate that we had a pet in the room. They never came and when I asked about it in passing they stated that they ran out of signs 3 months ago. \n\nThey advertise that they do 24 hr turn down linen service. They should give their poor workers a break because they seem understaffed and unable to deal with the volume of normal requests. We asked for extra towels once and got stood up too, like a lot of you have.\n\nAfter reading other sketchy yelp reviews about the hotel, upon check out I made sure there were no erroneous Mini Bar or movie charges. I checked out over the phone from the room and the rep that I talked to confirmed that I had no charges. She also never sent me the final bill via email as promised so lo and behold during the multiple back and forth phone calls, I discovered that I indeed was charged for something I never took. They did refund me for that amount  after I voiced my frustration over all the erroneous charges. ugh. I seriously hope I'm one of the exceptions. \n\nBottom line: The Cosmo does not respect your financial info. You may take a chance and decide to stay there anyway because it really is a fun hotel. However be vigilant about accounting errors because you could end up with more of a headache. \n\nIf anyone from accounting or management is reading this. I hope you read the negative reviews and discern if this is a system error that needs fixing. I have never had a horrible hotel checkout experience at any hotel, especially a vegas hotel before in my whole life. A serious disappointment and I'm unable to, in good faith, recommend that any of my friends stay here unless management steps up and corrects some seriously ill behind-the-scenes issues.",0
"The burgers remind me of Micnics, remember Micnics?\n\nThis is what I don't like about the place:\n1)  standing in a long ass line and having someone yell at me to yell my order back at them\n2) the buffet of fixings that allows you, flies and everyone else and their filthy fingers to make their own burger\n3) its dirty\n4) I smell like a grease ball when I leave\n \nI want to kick back and relax when I eat a meal, this place is too much work for too little pay off.",1
Filet with wild mushroom sauce was VERY petite (3-4oz) and overcooked. Told server but no offer to correct.  Otherwise food and service pretty good. But we are leaving a tad disappointed.,2
"AMAZING.AMAZING.AMAZING. Garth brooks is one of the most talented performers of all time! This is such a personal & intimate show, Garth would explain history of lyrics of other famous country stars then sing them. Amazing! He sang his own songs very heartfelt and with passion. Just him and his guitar. \nThis was the best show/performance i have ever seen. I have waited 20 years to hear Garth sing in person, and he did not disappoint! This was amazing, and to have his wife Trisha Yearwood join him on stage was an \""awe\"" moment. Everyone in the audience was stunned. Garth Brooks is still rockin it!",4
"Its been a few years since i last frequented Chicago Brewing.  I was really pleased with my recent visit!  Chicago was opened in 1999, and back then the craft beer and the menu would have been a real exotic in Vegas.  They have several slider hamburgers with odd meats like alligator, bison, kangaroo, and antelope.  These days, it might be just a novelty, but I loved it!  \n\nI had alligator sliders with the house stout.  My coworkers tried the house IPA, the cheese steak, and one of the salads (the one with tuna on it).  My alligator sliders were awesome.  They each had an egg sunny side up, a tomato, lettuce and sauce.  The dish came with a side of sweet potato fries.  I've never had alligator before!  It tasted kind of like a cross between fish and beef.  The patty itself was lightly fried with some spices that really made the flavor quite nice.  \n\nMy friends both enjoyed their lunches as well.  The salad wasn't the best, but it wasn't an iceberg bomb either.  The beer was pretty good.  Back in 1999, this beer would have been top notch.  Today, the West Coast style of brewing is to make bigger beers.  None of the beers crafted at Chicago are above 6.5%.  Chicago has kind of fallen behind the times a little, but the beer is still awesomely fresh.  You can see the brewery through glass walls in the center of the establishment!\n\nOverall, while not the best brewery in Vegas (ahem, Draft House), it is a real treat for craft beer drinkers.  The food is good too.   The restaurant is small enough to be cozy and intimate, so even non-beer drinkers should have a visit to check out the strange sliders or maybe a pizza!",3
"Staying all week at the lovely Cosmopolitan Hotel and had a couple of really good meals (pool grille and China Poblano Chinese and Mexican place) before we gave what looked like an interesting menu a try at Jaleo. \nFelt utterly exploited at Jaleo. Overpriced plates for very mixed results, drink prices ($20) that would make a hip Manhattan bar sit up and take notice (for nothing special, I might add). \nWe're getting reimbursed and I still felt jerked around and exploited. There are many better options within and nearby the hotel. Exercise those options! One bright light was the decor. That and an eggplant and pepper salad that we paid a ton for for two bites each but was very tasty.",1
Shame on me for not spending enough time in this pub. It's just along the road from me but I rarely get in there.\n\nIf you're looking for a quiet pub to while away a weekday evening this could be for you. Quite how quiet it is when Hearts play at home next door is another matter... I have yet to experience this.,2
This is my second review for this FD.  The only thing I eat here is macaroni and cheese and the corn bread. I have ordered the kids Mac and cheese so many times that i have lost count. Today they brought me KRAFT Mac and cheese and tried to say that's all they have ever served in the seven years she has been there. I told them no that's not true. I would definitely know. The manager came out and took it off the bill and explained the just changed the kids to Kraft.  This is the first time it took a long time to get our food brought out.   We will still continue to go once or twice a month because the food is good and the prices are good. This just happen to be one of their bad days.,3
"I had been in meetings all day so having a healthy lunch went out the door due to the intense hunger pangs.  I decided I'd might as well go big or go home and just get a whopper slathered in mayo and ketchup.\nFigured it would be quick since there was one person in front of me and no one in the parking lot dining in....WRONG.  After 22 minutes, I finally pulled up to the window to give the person my debit card.  I waited some more and finally got my meal 10 minutes later.\n\nOnly saving grace was the whopper and fries were piping hot; however it should not have taken over half an hour.  This is not what I call \""fast\"" food.",1
"Great experience. Truffled tater tots, deviled eggs w/ caviar and more truffles!, and a short rib benedict  with even more caviar!!! what more can you really say??? Sit down, relax and enjoy an overly indulgent breakfast or midnight snack.",2
great place to be a cowboy !!,3
"I absolutely LOVED staying at the Vdara, and will absolutely be back.  \n\nFirst off... if you're a smoker or a gambler, this may not be your thing, but for someone like me who doesn't smoke and really couldn't care less about being in a casino... this was AWESOME.  \n\nWe arrived in Vegas at about 10am on a Wednesday and right from the time we arrived in the hotel lobby, things went really, really well.  The person who was helping us with checking in was very friendly, chatty and very personable.  And, she  arranged to get us upgraded to a room that was one level above what we had booked, but because it was so early in the morning our room wasn't ready yet.  No worries - off to the pool!  \n\nWhen the room was eventually ready, we were duly impressed.  On the 51st floor and overlooking the Bellagio fountain with a super comfy bed and TVs on both the bed side as well as the living room side of the room... it was perfect.  There were only 2 very minor complaints about the room: one - that the water pressure coming out of the shower was pretty lame (though this was made up for by the fact that the water was HOT within seconds of turning it on); and two - that there weren't robes already provided in the room.  Minor, I know - but I'm a girl who likes to relax in a robe and slippers, and quite frankly, every other hotel I've stayed at on the strip in Vegas has just provided them in the room already.  Not a big deal as you can call down to housekeeping and have some brought up for you, but when you're fresh out of the shower and just want a soft, comfy robe to put on you want it already there in the room.  First world problems.  \n\nOther REALLY good things about this place were the concierge service people.  They seriously rocked.  Not only did they get our Cirque Du Soleil tickets printed for us and have them ready, but also made a reservation for us at a steak restaurant in a competing hotel that had NO reservations available when we tried to book earlier in the night.  Wifi was free in the rooms, and I was able to pick up signal in both the pool and lobby areas by just logging on with our last name and room number.  I also loved the pool area - there were tons of lounge chairs, umbrellas to put up when it got stupid hot in the sun, and the waitresses were always happy to bring drinks.   The mojitos were fabulous!!  \n\nIn short - I was sad to leave.  I would have stayed for another few days if only I had that much vacation time to take, but alas, as of Saturday night it was back to reality.  \n\nThanks to the staff at Vdara - we'll definitely be back!",4
"I realized after the fact I was charged more for services and swayed from getting the package deal I wanted because I was a local, and ended up spending a lot more money on a service.",1
"OMG OMG OMG!!! I'm somewhat hesitant to write how good this place is because I want to keep it to myself. My husband and I eat out 2-3 times per week and have eaten at just about every decent restaurant in the valley. This place takes the cake! Seriously... my new favorite place to eat... PERIOD! The service is amazing, the food is to die for. Everything is just perfect! The Yellowtail was so good it almost made me cry. If you want amazing food that is a totally different take the on the traditional Italian places, book a reservation STAT. You won't be disappointed.",4
"Came here on a weekday looking for some decent BBQ take out for lunch. At 15 past noon I was one of only three patrons in the restaurant. One of these days I am going to learn that's a bad sign. Cashier was slow and couldn't make change. I cannot believe that's just how they do it in the South and the place is trying to be authentic. The South is known for refined social grace and hospitality. Here I found neither. \n\nGot the pulled pork sandwich with potatoes to go. Pork was super dry and there was no sauce included. I would have expected them to put a container of sauce in with a to-go order. Bun fell apart in my hands.\n\nMashed potatoes tasted like one of the ingredients had gone bad, as if rancid butter had been used. Gravy was thin and greasy. Yuck. If this place got a health code violation I would not be surprised. \n\nOther reviews are either panning or gushing so the place may be hit or miss. There are enough complaints though about not so fresh food that I think it's best avoided.",0
"The kind of Thai food you want in the neighborhood. Well spiced, with each dish having distinct flavors. Not dumbed down. The kind of place to take your friends who know and like Thai food.\n\n4-stars, since we've only been once (which will be remedied soon, I'm sure).",3
"I had read all the Yelp reviews and purchased a Groupon for an oil change from Central Car Care. I am very disappointed. The actual experience was great during the service. One of the workers made coffee for me and the lounge area was nice for a car shop. I was advised that my truck needed a water pump, belts, and an alignment which I got done elsewhere due to a better cost. I think they were upset that I turned down the additional service because a week after the oil change I found out that none of my fluids had been topped off, that my battery and alternator were almost dead (no one bothered to check the battery at all during a 16-point inspection), and that my oil change gauge had not been reset.  I would not go back to this shop.",1
"Was walking around the area and found this place. It's a little tight with a few tables, but there's a lot of selections. During this visit, I got a chocolate croissant and tried their cocoa. I didn't ask to heat the croissant up since it was just made, but they did it anyway. So customer service was good. I'd recommend it as a good spot to rest if you've been walking around too much during afternoons when the weather sucks and you're wondering why you're visiting a country up north when it's winter!",2
Had a haircut by Christine. Like the haircut a lot. Great place and great price. Fast service. Will repeat,4
"Sounds like the groom shop folks need some training.  Same horrible experience for our little 12 lbs 6 months old bichon/shih tzu mix puppy,  We dropped him off last sunday morning for his scheduled groom and got a call an hour later saying that they couldn't get the job done as \""his eyes are all red from stress\"" and that he \""won't stop screaming!\""  Well, he's a 6 months old 12 lbs puppy, of course he's scared and will fight, but if they give him some treats and may be let him chew on a toy as we did at home, he'd actually enjoy the experience.  So we picked him up and took him home.  We did the job ourselves and he was nicely trimmed and washed without much incidents as we gave him lots of treats and chew toys.",0
"My husband and I went there for our friends birthday dinner. The food wasn't that great and the salad looked like it was from one of those salad bags that you can get at a grocery store. Our waiter was very nice, but the food wasn't so great. I think Olive Garden is better than this.",1
"We've been to Logan's quite a few times. They have a good deal Mon-Wed where you can get 2 full course meals with sides for $14. I'm a fan of their catfish, but overall they have good all American-fare cuisine. The staff is very friendly. Peanuts were a but gross.",3
"Venetian, you really let me down.\nWhy book guests on a floor that is slated for renovations? Why rush guests out from the room for said renovation, so much so that you further lack the supposed customer service your hotel is supposedly know for? \n\nThe hotel room was less then up to the standards for a hotel that would charge as much as this one did-the bathroom had a fine stench of urine. Did I mention that they were going to renovate the 5th floor, could this be why less than meticulous attention was paid to the room's maintenance?  \n\nFrom promptly 11 pm until 11 am the following morning, we were serenaded by the pounding, hammering and overall annoying sounds of renovations being made on the floor above. We were lucky if we got about 20 minutes of true sleep.\n\nMake a call to a \""manager at the front desk\"" and  you are given a the phony assurance that all issues will be addressed. They assured me that they would speak to the construction mgr to quieten down, as working @ 3am is not conducive to rest. That doesn't happen. They assure me that they will credit the spa treatment that shows on the hotel bill. That doesn't happen. The offered to \"" allow us to have late check out\"" This doesn't happen, they neglect to share this change with from numerous people that call up to the room to complain that we needed to be checked out nor do they share this information with the numerous people that knock on the door to state that we need to get out of the room as they need to start renovations.\nThey assure that they will offer a free nights stay for future use... how much do you want to bet that doesn't happen?! \n\nThe only bright spot is when I contact Nan Wong, Concierge to get preboarding passes for Southwest and as she offered, it was waiting for me at the Concierge desk when I am forced to checked out.\n\nTo those who want to stay at a high end hotel in Vegas, try the Bellagio!",0

"I have to agree with Korina on the sparseness of the Irish decor at R.T. O'Sullivan's in Glendale.  Honestly, if it weren't for the name of the place or the Ireland map and sporadic knick-knack here and there I wouldn't know I was in an Irish pub. I have yet to find an Irish pub in Phoenix that can outdo Rosie McCaffrey's in drinks, decor, service and experience.\n\nI met some co-workers up in this joint on a Wednesday night and enjoyed a happy hour mixed drink, a pint of Harp and a few loaded potato skins. The crowd was kind of light and the service was ok considering there were 16 of us\n\nA few guys were enjoying themselves with Big Buck Hunter and the electronic darts.  \n\nBut selling point for me??

Of course, I was the only one playing, but I am one seasoned trivia foe.  \n\nTwo stars, and an extra star just for NTN.",2
"Being my first time here, I was impressed! Did not stay the night or anything, but I did attend a Free Summer Yoga event by the pool. The turn out was excellent and everyone had a wonderful time! They offered a great happy hour after the workout, for those who attended the yoga class! I believe it was their normal HH, just extended for the rest of us who wanted to exercise first ;) The hotel pool was just gorgeous! Great view while the sun was going down! The bar area seemed to be pretty busy during happy hour and the tables and lounge chairs were available to order drink and food from a cocktail server even at 8pm when yoga had finished. There was also live music downstairs as we were leaving about 9pm. Their specialty drinks looked to be on the pricey \""Scottsdale\"" spectrum but the happy hour was great!! I am a big fan of deliciously experimented and tasting \""specialty\"" cocktails so I may have to return for one of these! Staff was ready and waiting and happy to help with attending to their guests! Always a plus when you dont have to feel like a pain in the....",3
Firstly it not Mexican. It's New Mexican. Secondly. Its good. Very good. Almost everything is spicy hot but with care some items can be ordered that are not. This may actually be a five star place for food quality. It's close.,3

"I should start by saying, the Spotted Donkey Cantina is the perfect restaurant for the over 50 crowd who wants to enjoy a higher-end southwestern food experience.  Honestly, my husband and I are not young... but were definitely the youngest couple in the entire restaurant by 15 - 20 years (excepting a few grandkids).   After pondering the reason for the older crowd, our food came and it was painfully clear.... the food is bland, perfect for that older crowd that can't handle spicy.    \n\nThe chips were delicious, best we've had in some-time.  They were thick with a nice strong corn flavor.. very nice.  The signature salsas were flavorful, but did not even register as mild on the heat scale. The pineapple salsa, we were warned was very hot... was really on the high end of mild. \n\nAside from the unspicy food..... I can honestly say my dish was truly bland.   My carne asada was a good cut of meat, the temperature was well prepared at medium-rare, there was the usual char... but the meat had zero favor.  No spices at all.   This was a dish recommended by our server over the Mole... I should have tried the Mole. \n\nAnd then there were the tortillas.  This was my biggest disappointment.  They tasted like store bought... you know, that thick floury flavor that Mission Tortillas have.  Even freshly heated, they would have been a disappointment.  Unfortunately, mine were served stale... hardened around the edges.  Invest in higher quality, homemade tortillas and ditch those store bought!\n\nMy dish came with Calabacitas.. which were disappointing as well.  While the overall vision was good, the squash to cheese ratio was way off... and my side was almost cold.  It was obvious the cheese had been melted at one point, but was well cooled before it reached our table.  Decrease the cheese, increase the veggies please!\n\nMy husbands dish was suppose to be enchiladas.  They were bland as well and resembled wet tacos. \n\nI have to say, the black beans were the highlight of our visit.  They were flavorful, still with some remnants of the salt pork with which they were cooked.  Some of the best black beans I've ever had.\n\nMany of the dishes, I would have liked to have tried.  But the sides were unappealing to me.  I don't like grits, sweet potatoes, or slaw (funny.. those are some of the only things I don't like).  The server indicated that they would not substitute for any other side... dishes were to come as prepared, sides and all.   She would have to ask the chef for permission to substitute a side dish.  Please, be more flexible when it comes to sides.   Also, I would have liked to see an Oso Bucco on the menu.   \n\nI should have gotten McGrath's signature green-chili mac-n-cheese or his green chili stew.  I know those are good!",2
This place is a must go eat!  It's in the old Imperial Palace hotel now known as the Quad. The portions are huge. I recommend sharing a dish.  My mom and I spilt the eggs benedict. It was absolutely scrumptious . The red cream sauce was magically delicious.  All the staff here was very friendly and our server Brie was pleasant and very attentive.,4

"I have only gone to Carlys on my lunch break and it made me late returning to work. Regardless, I did enjoy my food and time spent there. The waitress seemed a little stressed out, but then again she did have about 10 tables to deal with all at once.",2
Beautiful Hotel!!!!\n\nThis was the first time I have ever been to this hotel and it was amazing just walking in. I came here for a conference so I cannot comment on the rooms or even the hotel staff. We dealt mostly with the company putting on the conference. The lunch provided was great as well as sectioning us off from the guest checking into the hotel.,4
Bistro La Bon is at the top of my list of favorite restaurants in Charlotte.  As I was deciding on a place to take my sister for restaurant week I just really didn't want to be disappointed and though I would have liked to try somewhere new I just had a feeling that Bistro La Bon would be the place to go.  \n\nWhat an amazing job they did for restaurant week I seriously don't have a single complaint.  The portions were huge and they did 4 courses not 3.  I started with the mussels (prob my favorite food) these mussels did not disappoint leeks and saffron in this amazing broth with plenty of bread to dip.  My sister ordered the eggplant and mozzarella app and that was also extremely tasty.  Next up a salad nothing special but fresh and delicious.  I ordered the salmon for my entree it was served with creamy wasabi mashed potatoes and bok choy.  I know I have mentioned this in my reviews before but you can't leave this place without having the bread pudding it's the best dessert I have ever had.  I have had the famous bread pudding at Commander's Palace in New Orleans and it has nothing on the bread pudding at Bistro La Bon recipe please?,4
"We only went to this restaurant because it was late and we were hungry and had to settle for something. The rolls were okay - not fantastic and I'd definitely had better. Even the edamame wasn't done that well, only some of it was salted and the rest of it was bland. Luckily we went during happy hour and the prices were a little cheaper. I wouldn't really go back, though.",2
One of the worst car rental experience I have ever had and I travel a lot.  The checkin counter people scares you in taking their insurance.   Their tactics are terrible and should be reported.  The guy at the counter said the smallest scratch would cost 28 days of lost revenue.  Then when you went around the car the guy said don't report anything smaller than the length of a pen. So which way is it?  \n\nDuring checkin the guy asked if my father would be driving and he said it will be good to have two drivers.   He did not mention the additional cost per day for the additional driver.   \n\n\nThe car we got was so dirty on the inside you had to wonder if it was even serviced. Let's not forget the pre existing damage on the exterior of the car.  \n\nShuttle service was infrequent and the drive to and from the rental center took forever.  \n\nI will never rent from a fox again!!!!,0
"The Stratosphere is no doubt in Las Vegas's high pantheon of hotels, the casinos ,the rides and that. My beef with this place is that the restaurant there was far from the hype that is associated with Las Vegas food. It was pretty much average fair and just a bit tasteless-pretty much a disappointment I am sad to say. Go ahead and gamble and ride the rides but when it comes to eating? Go somewhere else.",1
"My only visits to McCarran are due to layovers from and to the East Coast. I've never ventured far from my terminal for the next flight.

Great service. Cool atmosphere. Trying the Sage chicken as featured on Man vs. food. Highly recommended by the staff.,3
"I was very impressed with the service, selection, and overall appearance/setting of this location.  I do a fair amount of shopping at the Famous Footwear location in Honolulu, and I don't mind saying that I would visit this location on future trips to Las Vegas.\n\nI liked the selection as far as casual and dress shoes, and was happy to have found a pair of Steve Madden shoes for an affordable price (in my humble opinion).  \n\nNOTE:  If you're a fan of Steve Madden shoes, there are more men's shoes selections at this outlet location than there are at the actual Steve Madden store at the very same shopping complex.  \n\nSERVICE:  Top notch.  Friendly and helpful sales associates are present throughout the store.\n\nBottom Line:  Great selections and customer service.",4
"I liked the food, but it was nothing too memorable. I do however remember being turned off by the service. I don't think I've ever had a hostess be so rude to me in my life. I'm a pretty relaxed person, and totally understand that the food service industry can be stressful....but when it's a Monday night and not crowded, the hostess rolls her eyes at you, doesn't say hello, and just grabs menus, I'm going to be a little bit upset.",1

"I came across this place while looking for something to do in West Valley.\n\nI concur with other Yelpers, this place is kid centric. Notwithstanding the pictures and artifacts about the Challenger mission and other space flight there is not much else to view.

January 28, 1986 was a snow day in Nashville and I was out of school.",1
"Shut your face.  Yup.  You.  Because I just can not believe, I have waited so long to come here!\n\nWhat have I been doing with my life?  Now, to be honest, this was our first stop of the evening.  So we had drinks and an appetizer.  Big mistake, I will tell you why later. \n\nWe were there during Happy Hour and happily, the Paloma was on the menu.  The Paloma is by go to drink and they did it well.  Tequila, lime juice and grapefruit juice.  Yum.  Trust me, people can mess up this simple libation.  My husband ordered a Manhattan.  Delicious.  Just fantastic.  Sweet but it packed a nice bite.  I wish I had ordered one myself.  \n\nWe also ordered the buffalo cheese curds.  They are the traditional cheese curds douses in buffalo sauce (kind of like a chicken wing).  They were amazing.  Completely different concept than I was used to.  I could only eat a few before my mouth were on fire.  I wish they had given us more dressing (or a larger cup) to cover the curd more.  They were so unique.  The traditional order is perfect for 3-4 people.  With two people, it was extremely filling.  The bottom ones that were sitting in the sauce got a little soggy.  I wish they did not have a pool of the sauce at the bottom.  Yeah, yeah, little things.  But I have nothing else to critique.  \n\nI liked the way our table was tucked against a pillar.  They had a couple of two tops that just float in the middle of the floor.  Those were kind of weird.  I would NOT want to sit there.  The decor and overall feeling was fantastic. The value was fantastic as well.  Two delicious (and large) cocktails with the appetizer was $20 even.  Not sure why I was not convinced it was a 5.  Just might have to go back and try some more.  \n\nSo the big mistake was leaving.  We were heading to Graze for an entree round of part of a progressive dinner.  We should have never left Merchant.  It was fantastic!",3
"My previous post did not show on the list so here it is again:\n\nWorst hotel ever! \n\nIf you believe in showing up to your hotel room with your bed not made and no toiletries in the room...book this place right away. There are only two elevators in the hotel that the hotel employees and guests share which makes getting to your floor anywhere from 5-15 min. Almost every day was a rude awakening when my room keys reset and would not let me in my room. This would not have been such a big issue except for the time that it took to get the elevator to show up to my floor and then return to my floor. \n\nOut of a week of staying in this hotel, my room was only cleaned twice and that was when I requested this. The cleaners do not speak a word of English which I guess is good if you would like to practice learning another language. I fortunately spoke Spanish but it was embarrassing for me to stumble through a conversation with the cleaners when I just needed a box of tissues and some toilet paper.\n\nThe elegant look of the hotel is summed up in one word...IKEA. Everything is cheaply decorated so you can bask in opulent trash while waiting for your elevator to show up.\n\nThe staff is very pleasant and does make you feel welcome. That is the only good thing about the place. Parking is $22 a day which is a total waste of money and the hotel bill was double charged for several days of parking.\n\nIn closing, I would not wish this hotel on my worst enemy.",0
"I would have to agree with everyone else, there is nothing good about this company. For one thing,have you noticed that anyone who says good things about Cox is someone who came from \""dial up\"" internet to them? Or else they work for them?\n\nTheir service is bad. Their internet is fairly fast when it works, but it is completely unreliable. if I had to run a business using their internet I would go under! It constantly goes completely out or just slows to molasses, necessitating a complete hard reboot of my modem and wireless router. Service people have been out several times and I have been on the phone with them every other day for weeks. I have lived at two residences since arriving in Phoenix  and both places had issues with Cox.The HD on my  HD tv looks like crap compared to when I was with Comcast. My On Demand is usually not working... the list goes on and doesn't even touch the rude jerks on the phone! To beat all, their prices for their unreliable services are exorbitant and I have yet to get any kind of refund for the internet I pay for and only receive on occasion.\n I am aware that my internet speed is affected by how many users for each node there is. I expect that speeds will decrease a little during peak times. I am also aware that I now live in the 5th largest city in the USA. Still, my internet should not slow to a complete crawl or completely crash at least once and sometimes several times in a day! \n I had Comcast before moving here and rarely had any problems. My internet was fast and reliable. I, personally, had good service from them. \n\nIf there was any other viable choice for fast internet in this area people would buy it over Cox. The only reason they are getting cable subscriptions is because of their internet. As soon as Fios comes to this area I will be getting that. \nYou would think Cox would take this opportunity to try to build a loyal customer base while people have no choice but to go with them.",0
"Wow, this place sucks. I wouldn't recommend this gym to anyone but an enemy. \nBesides the overcrowded facilities and broken machines everywhere, the billing staff is completely unhelpful.

There was so much going on, singing, activities, beer holding, butt spanking by the hot waitresses.... LOL!

"I have been a regular at Cabo Fish Taco for the past 3 years. I've told friends and family about how awesome it is and every one wants to eat there when they come into town to visit. However, my opinion about Cabo has changed in the last 5 months. The food has became greasy and tasteless. My once favorite shrimp tacos are made up of overcooked shrimp and a greasy a tortilla shell. I just wonder if management has changed or what has happened because it's really disheartening to see such a great restaurant go downhill. I continue going back hoping I've just had bad luck but each new visit doesn't leave me feeling more hopeful.",2

I have to say... it could use some updating. The chairs are old and hurt your butt and the TV'S need to be replaced.  It's a bummer when we go to watch a football game and the screen is fuzzy. With TV'S being so cheap it would not take much to replace some of the older ones.  \n\nThe food is hit or miss. There are some things that are great and others not so much.

"Ok, let me preface this by saying that though this is my first Yelp review, I'm not one of these folks who comes on here just to write one scathing review based on a single bad experience.  I've been reading Yelp reviews for a few years now, and always use it as a foremost authority before hitting up any new Vegas eateries.  My lady and I are also relentless foodies, frequenting restaurants of all genres and price ranges all over town and every time we travel.  I guess what I'm trying to say is...this ain't my first rodeo.\n\nFor comparison's sake, and/or to put my preferences into context, one of my favorite sushi spots is Sushi Mon on Sahara, which I find to be pretty darn good (not amazing, but good people, quick service, and good all-you-can-eat value).  We were a bit keen on trying a new place, and Naked Fish had been recommended to us by a few people.  So of course, I came on Yelp and saw nothing but pristine 4 and 5 star reviews.  Safe to say I was chomping at the bit to get in to Naked Fish and try it out.\n\nAWFUL.  To say I was disappointed would be the understatement of the year.  We dropped $130 and ended up getting Taco Bell on the way home.  The rolls were MINUSCULE.  I suppose that if you're a gringo and your idea of \""sushi\"" is rice, seaweed and ginger, this is the place for you.  But where was the fish?  It was almost impossible to differentiate between the different types of fish we were eating because the cuts were so tiny.  We ordered about 7 or 8 different rolls from their limited menu, and afterwards the only thing I was thinking was, \""Damn, these all taste the same.\""  \n\nI say \""limited menu\"" because the vast majority of their rolls were some sort of fried or baked varieties.  Those aren't really my preference as it's generally difficult to taste the fish.  But hell, maybe those would've been better than the nonsense we were eating.\n\nThat said, the sushi chefs were nice, though extremely slow, and the sake was delicious.  Unfortunately, I might feel that way because it was the only thing I had to help wash down the tasteless \""sushi\"" that I was (reluctantly) ingesting.\n\nI promise to review other places.  I love lots of LV restaurants; this is NOT one of them.",0
"Chinese is one of my very favorite cuisines and with few exceptions, seems to be missing in the Greater Phoenix area. Naturally, when someone suggested that I check Jimmy Woo's out on their grand opening night, I couldn't resist.\n\nWith two friends (Hipster Chris Galli and Vegetarian Kirti Dwivedi), I stand waiting to be seated in Woo's hip bustling dining room which in my opinion is the antithesis of the typical quiet, somber Chinese restaurant that seems to be the norm.\n\nThe decor is bright and stylish, the inside out bar serves as both focal point and gathering place for those enjoying a happy hour drink or waiting to dine. There are design elements to draw the eye (a giant, functional abacus occupies one full wall), attractive, attentive staff and the occasional fireball from the kitchen, I'm getting hungry!\n\nIn short order my party was seated in what for Foodies was the absolute best table in the house, a booth centered on the open kitchen where we could see the important stuff, the food being prepared!\n\nFirst up, a cup of wonton soup. I found the wonton to be well made, properly tender, tasty and the broth, once soy sauce and Chinese hot mustard were added, was quite good (the addition of crunchy deep fried noodles or wonton skins would have made this soup great.\n\nNext up came an order of pork dumplings which are served either steamed or fried (steamed in our case), these were simply beautiful and quite tasty as well alongside a small dish of traditional soy based dipping sauce. (our resident vegetarian enjoyed her 5 spice tofu lettuce wraps while the Hipster and I demolished the dumplings).\n\nA large, steaming bowl of fat egg noodles covered in a dark sauce with lots of ground chicken dubbed 'Woo's noodles' arrived next to my delight, the Hipster and I dug in (after the appropriate photographs had been taken of course). The brown sauce was rich and flavorful though a bit sweeter than I expected. (I would have preferred a little more heat as well).\n\nArriving next were Kung Pao vegetables and General Woo's chicken. The veggies were a mix of al dente broccoli, peppers and bamboo shoots stir fried with a spicy brown sauce and chopped peanuts. This dish was quite tasty with the right balance of crunch and softness, spice and sweetness.\n\nGeneral Woo's chicken is the house version of General Tso's chicken and my favorite dish of the night. Large chunks of crispy white meat chicken bathed in a sweet and spicy sauce seemingly evaporated before our eyes!\n\nOur final entr\u00e9e was Kung Pao shrimp and I'm sad to say that though it was good, this was my least favorite dish so far. Those who know me well know of my affinity for bold, spicy food and I really expected this shrimp dish to fit the bill but it was just lacking in the spice department. A quick conversation with Chef Andrew Nam revealed that the peppers used in the dish were not as hot as he would have liked and that a new purveyor was being sought.\n\nDessert followed and consisted of Fried wonton skins filled with raspberry or warm chocolate cream and dusted with powdered sugar, these were just the right note to end the evening on. I slowly savored each bite of the one chocolate wonton that I allowed myself (after all, there's my waistline to consider...) The lite, crunchy treat was just what I was looking for and well worth ordering.\n\nIn all I had a good meal, my dining companions and I were treated to great service and good, solid Chinese cuisine. Once Woo's gets through it's opening pains and adjusts a few minor things, it'll be a solid choice for the Old Town lunch crowd, a dinner destination and a definite social hot spot.\n\nSide note, on my way out of the restaurant I walked past the kitchen and there before me in all their glory were beautifully prepared spare ribs.  Stacked lovingly on their plate, an order or Char Siu Short ribs awaited delivery to a lucky diner.  I will certainly not leave Woo's again without eating an order of these, (more on that later).",2

"For what it is : a sandwich shop. With the different options of bread they have many varieties of fillings. Although not the cheapest, they are willing to take on unusual requests like a croissant with ham and fried egg. \n\nI do find that with larger orders they tend to mix them up, wrong bread type or not use the correct sauce. But I can understand that. The service has always been OK, a bit stretched at times.  \n\nA nice touch is that they have a Scone of the day and you pay a few pence less for that. \n\nThey do good business in the West End. During Breakfast and lunch times it get really busy so you can better phone in your order.",2
Employees are not the most helpful.  Always trying to sell more to you when you have clearly stated you dont want it or you dont want to pay that much for a product...Cant complain too much about the products themselves.  I prefer Sephora.......,2
"Great for a quick bite. The food is good although my chicken enchiladas seemed a little dry. I'm not typically a fan of Mexican-style rice, but I thought the rice and refried beans were yummy. My boyfriend and his brother really enjoyed their burritos so I'll have to try those next time.",2
"This is always a hit.  It's my go-to Mexican restaurant in the area, and the food never disappoints.  I wouldn't call it terribly unique, but the food is really, really solid and they have lots of great options.  I love the taco salads and enchiladas especially.\n\nThe one thing I can't figure out is their salsa strategy.  There are chips and two different types of salsa.  One is served in a little cup and is way too spicy for me.  The other (delicious salsa) is served in a carafe, so you have to pour it in something to use it.  Puzzling, but not a huge problem.  I definitely recommend Ajo Al's.",3
"I went to the store right after the new location opened.  Upon walking in, and up to the counter the employee was very abrupt and slightly rude.  This store does not excel at customer service.  I then placed my order and they told me they would bring it to my table when it was ready.  After waiting for 15 minutes I went back up to the counter and my food was there and ready, and they just told me \""sorry, we forgot\"".  By this time the chicken was slighly colder than I would have liked and when talking to the manger, she did not offer to re make the chicken and get it fresh, she simply apologized and sent me on my way.  The entire experience was not a pleasent one, and I do not visit this location for Raising Canes. I go up the the Centennial location.",0
"Wow. I've been going to Yasu Sushi since 2007. It used to be a fine establishment with great sushi. The past two times, however, I have been horribly sick afterwards. \n\nThe sushi rolls are very loose and sloppy, even though they take a long time to come out. \n\nTonight there were 3 servers and 2 runners, and yet it took 3 hours to complete our order. \n\nI had set up a birthday reservation for 6:30 for 6, and we were the only reservation for the night--I looked at the paper. They had sat two other people on our table. So much for reservations. \n\nOur server never refilled our drinks, nor did he get addition drinks without us tracking him down. \n\nA friend went to the manager that was \""too busy\"" to listen. Over $200 in food and drinks and you're too busy?!\n\nYasu was a great place. Now they are simply just another sushi restaurant in a strip mall. What a disappointment.",0
"This place should have Frozen Custard larger than steak burgers on the sign, because that's what keeps me coming back for more.  \n\nI would actually say the burgers are average and aren't all that memorable (I'd rather have IN-N-Out, and even Wendy's or Jack-in-the-Box over their burgers).  The fries and chili fries are good .  \n\nThe concrete's are really where it's at though and I get a craving for them once or twice a week.  I've only been through the drive-thru, but the staff seems pretty friendly (but most places around the area seem that way as well).",2
"I wanted to choose something special for my 100th review.  It has to be something near and dear to my heart...I choose to rate my most favorite professional sports team, the Pittsburgh Steelers.\n\nBeing that I was born in Western Pennsylvania and raised in Pittsburgh during the dawn of the Steel Curtain, the Immaculate Reception, and the four Super Bowls in the late 70's and early 80's, it is hard to find a better reason to not rate this sports team a 5 Yelp Stars.  Now that the 21st Century is started....2 more Lombardi trophies were added.  I am not saying dynasty, but this team has a history of success and it is not hard to say for a small market team...this team is very successful.\n\nAs a fan of National Football League and the Pittsburgh Steelers, this team is a model for the way other organizations should be managed.\n\nDallas and San Francisco are in the holding pattern at 5 Super Bowls.  New England, New York Giants, and the Indianapolis Colts' does not have the history and only time will tell.....here we go Steelers, here we go!!!",4
"Alright so no smoke and mirrors here, it's pretty much straight forward.  The steak dinner/steak and egg special for around $6.  It used to be around $5 but it has gone up in the last couple of months.  That's about the only thing I go here for.  The staff is nice and the surroundings are nothing to write home about.  But if your in the neighborhood and you wanted some steak for a good price you might want to stop by and check it out.",2
"Sunday evening and we were going to go check out the new Target and since NY 54 is just across the parking lot we stopped in.  Our server, Jessica, was great.  She told us that they had Happy Hour specials with $2 off appitizers and specials on imported and domestic beers and wine.  Wow, Happy Hour on the weekend!  YAY!  Most places don't offer that at all.  So we ordered some mozerlla sticks.  They were really tasty and my daughter loved them. The pizza here is very good.  A crisp crust on the bottom, fresh toppings and just the right amount of sauce.  I'm really not sure why there are not more reviews for this gem.  People you have got to try this place!!!",4
It is not worth its price. The food was not as fresh as expected and not appetizing. For the price Wynn Buffett is much more worth the price.,0
"Early Thursday morning lunch, and after a night of a few libations, onion soup was just the thing I needed.  It was one of the best onion soups I have had in a long time.  Nice balance of flavor and a healthy portion of cheese and a nice crouton inside.  \n\nThe sausage pizza looked amazing and had some large pieces of sausage on it with a well balanced pizza sauce.  \n\nService was very good and the manager came by since we were the first guests today to say hello and let us know the pizza would be right out.  \n\nI would recommend this place to people who enjoy good food and love sports, since there over 70 TV's here.\n\nI would have posted a picture of the onion soup but the bowl is empty!",4
"I went here once while I agree that the chicken is good, I easily get turned off eating when the dining area is a mess while the store is not busy. I would understand that if it was busy, but it was 4pm on a Sunday and total of 3 people dining in.\nI try to keep my reviews professional, but it's not great seeing napkins on the floor and some sticky stuff on a table. Ugh,\nThe staff here are friendly and nice, but  seriously speaking, someone take time with the dining room!",1

"Worst car buying experience I ever had! I tried to make it easy by paying sticker price. I just wanted to get a new car (it was used but new to me) and be on my way! I was still there for over 3 hours and when the salesman and I had come to an agreement I was still hassled by the finance department. It only got worse. The car only has 1 key so Will, my salesman,  reassures me he will order me a 2nd key and deliver it to me when it comes in.  I get home and there's no owners manual. I call Will and he tells me he  left it on his desk but promises to bring it to me the following day. Several days later I have to call again and then I finally get it. I'm still waiting on my 2nd key. Two weeks pass and not a word. I call him again. He tells me, it came in but it was the wrong key. Keep in mind that I had to call him to find this out!  I wait a couple more weeks, hear nothing and call again. \""Oh, yes it came and I was going to drop it off to you yesterday but I worked late, I'll bring it to you on Thursday \"" . A week passes, no key, no phone call. I have to call him again. I get a BS story about how he needed to mail it but it came back to him, could I give him my address. You mean the address you have on the paperwork from when I bought the car! I tell him I'll just pick it up! I finally get the key fob today and discover when I get home that it hasn't been cut or programmed so it doesn't work! I'm still waiting to hear back from a manager! Do NOT GO TO VOLVO OF TEMPE! TOTAL NIGHTMARE!",0
The good - decent selection of average beers\n                  - great patio good location\nThe bad - By far the worst service as far as response time going back in memory quite a while.  Make sure you order and have time..  our food was 35 min to the table but had to put our order in with another waitress as we couldn't find ours.,2
You never know what your going to get a this place... Nice peaple behind the desk..... But  idiots in the shop..... Got a oil change.. Got home  oil all over the frame and the oil cap was not screwed on... The next oil change the wrote on my sticker was wrong. And the kid doing the oil change just wanted to talk about my daughters rims.... Learn your job.... Or maybe go apply at big lots...ooooooo and by the way the said we need to replace the battery... It's a week old....  And they never checked it,0
"I never thought I would see the day that I would be giving Postinos anything but a 5-star review because I've been going to Postinos in arcadia/phx for years and have been going to the new Gilbert location for the last 8 months, but ....and let me scream so you can hear me....,\n\n \""THE MUSIC IN GILBERT IS SOOOOO LOUD YOU CANNOT CARRY ON ANY KIND OF CONVERSATION!!!!!\"" \n\nThere.  I feel better.  Two other couples at tables next to us screamed \""Wow this is loud music\"" as well....  It is not like this at the other two locations.\n\nManagement at Gilbert.... turn it down a notch or two.   A wine bar should be classy, relaxing and have an atmosphere condusive for great conversation, and all of those are impossible with the extremely LOUD music!  I would probably have ordered another bottle of wine, but I literally could not wait to leave!\n\nAlso, for the very first time EVER, when I ordered the butcher block there were items on the block missing!!  WTH???!!!  \n\nOther than those two things, everything was spectacular...food tasted amazing (after bringing the missing items), service, people friendly...but I want to be able to carry on a conversation!  \n\nThank you!",1
"I stopped eating out at basic Italian places because... Heck I can fix most of these items better than they do!  This place is no exception. \nI only come here because my \""special\"" somebody (as in he is really special when it comes to his taste bud or the lack thereof) truly thinks this place has the best pizza. My dear yelper friends, read my lips, they do NOT have the best pizza.  Nothing here is memorable. To be fair, their food are edible and especially if you are hungry and you are stuck out that way (hence 2 stars)  \nTruth is their marinara sauce was tart. I had to work on it at the table in order for it to not taste like it came from a can. Meatballs were blend and a little tough. Pizza looked under-cooked. \nService was never great. I really think it is a waste of a restaurant because they obviously have a core support group in order for it to be still in business. So either all their regulars do not know what real and good Italian food taste like or... Sadly I can't think of another reason.",1
"My gf & I went to this place as it's always on travel channel's best place to chow down. My expectations were pretty high on how good it look & the way tv made it seem. Well when we went there, first it wasn't busy so that was a warning sign I should've noticed. Place is tiny, only 4 tables but it was not busy at all so finding a table was easy. My gf ordered the cheeseburger, I ordered the pastrami & we shared chili cheese fries. I also got a strawberry, banana smoothie. What I didn't know, I was paying full restaurant prices as our food total for that meal was almost $40. I was shock how expensive it was for a fast food place. We waited like 15 mins for our food. When we got it, it was ok, not worth the wait or price. The pastrami really had no flavor, the bread was too crispy where they toasted it too long. My gf burger was just any generic burger you can get at any burger place. The chili cheese fries were pretty good & smoothie was good also but pretty big. It's not bad just is not good at all which I definitely would not come again.",1
"Burrito snobs beware - this place is not for you. The tortilla's gonna break, one bite'll be nothing but Guac, next, rice, you won't find your Add Jalapenos until the very end and fry your tongue on them and leftover, burrito-bottom Tortilla.\n\nBut you gotta love PB for their Classic status - like Lupie's nachos, like Dish's meatloaf, no matter how cool Burritos have become, they've made 'em this way, it's staying this way. Kind of a bummer, because I want more than just peppers and zucc in my 'rito - but kinda awesome, because beans, rice, tomatoes, cheese, various veggies, lettuce, sour cream and guac, should be enough for my Belly. Just cuz there's 6 options for meaters up there and all I get is squash, well, so be it.\n\nWhy is the rice white, why is the sky blue. These questions have no answers. So get what you can and eat it quick before it explodes all over your face/lap/shoes.",2
"Trendy fashions and affordable is what comes to mind about this place. Although majority of the the sizes tend to run small. So if you have the more curvy hips and bigger bust size then I would pass this store up. Other than that you'll find some fab club/party wear. \n\nAmbiance/Service-Good! Organized,easy to find by size and I like how everything is sectioned off by color. Staff both on floor and at registers have always been helpful and friendly. Located in strip mall with other bargain based stores. \n\nTake into account quality wise, it's throwaway clothes, it's inexpensive and you get what you pay for basically. I find some outfits will only last through a couple of washings before it falls apart. But go for it! It looks great for first time wear.",2
"Went back again to give this place one more chance on a Friday night during Lent.  I shouldn't have.  And, I should have known, because the place was almost empty on a Friday night, during Lent.  I ordered the same dish as before; cod was still bad.  It didn't end there though... I was given marinara sauce instead of cocktail sauce for my shrimp, and half of my hush puppies were straight up RAW inside.  Once again, I left disappointed, and will not be back again.  It's a shame, because we need a good fish restaurant on this side of town.  Sadly, this isn't it.  Still two stars though for their awesome potato salad (it's now really the only thing I can count on there), and so-so service.  Not good, but not horrible either.  I'm wondering if it's worth trying the original location that I fell in love with, but not sure it's worth the risk for the price.",1
"I am a regular at Jamba juice, part of my new healthy diet. The banana berry with soy protein is my favorite. The staff at this location are not efficient. Takes time to take the order & when ready, they don't announce. So you could be waiting more if you don't ask. Their screen to add points on one of the cash registers does not work. I have lost points on more than 3 visits now. Bit frustrating and no apologies from the staff.",1
"Good shrimp. So so ambiance, good service. The rest of the food was a bit disappointing.",2
"mediocre overpriced thai ! \nI dont know how it manages to get great reviews on yelp...strange entree pricing small and regular .... i mean c'mon basically have less and pay less.....or order our overpriced regular portion size. May be its something to do with its art dist location but we were there for dinner based on yelp reviews. Curries were nice. Steamed rice was sent away , it was cold lumpy cruchy burnt...although they got us fresh one right away as when we mentioned...overall not bad but for that price probaby expected more....",1
"Wish I could tell you about the food but the poor service overshadowed the meal. The staff was friendly enough but failed to provide the most obvious of necessities. Exhibit A: drinks. I requested a glass of soda from not one, not two, but three different staff members. Finally, when there was still no sign of the drink, I asked for them to just bring it when the food arrives. One waiter said, \""could you remind me to do that?\"" Umm, isn't that your JOB to remember that? They seemed inattentive to their customers yet spent a great deal of time arranging silverware on tables that weren't even occupied. How about focusing attention on the warm bodies sitting here now?\n\nExhibit B: the bill. At this point, I was pretty annoyed and obviously in no mood to leave a big tip. But the waiter stands at your table with his credit card machine and processes your bill right then and there. AWKWARD.\n\nTo my Love, I'm sorry to have taken you here on your special day. Happy effin' birthday.",1
"Expansive store carrying a wide selection of everything you can think of for your home. From sofas, to wall clocks, grandfather clocks, and silk flowers, the items here exude a warm yet sophisticated air. \n\nFor some reason they also have a plethora of small little dog statues also placed around the store, adding a cute atmosphere to the mix. \n\nThe associate here seemed fairly disinterested in our browsing, but was at the center station in case we needed to ask him anything.",3
"This was my first time here. I came to the indoor bar to order a drink because it was far slower than the outside bar. The bartender (short curly dark hair) did not sad hello, seemed annoyed to make my drink, did not speak or smile once. This is terrible customer service.  And even after tipping she just slowly walked away without a thank you.",0
"Alright LGO. After several visits and some hard consideration, I will admit that you are probably one of my favorite places in the valley. Now i'm not a \""Regular\"" because its too far of a drive for me, but LGO has become that place I think about when I want to treat myself (queue in parks and recs: TREAT YO SELF), bring people from out of town or just suggest a place to eat where I know most people will be happy: it has a variety of options, its not too expensive and the environment is nice but not upscale. See? everybody wins.\n\nThus far I have managed to try 3 things:\n\nROASTED CORN PIZZA\nThis is the pizza that Yelp keeps raving about, and I have to say one thing: IT NEEDS MORE CORN. Like tons more corn, its a corn pizza after all, right? I thought the thin crust was great, it was crunchy, it had a nice olive oil drizzle and the cheese was abundant. It was a decent size and it fed me leftovers, which ended up quite well in the toaster oven. Its a great dish to share, especially if.. you know.. it had more corn. (Okay I'll stop now).\n\nSALMON SALAD\nThere are now two salads that I believe are the best thing in the world: the Stetson Chopped from Cowboy Chow and the Salmon Salad here. It came in a plastic box for takeout and I swore I was buying airport food. I didn't even eat it right away, I ended up eating it the next day because my plans changed. I did not expect it to be this good. The fresh salmon, the combo of spinach, arugula, basil, the creamy pearl cous cous, the crunchy seeds and nuts and the dressing. Everything worked perfectly and the portion was very filling for a salad, but definitely doable if that's the only thing you're eating. I made sounds while I was eating it. Yummy sounds. It was awkward.\n\n\nWILD RICE SALAD\nThe dressing on this salad is the bomb. Luckily I ate it at home and was able to disgracefully lick it clean without anyone looking at me and calling the creep-bulance. I also loved the crunch it had and the flavor of the fresh herbs (don't remember if it was cilantro or mint, but it was strong!). It was pretty filling and pretty great pairing it with any meat. It didn't feel like I was eating a bowl of carbs so my guilt feeling was kept at a minimum. Woo!\n\nSo, so far so good. I have many more things to try at LGO and many more yummy sounds to make. Its all about the journey, and let me tell ya, I'm excited.",4
"I hung out here for two solid hours as part of a scavenger hunt, and I've definitely experienced better.  First of all, I got zero cell phone reception... apparently, there is no Verizon service in this area, although the waitress told me they were building a tower \""soon.\""  So I tried to use WiFi, but the network is restricted to guests of the hotel, which I was not, so I was S.O.L.  I figured to at least drown my sorrows in a drink or three, but at $9 for a Bailey's & coffee I could not afford more than one (the game only paid me $75, for chrissakes).  On top of all that, the place is dark and gloomy and depressing -- you would think that with all those windows on the outside, City Center would be airy and spacious and full of light, but the interior (of Aria, at least) is all dark wood finish and low lighting, so much so that I felt a bit claustrophobic, like I was trapped in a coffin full of slot machines and bourgeoisie!!\nOn the plus side, the seating was plentiful and very comfy, and the waitresses were attractive, pleasant and friendly, and checked on me often.  I think it's one of those places where they hire based on looks, because it was all 20-something babes... but their uniforms have these unfortunate gathered bunches at the sides, right where your saddlebags would be, and it makes them all look hippy and fat, which none of them were!",1
"[3 Stars by PHX comparison and 2 overall] \n\nMy quest for Indian food in the valley continues. Call me spoiled but I have had some GREAT Indian food (on and off a buffet) and everything after that is relative. I also learned to make a few of my favorite dishes for those times I lived in the boonies and couldn't easily get my Indian fix. \n\nCraving Indian food for Sunday brunch, I recall a restaurant that many of my friends have tried and enjoyed, Royal Taj. \nPopped in just after noon, its not busy. The ambiance is warm and cozy. I request a booth and decide on the buffet. It is small but contains the standard fare, basmati rice, saag paneer, a lentil (dal) dish, a chickpea dish, veggie pakora, masala paneer, chicken tikka masala, chicken vindaloo and tandori chicken. A sign above the buffet says that Garlic Naan will be served at the table. \n\nPicking up my large plate and put rice at the center and put a little of just about everything around the outside to try. As I served the saag paneer I noticed I didn't see the chunks of paneer I often do with this dish (maybe they blend it in). Plate full and serving myself up a cup of warm chai (included at the buffet) I sat back at my booth. Shortly there after my naan arrives HOT and fresh. I pull apart a piece, crispy on the outside and soft interior. The garlic not as prominent as I would have liked, but as I would find out soon the naan was the main redeeming quality about Royal Taj. Five stars for the naan!! \n\nThe rest of the food was lack luster, not bad just not that good even by Phx standards, the pakora were stale and the masalas thin. My relative favorites from this buffet were the chicken vindaloo, the saag paneer and the chickpea dish. These were seasoned well, although I missed the chunks of paneer in the saag. \nThey had 2 of my most favorite desserts on the buffet, kheer (sweet rice) and the gulab jamun (pastry balls in a cardamon honey syrup). The kheer appeared strangely thick, but I didn't think much when serving it. When I finally got to the table and had a bite....did they use yogurt or buttermilk? There was a strange cultured milk flavor that was not typical of most kheer, needless to say this was the first time I didn't finish my kheer (when often I go for seconds). The gulab jamun on the other hand were great, homemade, soft and melted in your mouth. 5 stars for the galub jamun. \nThe buffet was @ $11 with tax, which is about average but high considering the quality was just barely ok. \n\nMy search continues...which several other places in the Valley yet to try, I doubt I will be back....",1
"Good drinks but could use some assistance in a better menu.  Bar food is stepping up their game all over the nations.  Four Peaks didn't get the message.  My breakfast was cold and the avocado was moist free.  The tortilla was still dripping flour on the outside and the potatoes were a hot, hard mess.  I did have a great coffee and Bailey's to their credit.  Not much else.  Service was courteous and he comped my breakfast.",1
I thought that I would give them a try while I was in town. I tried their chicken platter as it was suggested by the hostess. I explained that I really enjoyed chicken shwarma and I I was told that this was  their version.\nU was disappointed with their rendition.,2
"This is an atypical review for Pizza di Roma as I'm basing my review on my carryout experience rather than the usual eat-by-the-slice experience of most of Pizza di Roma's customers.  \n\nI recently ordered a 20 inch La Caprese Speciale (fresh mozzarella, tomato, basil, red onions & green olives).   Far such a large pizza, the crust held up extremely well.  While not as tasty as the top echelon of Madison's pizza royalty (Grampa's and Salvatore's), I found it tender, light, and flavorful.  \n\nThe copious amount of toppings overwhelmed the sauce component - it was very difficult to taste the sauce under a heap of tomatoes and fresh mozzarella.  \n\nWhile I give Pizza di Roma high marks for topping quantity, quality was more of a mixed bag.  For early April, the fresh basil was outstanding.  The red onions were fresh and did not have any bitterness.  The fresh mozzarella was just OK as were the green olives.  \n\nThen there were the fresh tomatoes.  Granted, you're not going to get high quality tomatoes in Wisconsin this time of year, so the fact they lacked flavor and had a chewy texture was not surprise.  The other problem was the size of the tomato cuts.  I know they were trying to replicate the feel of a caprese salad, but the whole slices of tomato made the pizza difficult to eat as the tomatoes kept sliding off the pizza.  Another problem with the tomatoes was they gave off a LOT of moisture, creating an extremely soggy pizza after 30 minutes.  In the summer, this would be a much better option when the tomatoes are ripe and fresh, as long as they drain off the excess moisture.",1

"I really hate writing bad reviews for small businesses...esp ones in my neighborhood.  \n\nNot that our opinion is life changing or anything dramatic, it's just that I really have high hopes for small businesses, really wanting to find the diamond in the rough...the place no one else has really discovered yet...\n\nIt took me weeks to decide whether I was actually going to post my review...well here it is :\n\nCan't come to a place called Wing Heaven and NOT try the wings first right??\n\nI tried the 10 Wings Meal ($12.49): Spicy Garlic, Honey Heaven and a 1/2lb Fries. The flavors were just ok...I did like how crunchy the outsides were though.  \n\nThe owner (presuming) mentioned that they marinate/batter the wings twice, before the fryer and after, so they get extra crispy and a bit more flavor.  I wasn't overwhelmed with the food flavor though...\n\nBut the reason the review is so low, was the fact that my chicken wings were NOT FULLY COOKED.\n\nI bit into the first one or two and noticed they were a little pink on the inside.  Nothing horrible like blood or super raw, just a bit pink.  Just enough to worry a bit, but my iron stomach was telling me that I would be ok eating a little bit of the \""less pink\"" ones.\n\nI started ripping them apart and they were all pretty much the same.  I ate up the wings that I thought were \""more cooked\"" but I ended up getting sick afterwards.  AND for the next 2 days.\n\nI am sure I could have went back into the store and asked for him to cook me a new set.  I am sure the customer service would have been great and it would have been done with no issues.\n\nBut I didn't do that...and I got sick...so we are both to blame.",0
"There was no wait. Service was okay. Food was okay. The shrimp on the spicy shrimp pizza wasn't evenly distributed which kind of bothered me. Lol I ordered the garlic cheese bread. Not special. Their pizza special was philly cheese steak and it kind of sucked. The server said it was a pepper jack sauce/cheese but it was just reg cheese. We ended up giving the left overs to a homeless person on the strip. I ordered a drink which took a minute to come out because they had to grab eggs for it. Which I didn't mind, that's the only reason why I got it. Hahah. The bartender sent over another drink though maybe cause he felt bad. Regardless, they were both good! But... I dont think I would come back again.",2
"we came for the strawberry creme brulee waffle, but i was loving the eggs benedict so much more. don't get me wrong, the waffle fluffy interior & crispy exterior were delicious and fabulous, but what i expected in the execution was not even close. i think the cream, which they were calling vanilla creme brulee did not take my taste buds to the awesomeness of creme brulees. it was sweet cream. i guess i was expecting burnt crystalized sugar...that was it!\n\nso, why 4 stars? despite my expectations being shattered. the food is good and top quality! they give you a huge cafe mug for coffee. the house potatoes are everything you can ask for. and, this an overall solid restaurant. we will go back, for sure...minus the strawberry creme brulee waffles, which should really be renamed the strawberry cream waffles.",3

"Blind Pig Co. (not to be confused with the Brewery, also in downtown Champaign, which just opened recently) is a full-service bar in downtown Champaign. The Blind Pig (as I will refer to it for the rest of this entry) differentiates itself from other local bars by offering a HUGE selection of microbrews on tap (well over 20 at any one time) , as well as a large selection of beer by the bottle. This huge selection is one of the reasons this is my favorite bar in Champaign, as well as the fact that you can get a five beer sampler (of any draft beer) for just $8.\n\nThe Blind Pig changes its menu weekly, with different beers entering and leaving each time. Another thing I like about the Pig is the fact that it is one of the few places I know of where you can get beer in a cask, which is just for unfiltered beer, and lets the beer continue to age and ferment while it is being stored. Considering the rarity of cask beer, at least in my experience, this alone is a good enough reason to stop by the Bling Pig. There is a different Cask every week.\n\nThe Blind Pig also has special events at different times, depending on when the event takes place. These events usually involve some sort of drink special or giveaways. As an example, I attended the Blind Pig's 5th anniversary party just a few weeks ago. A representative from Rogue Ales, one of the first microbreweries in America, was present, and giving away t-shirts. I was lucky enough to get one when I got a Rogue Old Crustacean Barleywine (which was delicious). In addition, there was a selection of 6 Rogue drafts and a Rogue cask, with all pints being $5 each (a rather good deal for Rogue at the Blind Pig).\n\nThe Pig tends to draw an older, off-campus crowd. As such, it is usually less crowded and rowdy than on-campus bars, though it gets busier on weekends. One of the reasons I like to go to the Blind Pig is that it offers a different kind of atmosphere that one cannot find in other bars (especially those on campus), as well as the superior beer selection.",4
"Loved the food, but I could tell they just opened.  (The bar was a tad bit dirty, but promptly cleaned when brought to the bartender's attention) I enjoyed the salad, grilled chicken, fish and fresh cabbage.  The drink menu was bland, but there were plenty of  options as far as drinks went..  The food was extremely fast, so if you like to take your time-order bit ,by bit!  However, you do not get the \""fast-food\"" feeling.  I look forward to more meals at my local Wahoo's.",3
"I definitely had better.  This place is over rated.  Second time I have been here and had the same poor experience.  I felt I was paying more for the location than I was for the food.  The food was okay and the service was poor.  If you ever decide to go eat around west gate I recommend you try the Yard House, they have a great selection of beer and some great lunch and dinner items.",1
"I love sitting in the Tatami Room. It's cozy and comfy.\nWatari Bune 55 \""Ferry Boat\"" Sake - pricey but smooth.\nI love the Late Night Menu!!\n10pm - 2am\nEverything is good!\nThe Philadelphia Roll is my guilty pleasure.\nCajun Crunch is divine chef special\nNabeyaki Udon is a fave.\nSave room for dessert",3
"We had a very disappointing experience today at Over Easy. First of all, the service was lousy, slow and inattentive. We had to remind the waiter twice to bring drinks and once to bring toast that came with my father's meal. The food was equally unremarkable:  I had the cheddar biscuits and gravy and they were bland, barely seasoned and cold. My husband had the famed \""waffle dogs\"" and he said they were \""decent,\"" but that's about it. Our friend had the chicken fried steak and found it lacked seasoning, and the breading was sliding off of the meat. She said the hash browns were the best part of the plate, giving them \""three stars.\"" Overall, we will never come back to Over Easy again due to the service and bland, average food.",1
"if you're going out for pizza go someplace else.  that being said, if you just want to gamble, grab a drink and maybe snack on something, Sammy's is a decent choice.  the pizza is edible but not very memorable.  it was much better in san diego when they first opened.  I do like the caeser salad with chicken.  in fact, their roasted chicken breast is reason enough to go to sammys.  it's full of flavor and juicy with a nice char.  I don't care at all for the Asian and fusion direction they have gone to in recent years.",2
"Next up, there was the Winneburger from the fine folks at Nouveau Palais on Bernard street in Mile End. This old school looking winnebago serves up classic summer BBQ fare - burgers, chips, milkshakes and lemonade. I decided to go for the regular burger and a lemonade to get a sense of their offerings.\n\nThe lemonade was solid - sweet and freshening. Perfect for the hot summer during which it was consumed. The burger came with cheese, onions, lettuce and a tomato. This was a perfectly executed classic burger. The beef patty was nice and juicy without being too messy to eat on the go. The bun had the right level of crunch on the outside with the nice soft interior. All the vegetables were fresh and classic for a burger. This burger is exactly the kind one hopes for when having a nice BBQ back home. Just a classic item done right. Quite nice.",3
"Great atmosphere (aside from the pop music played throughout the restaurant), fantastic tasting food, portions are appropriate and the deserts are great.  Best part is watching the Chef work his magic, not very often you have a chance to watch a world class Chef preparing your meal/dessert.  If you have a craving for quality ramen, this is the place.",3
"This pains me to do, only two stars. I mean it, I like Gus'. Good beer selection, atmosphere, classic arcade game in the back. It is an enjoyable place. I have been there a handful of times and genuinely enjoyed myself. But, it still deserves this review.\n\nGot the Heisenburger, fries and pickles last night with friends. It was equal parts interesting and unappetizing. \n\nThe pickles were, as always, on point. The sauce (buttermilk something or other I think) was pretty weak and a little bland. Otherwise, well done.\n\nThe burger was a failure. Asked for medium and got something north of well done. The peppercorn was more than scorched and the meat itself had the rich color of mortar. At times I enjoyed the interaction the blue cheese had with the caramelized onions, but by and large this was a swing and a miss.\n\nFries were good as always. The aioli was spot on and the salty greasiness of the taters is the stuff of boardwalk dreams . \n\nAll in all, I am being a little hard on Gus'. I think upon further review it deserves a three. Damn those delicious pickles!",2
This is a family run business that is clean and they truly care about customer service. Last time I was in there I had a Ninja Chicken Bowl which seems to be their specialty. It consists of mainly rice with chunks of chicken and A LOT of soy sauce. They owner asked me how I liked it and I said I didn't. So at least they care enough about the customer. But I just can't bring myself to come back. There wasn't another customer during the whole time I was at this place.,1
"Good family restaurant w/gr8 gluten-free menu.  Variety of standard dishes.  I like the shrimp salad, gluten-free pasta, tomato soup, margarita pizza, duck tacos, tapas and drink selection.  The food isn't gourmet but it's well prepared, amble and the service is good.  Prices are decent and the place is spacious.  Menu is always changing.",2
I've been here 5 times now. I recommend Sunday brunch much more than their dinner. Not that their dinner is bad but brunch is better with breakfast and regular food options and you get bottomless mimosas. Soooo who is to complain!? It's a bit pricey but if you like variety that's great. I love the crab legs. You can a stir fry dish made or a build your own pasta. I will say some of the food is bland or might not be as hot as you would like but this is kind of to be expected when going to a buffet and when you know you can do build your own dish options you can get piping hot food too. Also this is one if the only buffets I will even consider eating the sushi. And their sushi is good ! \nGive it a try!,2
"Here's the question you have to ask yourself: how much trouble are you willing to go through for a good (not great) product? The quality of service is really spotty: sometimes good (again, not great) and sometimes horrendous. I dealt with the team in the Chandler Mall for our wedding and no one seemed to know what was going on at any given time. One of my groomsmen was given the wrong suit (similar color, but not the same suit), even though we ordered and paid 3+ months in advance. They're unwilling to fix their mistakes, difficult to get a hold of over the phone and again, all for only decent quality. Furthermore, I disagree with the other reviewer: as far as men's suits go, they're not very knowledgeable about current trends and actually try to push you in the direction of their personal style (in our case, a middle-aged man who probably has pants 4 sizes bigger than our largest groomsman) instead of listening to what you actually want. \n\nIf you are willing to put in the time to call a million times and still possibly end up with the wrong stuff, I urge you to test your patience and go with Nick's. If you want things to go smoothly, I recommend you consider other options.",0

"The only airport I know where people don't look like they're ready to die in the terminals.  Also the only one I know that has $1 machines next to the Cinnabon.  The eternally-closed Cinnabon.   \n\nEasy to park at for short-term, drive-up & drop-off is equally good rather than a 20-minute ordeal.  Fast security lines.",2
went here for brunch and they failed me.  it was overpriced food that tasted like cardboard! they couldnt even make it up in their service department.\n\nFAIL,0
"I love this place...best pizza in Phoenix- hands down! Wings are amazing, service is always phenomenal. I simply love this restaurant. I have to admit that I may be a bit biased as this place holds a lot of sentimental value to me. My family and I have eaten here for years and years. At this point- 4 generations worth, that I know for sure, have dined at and loved Red Devil. My husbands favorite is the sausage and artichoke pizza- while mine is the Red Devil combo. We always split an order of medium wings and get bigger then we know we will eat- pizza so we can have some to bring home. \n\nThis restaurant also does well balancing the \""family friendly\"" with the \""date night\"" crowds. I will say that we live much closer to the Mesa (Tempe?) location and have gone there 4-5 times...completely not the same. Yes, same-ish food, but the other location just simply does not have it like the McDowell one. Dont waste your time at the other one- just go to the McDowell location and enjoy!",4
Super healthy food and very clean restaurant! The bison burger was so good and I did not feel weighted down after eating it. Many veggie and vegan options as well as regular diet to choose from. I am not a fan of jicama but the seasoning on the jicama fries complements it well. I would go back to try to beverages they offer.,3
"A fantastic time.....but to be honest I didn't expect anything less!  Everything was great from the moment I stepped in the door and into Thomas's arms. ;)   \n\nThe concept is great and I'm definitely looking forward to the next FEZ Foodies event.  There is no better way to end your weekend then with good food and wine with friends!\n\nOh, and Erica, you got there too late for the Patron drinks...thats what we warmed up with!",4

"Geee-ross!  The other half and I got take-out for this place.   But first a little back-story....  My dad's whole family worked at a Chinese restaurant in Philly from before I was born until the late 1990's.  My mother says she craved Chinese food the whole time she was pregnant with me and by proxy got me hooked on Chinese in the womb. I bless her for having done so. I love Chinese and could eat it every day...willingly.  I've tried Chinese in every city and country I've ever lived or visited, as I always love to see what's out there and experience the regional variances and interpretations. I can usually find something good, no matter how nasty or base a buffet, or made-to-order.  And Lord knows I love take-out and a movie on the sofa.  Great nite, rite?\n\nA few weeks ago I convinced the better half to go pick up Gourmet House of Hong Kong, if I paid and he drove. Deal. Done.  I ordered on the phone - no problems. It's rite down the street from our house, so dinner was steaming hot and in the living room within 20 minutes.  We queued up the DVD and we're ready to go.\n\nThe fried rice was yummy and OK.  Not the best I've had but not the worst either.  The BBQ pork app was good and I liked the dipping sauce it came with. Everything else was skank.  I'd say avoid the noodles at all costs. They were like nasty over-cooked spaghetti in a watery, flavorless sauce.  Even with soy sauce added, they did nothing for me.  \n\nI'm kind of sad b/c the other reviews on Yelp seemed pretty good.  The place is not that great looking from the outside, and never having been inside, I can't comment on that -- but I would never get take-out from here again.  At least we didn't get sick.  It was just bland-o-rama, which makes me sad.  I even threw-out the leftovers, which has only ever happened  one other time with Chinese take-out, when I left for vacation the next day and didn't want to stink up the fridge.",1
"Food was good BUT the place was so filthy that I lost my appetite. It's an old 5 & diner restaurant, they haven't redecorated one ounce. You can literally scrape the dirt and grime off of the chairs, floor and walls. I can't imagine what the kitchen must look like!",1
"One of my favorite steakhouses to visit in Las Vegas. I have been to Del Frisco's a few times now, and it is always a great experience. This most recent trip for a birthday celebration was really nothing short of great. I even actually opted for seafood this night over red meat.. long week of t-bones and lamb.. haha.. random week.. but anyway. \n\nThe quality of the food is fantastic. The service was spot on without being pretentious or rude, and the overall experience was really pretty wonderful. The staff really made us feel great.. and made every effort to keep our drinks full, bread basket overflowing and meals served promptly. \n\nSeriously, i can say nothing else other than it's also pretty fantastic that they are located off-Strip and thus, requires that you do not have to deal with a huge parking garage. While they have valet available, the parking lot is like 50 feet from the front door if you want to just walk. \n\nI will be back.. again and again.",3
"Fantastic! I have eaten MANY Gyros and this was the best. The fried pita chips with hummus is a brilliant idea! (also good with ketchup) Quality stuff here, clean place, friendly staff. Give it a try!",4
"Yes I give it 5 stars, but DON'T GO.  I want all the amazing things to myself.  You don't want to save money and decorate your home with great finds.  You  don't want to try gourmet food items for half the cost.  Nope you know you DO NOT want to go here.  \n\nThis place is MINE MINE MINE.  : )",4
Being new to the area we decided to give Gordas a try. The whole family was glad we did. I ordered a couple tacos one carne asada and one carnitas. Both were delicious. I especially enjoyed the carnitas but both were delicious. My husband and son both had burritos and after seeing them it left me wishing I had ordered one myself even if they were big (lunch for the next day). My daughter loved the enchilada plate that came with rice and beans. There were many different types of salsa in the salsa bar and the restaurant was clean and well decorated. I only wish we could have enjoyed our meal with a beer. We will definitely be back though the food was that good.,3
"Nickled and Dimed or $15d and $20d - that's before you get to the casino.\n\nHaving stayed at PH in the past, I had decided to return since the other Caesar Ent hotels are worn and tired based on previous stays.  My stay was midweek when occupancy is not as great as the weekend.\n\nThe arrival experience at PH was less than pleasant.  If you self-park, it is quite a trek to registration through the shops, dodging visitors, through the casino and down to the front office.  Having waited in line for 35-40 minutes to check-in, it was my turn to be assisted by one of the five agents.\n\nThe desk agent advised me of the $20 per day resort fee that I would be charge and the inclusion (internet for one device, gym access and LOCAL CALLS).  Free local calls - I guess that benefits those who do not have cell phones?!?\n\nWhile I was aware the recently added resort charge at PH and other Caesar Ent hotels, I was shocked when she asked if I would like to get my keys now for $15 for \""early check-in.\""  Check-in time is 3:00PM and it was 2:40PM.  Seriously?  The room was vacant and ready and check-in time was 20-minutes away.\n\nPH will be happy to know that I paid the fee, plus the tax that was not disclosed at C/I.  There was a line already formed for those there to pick-up their preregistration keys.\n\nIf I would have known in advance of this fee, I may have timed my arrival differently.  Guess I should have read some of the reviews on Yelp before my visit.\n\nThe guests rooms are okay; the rooms are dark with small windows.  The bed/mattress was not comfortable. Even though the minimum bet at the table games is $15 the casino doesn't have an exciting \""vibe\"". The dealers are pleasant and engaging. \n\nOkay, a few pluses - the room was relatively clean, the bathroom is large, there is a separate adult pool, Earl of Sandwiches has good offerings with an efficient system and PH has a good central location on the strip.\n\nWith the addition of the fees, the resorts across the strip are a better value - newer, fresher product with better service.",1
"Loved how this new company took over the old Theater!! To me it still looks the same as buy the tickets outside and then go in to the concession stand. But, when you get your tickets from the box office they show you a screen and you pick your seats!!! We got adult matinee $8.50. Then you go in and they have Alcoholic beverages to the right and the normal popcorn etc on the left.  We got a large popcorn and large drink $13.50.\nWhen you go into the theater OMG.. the seats are amazing. Recliners with using a push button gets you all cozy and a little table for your snacks. The movie screen is huge!! Very clean inside and the Women's bathroom was too!!\nThey have a Galaxy rewards card that you sign up online and pick you card up at the box office and you gain points with each use and get free things and its free to sign up. Very similar to the Regal Cinema card.\nLoved this experience and we will be back.",4
"we ordered togo, there was just us and another couple eating there. we waited 25mins and still no food! i finally went up to the cashier and asked how come our food is not ready yet?!? she looked at me like she didnt take my order and asked for my receipt! she talked to the manager and everyone else.. They forgot to do my order!! i was so pissed i asked for my money back!!! they gave me my refund and also my order for free! so... food was pretty good, a bit salty for my taste, and service was bad! will not go to this one again.",0
"On my first trip to Vegas, years ago, I stayed at the Sahara.  It was on its decline at that point, and during subsequent visits became a hotel-casino that I was certain to avoid.  Even considering that, I was sad to see it close (another piece of old Vegas lost) and had a lot of trepidation about the re-opening as the SLS (or the sodium laurel sulfate, as I think of it).  Can you open a swanky place on the North end of the Strip?  I decided to check it out, thanks to cheap room rates ($43 plus the ubiquitous $25 resort fee) and quick access to the highway (so we could get out to the wilderness without having to brave Strip traffic).  \n\nI don't think you can tell this used to be the Sahara unless you really knew the old property and pay a lot of attention to the layout.  The SLS is modern and feels like a new place even though parts of the place date back to the 1950s.  It amused me to read reviews where people talked about the SLS as a property that was \""just built\"" - but really, it's promising that the place feels so new and not just like a refresh of the tired old Sahara.  Maybe this will help bring new life to the North end of the Strip.  It's on the Monorail, so it's connected to the rest of the Strip without being in the middle of everything.  The restaurants all sound amazing, though we only tried the Griddle Cafe, but it was quite good (but beware - portions are INSANELY large).  \n\nThe room we got in the Story Tower was pretty crazy, and I strongly recommend checking YouTube for a video tour of one of these rooms.  Mirror on the exposed concrete ceiling, bed and sofa frames that light up, sliding mirrored panels to reveal the bathroom, and bright yellow walls.  I really liked the aesthetic and functionality of the reasonably small room, but I can see why some people are sort of taken aback by the boldness of everything.  The room was clean and comfortable, and check-in and check-out were very efficient.  They've got a really nice television system that includes all sorts of communication and information functionality.  And the monkey-themed accents are awesome - I snapped a pic of every one I could find!",4

I requested oil on my veggie omelette.\n4. The home fries are not over-seasoned abominations laying around until they're ready to be scooped. These are simple sliced potatoes. They came out hot, crispy, and topped with fresh chopped peppers and onions if you want them.\n5. The hash browns are crispy and not too greasy.\n6. Everything isn't salty!

"You gotta pay to play in Vegas and it's no different with this place.  But, the bone-in ribeye is well worth it and not much more expensive than other nice steak joints out there.  Wine list was too snobbish ($$$) for my taste but hey if you love how the grape bursts with flavor on your tongue then you will enjoy it.  Waited a bit despite a reservation (why even bother with reservations?!) and was mildly amused by a poor man's Bellagio waterfall show by the entrance.  If you love a juicy steak and have actually made some money gambling, then this is your spot and if you won a lot of money then you might even order one of their wines.",3
"So, my dad took me here today and billed it as an \""upscale Houston's.\""  I think not.\nThis place is a total Houston's rip-off.  Seriously, the decor is the same, the smell when you walk in is the same, the servers' outfits, the menu, the drinks, the silverware - I guess you see the point.\nSo I ask the server, \""are you affiliated with Houston's?\"" \nHe goes off on a story about how the WCG is an original concept and much better than Houston's - yada yada, save it for someone who isn't an aficionado of the Houston's persuasion.\nIf you are going to say all of that, and clearly be a rip-off of my *favorite* restaurant, then you had better live up to the name.  And frankly, they don't.  I had the seared ahi tuna salad with mango and avocado (surprisingly, Houston's has the EXACT SAME SALAD - only better).   It was good, as I was jonesing for some tuna - but I could have done without the heavy sesame crust and the drenching with dressing.  My dad has the rotisserie chicken, and was so disappointed that they ended up taking it off of the bill (it was cold and dry).  We both had fresh-squeezed Arnold Palmer's - and they had ooky sugar-coated rims.  No thanks.\nThe french fries were excellent, yay french fries.  Oh, and surprisingly, you can get them with mustard-honey dressing, just like at Houston's - though again, it wasn't as good.\nYou know, it is probably a 3-star restaurant, but I was so put-off by the whole \""we aren't Houston's and that restaurant sucks\"" attitude - when they are so clearly trying to be Houston's, that I will not ever be back.  If I want Houston's I will get the real thing, and it will taste better.\nPlus, I think the name is super lame.  The service was fine, the place is fine - but just go get the real thing, it is worth the wait.\n\n**UPDATE**\nI upped my star rating to 3 because the GM contacted me and explained a bunch about the restaurant.  I really appreciate such personalized customer service - he certainly didn't have to be so nice.  So, I will try WCG again and hopefully pull the rating up another star!  I still think the name is funny . . .\n\n** ANOTHER UPDATE **\nI was harassed by a fellow \""reviewer\"" of the WCG who was clearly affiliated with the restaurant.  This \""reviewer\"" has no other reviews and is a bit fishy.  I do not appreciate being contacted to argue about the experience I had and this type of activity destroys the integrity of Yelp.  I will not be returning to WCG and neither will anyone I know in AZ (they will all be hearing this story!).  Plus, we like Houston's better, anyway, so this will not be a loss!",0
"Do NOT believe the gimmicks they show you on the tele or commercials.\n\nI went in to purchase an Ipad mini with Retina display.  My first question was, when  I could get the device.  They quoted me they were getting a shipment this week and I could get it by the end of the week or by beginning of next week.  \n\nI had to the misfortune to get a new sales associate who was absolutely clueless.  She kept having to ask everyone else questions and had the manager come over quite a few times but within minutes those managers disappeared only to be called over again.\n\nShe asked me which data plan I wanted.  I didn't want to purchase extra data, just the 200mb they advertised on the tele.\n\nShe went in the back after I told her that I didn't want to purchase extra data, only the device itself with the free 200MB.  She brought back her manager, who told me that he'd give me a month of free upgraded data.  I told him that wasn't necessary but moved forward.\n\nI probably stood around for over 20 mins for her to get the paperwork and have other managers to come look at what she was doing and walk her through things.\n\nI was signing paperwork when I noticed that I had a $15.68 fee.  When I inquired what it was for, she told me it was for \""government fees\"" and that \""the government has to have a piece of the pie too.\""  I didn't question her explanation too much although puzzled.\n\nI got home and looked at the paperwork closer and that $15.68 was for a prorated fee for the supposed free data the manager offered.  I called the store and they said they'd take care of it.  They have a list of who gets free data.  After the girl's explanation, I wasn't convinced and asked them to just take that extra data away.  \n\nWhen my son got home from school, he showed me his mobile showing that a number was added to my line and was suspended.\n\nI called customer service and they informed me I opened a new line...which is beyond me since I already have 2 lines...why would I need another phone line?

"MY THANKSGIVINGS OVER THE PAST 4 YEARS:\n\n2004: Rainforest Cafe, San Francisco, CA (food so overpriced and terrible that I can't even remember what I ate)\n2005: my roommate's family's house, Salinas, CA (spent eating Filipino food on a Saturday, since for some reason they don't celebrate the holiday on the actual day)\n2006: Todai, Las Vegas, NV (Japanese buffet at the now extinct Aladdin Hotel, overthrown by Planet Hollywood)\n2007: Buffet at Treasure Island, Las Vegas, NV\n\nAt first glance, my list makes it seem as if it's been years since I've had a REAL Thanksgiving. Au contraire, this year was as genuine a holiday as ever--surrounded by family, endless rows of food, endless outlet stores on Black Friday, endless betting tables and slots, endless nightlife possibilities... \n\nSeriously, how much more thankful could you be!!\n\nNot to mention, the Buffet at T.I. had an impressive authentic Thanksgiving dinner spread that Thursday evening. I had the teensiest slices of turkey and ham, and the ittiest bit of mashed potatoes. The rest of my plate went to sushi, crab legs and dessert (including a pumpkin donut... was too full for pie).\n\nIf you're staying at the hotel, the buffet is worth checking out. It seemed pretty clean, semi-new, and ok-pleasant (in that brightly lit, gluttonous sort of way).  At $30 a pop, I thought it could have been a little less expensive, especially after we ate at Carnival World Buffet at Rio, a buffet that's 10 times bigger and more popular, for only $22 each. However, this could have been the jacked price just for Thanksgiving. I'm not sure.\n\nBtw, I really am not as thankful for gambling as I made it sound. I actually don't even like gambling. However, FOOD... oh yes. I am thankful. And thankful for the buffet for making food very abundant and accessible.\n\nThank you for buffets!!!",3
"I have only had food here once, and wasn't anything memorable.\n\nBut - if you want to hit up a nice, great ambiance bar with a reverse happy hour before going out. This place is awesome.\nTry their sake Sangrias! I like white vrs red.. but don't be shy. It is great.\nAnd if you are looking for something  a little more manlier... there is always the Sake Bomb!",2
"It's a standard chain, but I'm a CPK faithful. I like the food; it combines Italian American faves and tries to do something different with it. The Kung Pao spaghetti is legit, so good!",3
"The meat is amazing. Sides are kind of hit-or-miss in my opinion. It's got a fun atmosphere & is Always busy.  Very casual but worth a visit. \nI actually prefer their sister restaurant Joe's Farm Grill, which is better all around (& you can get some of the BBQ options there too).",2
"The BF and I went here this morning for breakfast after finding it on yelp. I thought it sounded good and I love trying new places, so we went. The place was busy, we almost left because there were no parking spaces left... luckily we made one more pass and someone was just walking to his car to leave. There was a little bit of a wait, but not bad. So the inside of this place is really cute, with the wood paneling and all. We got a cute little booth. We both ordered coffee, which was very meh. Really watered down coffee and cost 2.25 a cup. For breakfast, I ordered the spanish omelet and the BF got biscuits and gravy. The omelet was really good. It had a kind of spicy sauce on it that was tasty and I added cheddar which really went well with the sauce. The potatoes that it came with were nothing special, no real flavor. It also came with toast which was what it was. That cost 9$. The BF liked his B&G but thought it was a bit salty. It cost around 8$ with bacon. Overall, I'd say the place was good, but not great. For the 27$ I spent after tip, I could have gone to Liberty Market which is much much better, so I probably wouldn't come back here.",2
"As a place to watch sports, I love it! Lots of TVs = non-stop sports action. \n\nIf you want good food, Champs will disappoint. Had the Champs Burger. Dry, overcooked, yuck. Don't.",2
"my boyfriend & I ordered the Steak Frites from the \""sunset menu\"".  Our steak was overcooked, fries were OK.  And, drinks are expensive.  We sat at the bar, but the bartender wasn't that friendly until she gave us the bill.  The restaurant has a nice view of the pool, though.",1
"Horrible, bad don't eat here. Staff doesn't care about service or quality of food",0
"This is supposed to be in the biggest Forever21 . I admit , it was pretty big . However , all the Forever21s I've been to were pretty big . But this one just happened to be a little bigger . Instead of a store , this Forever21 is more like a department store . This Forever21 might be big but it didn't really impress me all that much . They just sell what other Forever21s sell but with a larger inventory .",2

"A hidden treasure!\n\nWe try to make it to this place once a week, a great place for a quick lunch or a nice dinner, often times dinner comes with live jazz.  You will not run out of wine or liquor choices here.\n\nMust try's include:\nCrab Wontons  (Best in town!!!!)\nMost of their dishes are great and can be had with rice or noodles.",4
DD has now taken my business for coffee. I don't go for the doughnuts but for their iced coffee. It is half the price of Starbucks and just as good and their drive thru is even quicker.,4
"Yum.  Been there numerous times.  The menu is extensive - and pricey- but also very good.  Our favorite is to sit at the beautiful bar, have a bottle of wine and order a pizza.  Right.  It's not on the dinner menu, and I think they try to keep it under the radar for fear of becoming a Pizza joint.  But they will make it to your specifications, and it is delish. Manga.",3
"PH towers Westgate was really nice IMO.\nUnfortunately it took forever and a day to get my room but it was definitely worth it in the end. I arrived extremely early due to my flight being crazy early in the morning... so I had to wait many hours, but I couldn't blame them since their check in time IS at 4. Luckily the room was ready by 1PM. We had the TWO BEDROOM SUITE high floors and had 9 people. It fit us all pretty well. I probably wouldn't do more than 10 in the overall suite. What I was a little bummed about is that when I made the reservations WAY IN ADVANCE, I was promised two pullouts.. when we got into the room we only noticed one. I called and they offered me a roll away bed.. that was fine, so we took it.\n\nThe room itself was a really good deal.... especially for the summer.. and the it's pretty spacious and comfty.\n\nThe kitchen came in handy to make ramen noodles and stuff lol, oh and the water from the fridge saved ALL of our lives and our wallets too.\n\nSweet views, comfortable beds and spacious. PH towers is pretty awesome and I wouldn't mind staying here again in the future.",3
"We arrived at Jade on Sunday evening.  The restaurant didn't seem too busy, but we were not greeted by a hostess.  Instead a waiter rushed us to our table.  After getting somewhat settled, one of the waiters brought us glasses of water.  However, the water ended up falling all over the table and us.  Our laps were soaked.  The waiter apologized and changed our table, but that was the only gesture that was made to improve our experience (e.g., no manager was on site to speak with us, we were not offered any complimentary items, we were not compensated for any portion of our meal).  Service for the rest of the dinner was mediocre at best, and while we tried to wait to place our order and to request the check, we had to seek his attention multiple times.\n\nMaybe this was off night but this makes no excuse to have such shoddy service and to not have a system in place to help make the consumer's experience more enjoyable.  As a side note, I thought the food was decent (3.5 stars), but I would never come back.",0
"Came into town from Boston to visit my dad...did my research & found this place for my stiletto nails. CHRISTY was amazing...took such good care of me...my nails were perfect and I had a great time there. Ill be back. Management was kind and professional, prices were amazing...luv luv luv",4
It's good! We didn't really like the chili cheese dogs but loved the Chicago dogs. The have no jalape\u00f1os here and that is important to me on a good hot dog. Or at least having the option.,2
Had the blackened Mahi Mahi tacos - Yum!  Was nice to have a tasty option to fried fish tacos.  Will def be coming back :),3
"Tucked away on the strip in the Hawaiian Marketplace area, this is a hidden gem.  So I'll admit it was my first time having Indian food.  Luckily I was meeting friends who had some knowledge about it and helped me out on what to have.  We went 'family style' so we were able to taste a little bit of everything we ordered.  \n\nFirst I want to say the service and staff here were amazing.  My water glass never went less than half full.  Kudos! Our waiter was very helpful also in helping us decide what to get.  I would say he went above and beyond! \n\nTo start off, we tried the Vegetable Samosa's and Vegetable Pakora's.  The Samosa's reminded me of an empanada except stuffed with potato and peas.  Accompanied with the sauces, these were great! The Pakora's were good also but a little too much breading.  For the main course, we went with the Chicken Tikka Masala.  The tomato curry sauce over the chicken was good! I scooped this over the basmati rice and was very pleased.   As for the chicken and rice dishes, there was plenty to be shared between 3 people and couldn't imagine eating this all myself. We even had much leftover! The garlic naan came out warm, flavorful and perfect.  \n\nOverall I was delighted for this to be my first Indian food experience.",3
"When it comes to shopping, I avoid going to this place at all costs.  Parking almost always sucks, and I guess I don't frequent it enough to know which end to park on to get to the one store I need to visit.  On my most recent visit, I tried using the interactive directory to help me find my way, and it was a miserable failure.  Yeah, it's very cool that it shows your little footprints walking from your current location to your destination, but it doesn't have anything labeled on the rest of the map to give you any sort of point of reference as to which way you should go.  Good idea in theory.  Maybe the next model will be better.  \n\nThey have a lot of the standard chain sit down restaurants and some standard mall food court type of places but I'm generally not a fan of those so I've never eaten there.\n\nThe only thing that earns this place an additional star is the little splash pad they have for kids.  I've brought my stepdaughter here numerous times to play and look forward to bringing our little one this summer.",1
Been coming for a few years and always AAA service and 5 star quality Barbering skills!,4
They were so nice and attentive and even bought us dessert after a little snafu that was obviously not their fault. Food an service was amazing,3
"Lots of hype, Everyone in this city is recommending this place and when you get there, there are hipsters lined down the street to get in, there is more bryl cream and dark rimmed glasses in here than a Buddy Holly look-a-like contest. Once you get over that you could be liking this place ironically and get down to it, the food is pretty good. \n\nIt is a great place for lunch but the portions are too small for supper. What it does lack in quantity it makes up in quality. the mac and cheese doesn't really taste like mac and cheese it tastes like deep fried cubes that may or may not contain cheese or macaroni elbows. But come on, you are going here for the meat, its great, I ordered the brisket and also the turkey, both were just outstanding. \n\nAlthough I found the portions to be too small they do offer a $35 plate, jury is still out as to whether or not this is a one person entr\u00e9e or two, I will find out on my next visit. \n\nI would definitely recommend getting it to go, unless of course you are enjoying it ironically, then stay and share a picnic table with other people possibly enjoying the food because it is delicious or because it is the new hip spot to be enjoyed by a hipster. Its too small for sitting inside even waiting for your food to go I got crashed into like crazy by people. its pretty cramped. Hopefully sales stay up and they can move to a larger location. \n\nI would for sure recommend, its clean, quaint, and above average quality.",2
"This is by far the best Starbucks I've been to in Vegas customer service wise. I've never had a problem with any of my orders and believe me I stop by often since it is so close to work. The baristas are super friendly and as difficult I am on my drinks (add this, extra this....) they never seem to complain or miss a beat. I love the fact that they always repeat the order to make sure it is correct.",4
"Not the best experience. Elevators slow and too crowded. Walls paper thin, so very noisy. My sister stayed there too and was kept up all night by crying baby. Parking lot and parking structure shared with UPMC medical facility and okay on weekend but Monday morning a total zoo. For this they charge a high fee for Pittsburgh. Room itself was clean and comfortable.",1
"Best service in town, maybe in the world.  This newly blossoming empire around town also serves up the ultimate hangover cure, especially when complimented by a Propel.  Store that fact away, it's a useful one.",3
Really dry sandwiches. Slow service. Every Milio's I've been to has been 4x better than this. Just bad.,0
"I rented an SUV for 3 days and was quoted 312.76, upon return of the vehicle today I was told I owed 485.12 and asked why?  The young lady asked if I took out insurance and I told her no; I have my own coverage.  The young lady said I was charged for insurance and they would have to investigate further and would get back with me, which I firmly responded I want this resolved now.  Since I didn't  have my original contract with me she had to look it up, which she did and found I did not take out insurance and the price of 312.76 was correct even though their computers said something different.  As she was finalizing my invoice I made a comment \""If I had not said anything I would have been charged for insurance an additional 100.00 plus dollars.  Now here is where the stars start fading....the manager Douglas who was helping another client was obviously tuned in to what was going on and asked the young lady to trade clients so he could finish with me.  He then proceeded to spout.....\""I heard what you said, and are you implying we would charge you for something you did not request, we are not that kind of company and would never do that.\""  My response was if I had paid it and not challenged the charge you most definitely would have taken the money end of story.  After a few minutes of disbelief how Douglas the manager was bantering and being cocky to \""me\"" the customer; I told  him to \""shush\"" and stop talking, he was making this situation worse.  His response was to mock me...very professional for a manager!  Had he simply said I am sorry about the mistake I would not be sitting here writing this negative review.  \n\nOh and just for the record...when I picked up the vehicle it had less than an 1/8 tank of gas; I was to be compensated for the difference when it was returned but was not.  This was my first experience with Enterprise and even though it is very convenient with a manager like Douglas who went out of his way to make this issue worse, I can't say I will be back or refer clients/friends to this location.",0
"Seems always the last thing we have in our stomachs before with leave the city of sin is the Korean Beef Tang Soup from Kimchi. Located at the end of the strip past encore we've shown up at 7 in the morning after a hard night's work.\n\nIt is by no means cheap eats but when you need something comforting and need to skip that burger the soup will satisfy your sinful soul, and help soak up some of that alcohol\n\nThey even have a \""taxi\"" (some guy with a minivan) if you need to get home, but i think it only works if you can speak korean.",3
Excellent food and service.  A great place to go for lunch if you are downtown.  I have yet to have a bad meal here.  The burgers are great and the lab kriska is yummy!,3
I had the worst pastrami sandwich in my life. It was like pastrami jerky and bread was hard. I will not go back.,0

"Went with a friend she had bought an Amazon deal so she wanted to use the voucher. I wouldn't came back even if I had a voucher.

"1 Star for location and price, 1 because my Kamikaze roll was \""ok\"". \n\nThere was no one at the door, so I had to sneak back to ask if I could seat myself although it didn't look inviting. I had called to ask I wifi was available, answer was yes, but unfortunately this didn't exist. Salmon sashimi was extremely thick cut. Miso soup came out in a bowl that was very cold; not the soup, the bowl. It had been refrigerated or something. Soup lasted 30 secs.",1
"Iron worthy, though if  I had known that Old Town Whiskey has the same burger as Philadelphia's Village Whiskey I might not have given Distrito a chance. It was good, creative and quite different. \n  My Paloma drink came in 3 parts, grapefruit soda, tall glass of ice and a salted highball with tequila. I wasn't quite sure how to consume it, there were no accompanied instructions. The duck fundido was nice, huge and greasy beyond compare, but I like that. The truffle Haurache flat bread was good and the corn and cilantro sprouts made it. I fear the description of corn smut on the menu may not make it a top seller.",3
We love this place! Happy hour twice a day and it's open late night! We always sit at the bar because we love the bartenders! Marcus and Tomas are awesome! Ask Tomas for his famous lemongrass Siracha shot (sounds weird but they're soooo good). Oysters are $1 each during happy hour too.. Great beer selection and amazing service!,4
OMG...the food is 99% American and 1% Jamaican!  I was very disappointed.  The food lacked flavor and they served very large portions. I will most likely not be returning.,1
"We live right around the corner and eat here often.  The  garlic parm wings are great, burgers and sliders are always yummy, and they have pretzel buns!!   They have great drink specials and tons of stuff on tap portions are large and I always bring home extras.   Some of the wait staff is sometimes not all with it but others are awesome!",3
"I have been in Brookline for a year and consider this to be one of the jewels of the neighborhood.\nI visited in May 2014 for dinner with a friend.  He had veal parm.  It came stand alone and the pasta on the side at cost.  I had the old tried and true spaghetti and meatballs.\n\nThe veal was excellent.  Breaded ever so lightly, fried gently. Very flavorful.  The meatballs, delicious.  The spaghetti sauce, sweet and incredibly flavorful.  We both had the wedding soup, and my only regret was that I didn't order a bowl.  Broth, escarole, carrot, meat....a classic done superbly well.\n\nWe each had an alcohol drink, one wine, one beer.\nBill came to about $15 for the both.  \n\nGreat food and at an affordable price.  Ill be back.  \n\nThe dining room is behind the bar.  Food can be eaten in the bar, but not my scene.  The doing room is basically 10 tables around 2 pool tables.  No atmosphere but in classic Italian tradition its a no frills room to eat a meal filled with goodness.\n\nFour stars -- food is great, service wonderful, prices are excellent. Dining room with two pool tables, yuk.",3
"The restaurant was Ok, nothing really to write home about especially when you figure in the pricing of it. The fact that I think a grocery store soup and salad at a Whole Foods is better. Thats just the deal.",2
"Adult computer classes, children's programing, movies, CD's, books!   Free.  What's not to like.  Staff is helpful and usually a pretty quite place.  They do sometimes have programs that spill out into library but have to love the community participating so a little noise isn't going to hurt anyone.",4
"read some of the mixed reviews. over all the food was good. customer service was good. there was a good selection of side dishes other than the typical kimchee and bean sprouts. there were fried marinated baby shrimp, picked cucumber, pickled radish, and a few others i dont remember. i had the beef tofu and it was standard. lots of tofu and good amount of beef. it had just the right amount of spiciness for me.  im sensitive to msg and read a previous review about the questionable use of msg. i know most korean restaurants use msg unless the restaurant states on the menu or in the restaurant that it does not use msg. all i have to say is i have typical light symptoms of msg for me. thirst and lethargic. \n\nif you dont want people to question the use of msg and you dont use it, post a sign or somewhere on the menu that states you dont use msg. sometimes a lot of salt and oils from the food can give someone with a sensitive stomach the same symptoms.",2
"Back to their old tricks. \n\nOn my last two trips, the A/C was not working in either room. As a matter of fact, I only have ever stayed in the \""Select\"" rooms, so these are allegedly the renovated ones. After waiting in line 30+ minutes after 9pm to Check In, I was horrified that my room was the one on the end, next to the vending and ice machine (this is my first stay actually having seen these machines they are so hidden). Anyway, No. The room looked great and the A/C worked and it looked clean except the last filthy low life smoked illegal narcotics in the room. Yep. The drug of choice for low lifes: marijuana. Guess what? I'm allergic!  My allergies were ruined for 2 days all because of that.  So I had to march all the way down back to the lobby, wait in line again, and had the very nasty Greek lady tell me I should take a non smoking room otherwise they would not switch me again...oh yes they would I stay here every month..\n\nAnyway, the new room did not smell but *everything* that was not bolted down was stolen. No Ash Tray, No Cups, No Bible (and yes I read it especially in Las Vegas). The A/C in the room hardly worked at all, the hallway was cooler. I noticed the floor looked dirty and what initially appeared to be rust around the base of the plastic bath tub. I put 2 and 2 together pretty quickly and figured out that housekeeping did a lousy job or the toilet was simply left overflowed for a few days and never cleaned up hence the stains. \n\nIDC if the rooms are either free or next to free but I may just start paying to stay where I play when they don't comp me. I was just here for a job interview that was a complete waste of my time.",1
"My room was nice, they did a great job with the upgrades. I compared a couple other rooms and I can tell that the higher level rooms are nicer than the lower levels. Bed is huge and comfy. I like the flat screen tv's, especially seeing the one in the bathroom. I was told that the upgrades were just done, so I stayed her at the right time. Sadly the pool and jacuzzi were being worked on. If you wanted jacuzzi time, the front desk staff told us to use Ceasar's.  Now that sucks! The casino it self, is very old and nothing like the newer casinos, obviously. would I stay here again, sure the price was right.",3
"I liked this place. We thought it would be dark, but it is quite open and light. Very friendly staff and we enjoyed talking to the bartender, Dan, who was very knowledgeable. Then one downside was the beer selection. The Imperial IPA was our favorite, but it's not a traditional IPA. It's very citrusy without much hop bitterness. The stout was a bit watery. Just lacked body, and I would say the same about the Brown we tried. I hope this place makes it, but they need to keep working on their beers and maybe offer some quest taps as well.",2
"Uniburger is a good Montr\u00e9al burger joint, well deserving its 4 stars. The bulk of those stars, however, come from the abundant and delicious fries rather than the burger itself.\n\nThe burger was good, I am not denying this, HOWEVER, since moving to New York I've had my share of good burgers. Theirs was reminiscent of a lesser Shake Shack burger: it had the same feel, the same basic taste for all basic ingredients (beef patty, tomatoes, lettuce...) but it lacked the delicious Shack sauce which brings it all together and elevates the whole burger.\n\nStill, the whole was very enjoyable - I would definitively recommend it as a spot when rolling through town.",3
"I was looking online for a place to get some gun safety/shooting lessons. This company was very local to me so I checked their website. http://www.arizonatacticalfirearms.com/index.html\n\nThe very first thing that I saw was a young woman, with a tight little shirt, holding a machine gun with a come-hither look. \n\nBased on this and the \""ATF Girls\"" section (girls in tight shirts, breasts peeking out the bottoms,  all holding guns and posing for the camera), I was not inclined to go to these people for lessons. I'm looking for a professional place that will treat me (a woman) as a customer, not a good-ole-boys club with titty pictures on the walls. I'm not a prude, but this place lacked any professional credentials once I hit their home page.  Too bad there is no \""contact\"" link so that I can kindly inform these people of the impression they are making on potential female customers.",0
"Ok...so, it's difficult to give this a star rating as I had a mixed experience. The caesar salad is one of the BEST I have ever had, but the pizza is one, if not the worst I have ever had. I ordered the margarita, sauce, cheese and basil. Well I think they may have run out of cheese and basil. It was a wet tasteless mess. I may return if craving a good caesar.",1
"I'm comparing this Chili's to the one on Shea in Scottsdale.  This was a Sunday at about #:30-ish.  There was no wait although the room was packed.  Our server was quick, pleasant, and as a long time ago server myself, hit all the required steps with perfect timing and a smile.  I always stick to my favorite dish, the Triple Dipper.  I'm crazy about chicken crispers, so they were two of my choices, with the third being southwestern eggrolls.  I've had this at least 6 times before at other Chili's.  The bad news was one bite of the egg roll sent me into spasms of choking and coughing and left my throat burning.  Someone went to town with the cayenne pepper or hot peppers.  I tried it again at the end of the meal and it again set my mouth on fire.  There has always been a little kick to these but NEVER enough to choke me and burn afterward.  The chicken crispers were surprisingly disappointing.  They were not burned or dry, but were far from fresh.  All the other times I've had them there has been a loud crunch at the first bite of freshly cooked coating, then the juices surround my mouth with butter soft delectable chicken.  Even drowning them in the ranch dressing didn't help.  They were edible, but not noteworthy.  Probably what you would get from a pouch of frozen breaded chicken once it had been dipped in the deep fryer basket again to serve hot.  This is not the usual Chili's experience, so I can't blame the chain.  But I blame the manager for caring more about filling seats than the quality of the food.  I'll stick to my beloved Scottsdale Chili's on Shea where I've never been disappointed, even once.",1
"To me, the Bellagio's buffet is the piece de resistance of buffets.  Everything you could ask for -- prime rib, shrimp, crab legs -- nicely laid out and easy to access and locate.  And attentive service.\n\nIt's the priciest of the strip buffets, so be prepared.  And it's even more on a holiday.  Come hungry.",4
"This place is a total hole in the wall, but it is hands down the best Mexican food I've ever had, and I've tried a lot of different places. I love the fish taco combo plate the best, but the fish burrito is also great. Other awesome choices are the rolled tacos, pastor tacos, cheese enchiladas and steak quesadilla. Everything is wonderful!",4
"I went there on a Saturday night with two friends and experienced a drunk football fan seating at our table and calling us \""a**holes\"" all night. The bouncer spotted him but was probably too busy doing nothing and didn't lift a finger.\n\nOtherwise we had a nice chat with a few other local customers, but this \""event\"" kinda ruined our evening there.",1
"XS stands for Xs-ive asians.  \n\nWe were supposed to talk with the main manager at the podium to get in but the stupid rent-a-jerks in their yellow (or purple coats) wouldn't even let us get to him (\""move along, can't block the walkway\"").   We eventually had to yell as we were walking back and forth past the podium like freaking chickens with our heads cut off, we were able to get a host to help us, but the stupid line-patrol rushed us along.  \n\n What a poorly run bunch of security to put a damper on the night, they obviously do not want to cater to a higher clientele who were in search of a good time, just a clientele that can wait in line and have everyone in the party chip in $200 (which is a miracle in itself) and sit at their table and stare at their bottles.  We had our in to the club and after taking a second look at the crowd, we were over it and decided not to go (a few from our party did go in, never heard much as far a details).  But I'm not going to go through a damn horse and pony show just to have a good time. There's a professional and classy way to do things and the way the front of house was run, it was very stand-off-ish.  \n\nI'm not going back here until they get some diversity.  Maybe it was a bad weekend but others tell me its just basically an asian club of people from SoCal trying to be in the \""hot spot\"" and \""poppin bottles\"".",0
"I went in here tonight with the BF. It was weird because I saw a girl I went to HS with, so that was kind of nice (if you're reading this, sorry for the not so great review... nothing to do with you). Anyway, the reason for the low stars is the coffee. I got a latte and it just wasn't that good. It was kind of watery and didn't really have any of that 'latte like' texture. It also didn't have a ton of flavor. The grande was really big, kind of expensive though. The place looked nice enough and they had a band playing, so that was kind of nice. I just wouldn't feel the need to drop 4$ on not very good coffee again. Try Cartel.... they have awesome coffee.",1
"Heaven, I have seen thee and thy name is SAS Fabrics by the Pound.\n\nWhy do I need green, faux mink fur right as the weather begins to warm up?  I dunno, but damned if I'm going to leave it here and hope to find it next fall.  I'll find something to make and some way to sport it if it kills me.  \n\nWhat I DO know though (well, now I know, anyway) is that it's not superduper smart to go to SAS without an honest to god pattern that you're ready to cut and sew in your hand.  There are just too many luxurious fabrics in beautiful prints and colors to play with, every aisle you walk down.  Sure, there's some junky stuff, but whatevs, just keep going and before you know it you're fingering the prettiest, shiniest, brightest silk or brocade or taffeta that you've ever seen, and you're imagining the ballgown that you'll make out of it.  Hey, one never knows when one will need a ballgown, so get off my nuts!  And just in case you do, there's plenty tiaras and whatnot to complete the look.\n\nThey do carry lots of notions, some too many and some not enough. There are BINS of loose buttons, if you care to sort through and find all the matching buttons you need.   I don't think I saw a really great selection of laces and ribbons and other trims though.  The thread is super cheap, but the color selection is a little thin and I'm not sure if it's any good (most of them had \""family dollar\"" stamped on them, and at .20 a pop, who knows).  Needle selection is next to nil, and the ones that they did supposedly have were almost all sold out.  Other helpers, like fusible bonding and stuff are probably pricier than you'd pay somewhere else.  And of course, there are no patterns at all.  Long story short, go to Joann or something for your patterns, SAS for the fabric, and then back to Joann for your notions.  \n\nAnd DON'T BUY THE GREEN FAUX MINK FUR, unless you plan on checking with me every time you leave the house in it, lest we see each other out.  How gauche!",3

"I didn't plan on coming here but I needed to eat something quick since I was already at the Aria. Don't wanna drink on an empty stomach, yannoe? \nThis place is way too big to be considered as a cafe. It's a pretty high end cafe. Too big, Too overwhelming and it was pretty dead on a Saturday evening. Service was pretty slow, but the staff is very friendly. So, I'll give them that one. \nI ordered the Rigatoni Pasta. Wasn't worth $20. Tasted like.. Chef Boyardee or something. They gave out complimentary breads.. cold and a little stale? Oh well, they are complimentary for a reason I guess but I do like a good bread to munch on. Wouldn't come back here again.",1
"I was in Vegas for my bachelorette party, and I knew I had to visit the Christian Louboutin store to treat myself.  I tried to justify buying shoes in Vegas by saying...\""the sales tax is cheaper than California.\""\n\nI had a wonderful sales associate, Linda, helping me out.  I picked out a few shoes, but alas, my size was very popular, and many styles were not available in the store.  I was determined to walk out of the store with a pair of shoes, and Linda was very patient and kept bringing out shoes for me to try on. I finally found a shoe that was in stock, and that I loved!  I ended up with the 100mm black patent leather Decoltissimo!!\n\nIf you are looking to buy some Loutoutins, definitely stop by this store in the Palazzo for great service!",4
"The only drawback to this hotel - it's not on the strip.  Otherwise, I LOVED it.\n\nThe Palms Place is completely remodeled.  You feel like you're walking into a W hotel or something of the like.  It's sleek, modern and hip.  The rooms are suites - they have a ton of windows, full kitchens and large bathrooms (with big tubs).  The beds are so comfortable and there are even 2 TV's in the room.\n\nThe Palm Place is connected to the Palms by a skywalk.  It's a 60 second walk to all the restaurants and casino in the Palms but, there is not a casino in the Palms Place.  I loved that fact because you felt like you were in a little oasis away from the craziness, over-stimulated world of the casino. But a 60 second walk and you were there.  \n\nThe restaurants in both the Palms Place and the Palms were fabulous.  In fact, you really didn't need to leave the hotel but a cab ride to the strip is just a few bucks.  The gym and spa were beautiful and had all the equipment you could ever need.\n\nI would DEFINITELY stay at the Palms Place again.",4
"I want to bring everyone i know here forever in my life!Ilove it here,the food is amazing!!!!This place is awsome! I love the cheeseburger,thanks...",4
"I have been going to this place for years.  It has excellent sushi and a pretty good selection, however often they don't have all the options listed on the menu.  I'm a big fan of white tuna and they never have it.  It's a little pricey, but the quality of ingredient is excellent.  I've had two issues with this place over the 30 or so times I've been here, so that's pretty good.  Try some of the specials.  If you order razor clams if they are on special be careful, because last time I had it there was a ton of sand in the clams.  This is also one of the few spots were you can get a good meal after midnight.",2
"There's not much I can say about Serendipity 3 that hasn't already been voiced in the 900+ reviews. It's a popular stop for tourists because it literally sits right on the Strip and is easily accessed by foot. I could spend hours talking about how much I hate the set up of Caesar's Palace, but I won't. Bottom line, when visiting Serendipity, park valet or else you will earn the calories you eat hiking not only through Caesar's but then following the breadcrumb trail to Serendipity outside.\n\nThere is always a wait, particularly on date nights (Fri/Sat) and if you're not interested in dining in there's a walk-up counter where you can order to-go. It's not their full menu, but has their staple items. The wait is long, but you can get some great people watching in.\n\nI'm not big on sweets, so their signature frozen hot chocolate was never a highlight for me although it is yummy and when spiked packs a dangerously delicious punch! However it was a little to sweet for me and true to the Serendipity theme of heart-stopping portion sizes. In a nutshell, it's instant diabetes, but likely worth it if you have a sweet tooth.\n\nMy favorite at Serendipity is the Caesar salad which I believe comes in two sizes: appetizer and King Kong. I was having as dinner so I got the larger size and wasn't able to finish it and I blame that partly on the amazing croutons that the salad is \""garnished\"" with. Usually, croutons do just serve as a garnish, sitting humbly on top of a salad and delicately scattered throughout. On the Serendipity Caesar, the croutons take the main stage as they are not only enormous but the best damn croutons I've ever eaten. I can't even believe I just spent three minutes writing about them, but they are that good! They're buttery, garlicky and toasty (perfect combo!) on the outside and soft and chewy on the inside and I can't put my finger on what kind of bread they used as I've tried to replicate them at home and they never turn out like this. The dressing was perfect, and evenly distributed throughout the salad. Towards the end things got a little soggy as I tried to power through and not fall face first in food coma into the plate, but any salad will start to do that if it sits there long enough.\n\nThe staff and service is for the most part forgettable. The couple times I've been the staff has either been neglectful or incompetent with attitude which I guess is expected of a place that more often than not deals with walk-ins off the Strip who have been grossly over-served and are now trying to order a sandwich while belligerently drunk.\n\nYes, prices border on the outrageous, but the restaurant is on prime real estate and again, the place has no sense of portion control. All in all, a nice place to take hungry out of town friends.",2
"3.5 Stars. Came here for restaurant week and everything was pretty good!\n\nGot the Cola and pineapple soy braised short rib with jalape\u00f1o creamed corn, Chipotle Cheddar Mashed Potatoes, and the taco appetizer. Didn't like the tacos, but I tried my fiance's empanadas and I wished I had ordered that. The shortrib was very tender and flavorful I would totally order this again, as well as the side dishes. My fiance ordered the ribeye, it was yummy was cooked perfectly. Everything was delicious but very heavy and buttery so I could only eat 1/4 of my dish before I got full and a little sick lol. I tried my friends green beans too, very tasty even thought it was just green beans. \n\nWe all alternated and got the red and white sangria, both were tasty but the red was definitely stronger. I was really looking forward to the horchata bread pudding and was really disappointed. I was expecting a cinnamon explosion but I couldn't really taste the \""horchata\"" in it and it was more of a bread than bread pudding... it was super dense and not very moist. Maybe they were having an off day? I did however try my fiances kahlua creme brulee and it was delicious. Make sure to order this for dessert!\n\nThe restaurant itself is kind of in a random residential area, the indoor part is small but the outdoor patio is spacious. We came wiht a big group for restaurant week so we had to sit outside. It's a little awkward though because the restaurant is surrounded by other buildings, including a kid's dance studio. So we had kiddos dancing and watching us while we stuffed our faces...yeah it sort of killed the ambiance. There was a live singer there though so that was nice touch. \n\nI'll probably be back to try more items on the menu, but we will sit inside this time!",2
"I have been dreaming of you. Oh Boston Market, since I have moved south, I have been looking back on our past with such fond memories.\n\nI sometimes cry knowing we are so far away from each other... and oh how I long for your tender turkey breast.  Cornbread that just melts in your mouth, and even the vegetables are from some other planet of awesomeness.\n\nMC Burger Taco Box just isn't doing it for me anymore. Last night, in a desperate act of \""preparing dinner\"" avoidance, the family loaded up and headed over to a slightly mediocre eating establishment *cough*pandaexpress*cough* and not only were we hurried through the maze of fried, sauteed, and mono-saturated, we were yelled at by probably the smallest woman I have ever seen. There was no warm smiles, rotisserie chicken, or green bean casserole.  \n\nI love you Boston Market, please move to Laveen, before I am battered and deep fried.\n~2",3
Pho is $2+ more expensive than OC. C- for service even though the food came out in a decent amount of time. My pho ga was bland 2/5. Hey at least I didn't get any food poisoning...knock on wood.,1
"Great poker room, entitled poker dealers, Meh service, Meh food that is severely overpriced,",1
Just an Overrated breakfast spot in Vegas.\n\nThey seem to focus more on presentation than flavor. The portions are big but the flavors are way off. \n\nPositive:\n\n*The presentation looked great.\n\n*Big portions for the price.\n\nNegative: The taste \n\n*There was nothing special about the waffles even with the bacon inside. Just Tasted bland.\n\n*The chicken breast had no flavor. Seemed like they focused on the crust and forgot to season the chicken.  \n\n*The scrambled eggs tasted funny. How do you mess up on scramble eggs?  The eggs Tasted very generic...it's  like they added some type of filling to make it seem more. \nMe and my friend both looked at each other with disappointment after tasting it.\n\nI should have Go Go gadget my ass out of there when I had the chance!,0
"This was the worst Mexican food I've ever had!! First off ordered a margarita came to the table looking very weak and it tasted even worse I had to send it back! I decided to just go with a draft beer which is very hard to screw up. They give you free chips with salsa the salsa was nothing special either no kick, then came the enchiladas I ordered one word Terrible too much cheese on top, shredded chicken with no flavor inside and not one decimal of spice! The service was slow and prices were way too high for this place! The only thing positive I have to say is the cervaza was cold",0
"I went here for dinner and it was a huge disappointment. It was mostly fried food and not too much to rave about. The middle eastern section did have a good lamb dish but honestly, I would not go again. They had snow crab legs but nothing except the middle east section was memorable. The whole place had mostly fried food. The desserts were also very mediocre. I should have done a lap around beforehand. You are also in the basement of the hotel, not casino level or up a flight.",1
"Had an excellent pizza here - the Kosmic Karma, which has sun-dried tomatoes, spinach, roma tomatoes,and pesto in addition to the red sauce, and we added meatballs to it. The quality of the ingredients and especially the flavor of the crust were excellent, and there is an extensive tap-beer selection and full bar. But I had to dock a star for the prices - like almost everyone else on this site, I feel that they're charging probably about $5 more than they should for the size of the pizza you're getting. We sat in the bar area and had excellent service, but our server did alert us to the fact that the pizzas take about 20 minutes to get to you.",2
"I've never been a huge fan of Hard Rock Cafes, and kind of despise the idea of going from Cafe to Cafe to collect T-shirts that advertise for their business, but this place literally rocks!  First, upon stepping inside, there are about six screens which show Hard Rock Cafes in different cities of the world, live, allowing us to really watch what is happening in each of these venues, thousands of miles away.  I spent a few moments to watch diners in Beijing!  We went for drinks and for lunch, and while we were making our way to the bar/restaurant on the second floor, we spent time admiring outfitsworn by different pop icons which were diplayed in glass cases throughout. We also amused ourselves with the various interactive screens with music videos and interviews.  Once we sat down, we ordered tequila shots and some drinks.  They had the tequila we wanted and I had a really great mojito.  The food is the typical fare of Hard Rock Cafe...bar food, and some salads....I did, however, really enjoy my chicken salad.  Our server was super friendly and told us that they have live music on the third level every night and a DJ one night.  He then brought passes to get in without paying cover.  After that, we scored some rodeo gear from the Coors Girls, as the rodeo was passing though town and a cowboy was signing autographs. After lunch, we went to the balcony to check out the view, which overlooks the strip, across from the Monte Carlo.  Then, we went upstairs to check out the music club, though it was not open yet, as it was lunchtime.  The third level has an impressive circular bar and a full stage that reminds me of the House of Blues.  I cannot wait to go back and check out a show one night.",4
Maybe I had a too much expectation..\n\nPROs:\n- they invite top DJs\n- big lounge outside\n- nice interior display\n\nCONS:\n- smallass dancefloor\n- hence it gets ridiculously crowded especially when the top DJs are playing\n- people pushing and pouring drinks on each other\n- pricey drinks... $14!!\n- $8 for a bottle of water.... \n\nPS:\n- prepare yourself to walk up 2-3 floors to get there!\n- buy presale ticket to avoid line\n\n\nFYI I came here last week for Dash Berlin. For some reason he arrived at 1:30am and I thought that was a bit of a wait although I enjoyed Rebecca & Fiona's set.,2
"Went here for lunch with a friend.  I ordered the Nachos with no meat.  It was a pretty large serving and came topped with Cheese, Beans, Sour Cream, Guacamole, Salsa, Rice.\n\nI was surprised that they put rice on their Nachos.  I've never eaten Nachos with rice before.  It was not too bad.  I thought the rice was bland and didn't add to the flavor, but it gave an interesting texture to it.  I requested the spiciest salsa they had but it wasn't that spicy at all....I guess they make it for most Gringos.  I thought the Pinto beans were ok, but could have used a little more flavor.  The chips were not home made but were of good quality.  Overall, not bad.\n\nMy friend had a Barbacoa Pork Burrito....the portion was huge!  He liked it alot.\n\nOne cool thing they had was a large selection of Hot Sauce.  I tried a few of the really spicy ones and they packed some punch.  I'm curious about their burritos & tacos and will try them if I eat there again.\n\nWill I return?  At some point, probably....but it's not my 1st or 2nd choice.",2
"Whenever we come here, we are usually never disappointed. The sauce is amazing. I wouldn't be eating seafood if their sauce wasn't included. The crab legs and live Louisiana crawfish are the best items on their list. The price is surprisingly not that bad either. We ordered a pound of shrimp and a pound of crawfish with a bowl of rice and paid 27 bucks. The crab and lobster are obviously more expensive but even then its worth it. Hot N Juicy medium sauce is the perfect heat and flavor. There are other sauces but Hot N Juicy sauce is a combination of all sauces and just has a much better flavor than competitors sauce such as Boiling Crab. Parking is a bit on the downside but they have 2 other locations in vegas with more leg room and car room if you prefer more space.",4
"A coworker went here and raved about the lamb, so I had to try it. I must not have had the same lamb because I ate about half out of hunger and then when the waitress asked if I wanted the rest boxed up I said no and she made this face: :-(\n\nThe atmosphere inside was very strange to me as well. It was a very large ornate space with large tables/booths yet it still felt cheap. The live band in the other room I had to climb over on my way to the bathroom was an interesting touch, but again I couldn't tell if it was fancy or cheap. It kinda reminded me of Vegas in that way.",1
"It would be nice to try this place but I the 3 of us drove all the way there  and it was closed, but the business hours in yelp say they are open 3pm to 9pm.\nIt's just very irritating to get there and find out they are closed. Thanks a lot!!!",0
"Had to come here to get a Banh mi fix when Le's sandwiches closed up early cause they sold out of everything. \n\nPretty sketchy place. Some weird happenings going on in the back room. Maybe gambling, maybe something else. Who knows. People are smoking inside as this place also sells smokes on the side. As for the Banh mi, they aren't anything special in fact they are pretty skimpy on the meat and veggies. Pretty small in comparison to Le's Sandwiches not too far away and more expensive. Probably would never come back here. \n\nAs a side note the place next door has some really weird old Vietnamese ladies singing their karaoke.",0
"So this place is right next to my office and it's becoming a habit of mine!  Breakfast is AWESOME, seriously, awesome.  Any breakfast sandwich - put that in your mouth.  And for those folks NOT nursing a hangover, the oatmeal (loaded with pecans, brown sugar and fresh fruit) is to die for!  nom nom nom.\n\nAdmittedly, I've never had their coffee.  I love coffee, but they've got some killer tea options so I always go there.  \n\nFood is fast and everything I've every gotten has been scrumptious.  The Asian chicken salad is huge and top notch.  The hummus sandwich, on point.  The guys I work with always enjoy the wraps.  I've heard the pot pie is delectable - but I've never tried it for fear that I might need a nap after eating all those tasty calories.  \n\nListen - I've seen a few comments about the staff, and I want to make sure that you know the guys that work there are sheep in wolf's clothing.  Cut them a break, while they may look rough and tough - give them a smile.  They are the sweetest people in the world.  Remember that their job consists of people barking orders at them all day.  You might forget to smile every once in awhile too. Give them a compliment and enjoy your delicious meal!",4
"I didn't really enjoy my time here. Tons of men! I heard its expensive for them to get in (about $30) men have to dress up to a T! While women are in there looks sloppy!! (wearing sandals) it was really crowded on the dance floor! If you are a female do not dance on the little stages bc you will get stared at like a caged animal (unlesss you like that kind of stuff). It was so packed that it was actually kind of gross, I've heard the exact same thing from other people about this place. Stay away.",1
"I swear I drive past this little Mexican restaurant multiple times a week and have never noticed it. One night, we were craving some quality Mexican food and started exploring Yelp to find a nearby Mexican spot that we had never tried and had good reviews. We called to see what time they were closing, because it had conflicting results when we tried to figure it out online. The staff answered and stated that they were closing in 5 minutes, but very kindly said that we could order and pick up if we could make it there within 10 minutes. We don't live too far so it was doable, and we gratefully made our way there while still on the phone ordering. I didn't have too much time to ponder on what I would order so I skimmed through the menu and decided on the shredded beef (machaca) burrito-enchilada style (I'm a fatkid). My man got the combo #1, which included 2 enchiladas, a taco and beans. Both orders smelled amazing, it was hard not to pounce into it in the car. When we got home and started grubbin' it was scrumptious!!! I had to give this place 5 stars based on their awesome customer service and delicious food. I am definitely going to have a hard time ordering something different next time because the burrito was so satisfying. We plan to come back and actually sit and eat for a meal, some happy hour and looking forward to their taco Tuesday! The new menu is a little bit different than the one posted on the Yelp page and they gave us one with our pickup order. I'll post it when I get a chance :). They only take CASH so be prepared!! Definitely a good find, THANKS YELP!",4
"My mother in law was looking for a place to eat.  We just came from the airport, so we came to this side of town to explore our options.  \n\nCalifornia Crab is where we stumbled upon.  Its a cajun joint owned by the previous store owners, turned restaurant.  California crab, it even has a filipino buffet inside.  So yup, cajun style seafood AND an option for Filipino buffet.  They split the restaurant with those that eat buffet, and those that eat cajun.  \n\nToday we did both.  My mother in law had the buffet and my other half split a sisig burrito.  I am not reviewing for their seafood.  We did come in  pretty early, so their options at the buffet looked nice and fresh.  My MIL said that their pansit and pinakbet were tasty.  \n\nSisig burrito sounded a whole lot better than it tasted.  It got served with fries.  It was a pretty big portion, so I did get full off of half of it.  It was sisig, garlic rice, and egg wrapped in a tortilla.  Something I would spruce up with left overs, haha.  It wasn't anything out of this world in that style, but I still would like to try their sizzling platter and other things on the menu too.  \n\nOur server was friendly, but for not having anyone else in the restaurant, he sounded a bit flustered when we were requesting for certain things.  Hot tea, came out warm, not hot, I don't think the hot pot boiled the water long enough.  \n\nAs other previous yelpers stated, its a fairly new restaurant.  I will probably come back to give other things a try, and until I get the wow factor is when I will change my rating.  I do hope they perfect their business.  It has potential.",1
"I visited for dinner.  The service was excellent but the food was only so-so.\n\nPizza was excellent, and so was the sesame chicken but some of the other choices lacked quality or flavor.  There were cheese enchilada's that I swear were filled with nacho cheese sauce. \n\nSalad bar was lacking in fresh toppings, and consisted mostly of canned beans and crunch bits.\n\nThe buffet at Red Rock, though similar, was much nicer and had a bigger selection of food choices.",2
"I'm really on the fence about trying this place again. On one hand, I liked the wine/cocktail list, the appetizers and ambiance. On the other, the service was lacking and the entrees were tiny and oversalted. \n\nMy sister and I came for restaurant prior to seeing a show at Gammage. I made 5:30 reservations so that we wouldn't have to rush dinner. Unfortunately, that's exactly what happened due to a 30 minute+ gap between our appetizers and entrees. Our server never checked up on us or explained what was happening until after we flagged down someone else to order another glass of wine. I was also irked that our server took my silverware after I finished my first course but never bothered to replace it. Luckily, the host sitting at the door rushed over to give me a new set so I didn't have to wait on our server again.\n\nMy sister got the vegan cauliflower bisque which had a light texture and nice basil flavor. I loved my fried manchego. It was like the best part of a grilled cheese sandwich accompanied by a delicious roasted sweet tomatoes. The succotash entree, however, was minuscule and almost ruined by the heavily salted wilted spinach. The shiitakes in the dish were very good though.\n\nThe desserts were both decent. I got the chocolate almond croissant pudding, and my sister got the vegan blueberry coconut parfait. We both agreed hers tasted more like a breakfast dish.\n\nThe patio looks like it will be very welcoming during the cooler months. Maybe after a couple months, I'll be ready to give Revival another go.",2
"I have lived in Place des Arts for three years now, when this little pizza/coffee/wine shop opened up I decided to give it a try for lunch.  They had a large outdoor eating area with people occupying maybe 40% of the tables, we saw countless tables for 3 or 4 outside, however no one was seating anyone out there. We walked in and waited for another 15 minutes for someone to frantically try and seat us outdoors,  she said she didn't know if there were any tables outside but she would take a look, five minutes later she returns saying there is a table at the end of their eating area that could seat the three of us. As we went to sit at the table we noticed other customers had just put bags there as we were getting to the table. We turned around and asked the waitress what was going on, and if they could find us another table ( there were still at least 10 open) and she just said \""No, too bad there's no room\"". Absolutely disgusted we walked to another pizza place five minutes away where they treated us perfectly.",0
"To be perfectly honest, I'm not the hugest fan of breakfast food.  I realize this is odd. However, this restaurant does something I don't care much for very, very well.  I always have special requests regarding my breakfast food (egg whites only, I don't eat potatoes so I always have to make substitutions) and I've never felt like I am being a nuisance.  Their omelettes are divine.  The service is always friendly and quick.  I can't really say anything bad about Egg Works 2!",3
"Great service, the wait staff was super nice, but over priced and food was no good. Would prefer McDonald s.",0
"Not a great show. The host was ok, first act was good.  Headliner was the opposite of good. Extremely disappointing.  Disappointed overall. Go to another comedy show if you can. Or know the comedian before you go.",1
"I have eaten here in the past but stopped by again so I could critically evaluate the food  for a Yelp review.  I arrived ~ 2 pm and was promptly seated.  There was a moderate amount of ambient noise with the music, but I liked the fun atmosphere of the place.  I ordered the Yamato and Sao Paulo rolls since they looked like the most interesting rolls on the menu.\n\nThe food arrived rather quickly.  The yamato roll really looked spectacular with the gold leaf, but there were only three pieces and there was a sweet sauce that completely overpowered the roll so I could not taste the foie gras.  The sauce was tasty, but it would have been nice if the right balance were achieved.\n\nThe sao paolo roll had a variety of fish topping the rolls, and it was quite tasty, but not worth $24.\n\nMy server was attentive and polite.  While the food was good, it was way overpriced given the multitude of dining options on the strip.",2
One of the worst services I have ever had. They seemed completely understaffed and just oblivious to their customers. Quite sad.,0
"i've stayed at the luxor, excalibur, mgm, circus circus, imperial palace, palazzo, off strip hotels/motels, but this is the best one i've stayed at so far. i just love the rooms and the decor; it has a very comfortable room/bed.  even though the palazzo is newer pretty much the same room, there's something about the venetian that makes the stay worth while.",4
I have had many massages over the years and this place was the absolute best!  They were extremely friendly and accommodating and the pricing was extremely competitive.  I will definitely be going back here.,4
I love Cielo! No other salon in Vegas / Henderson has ever done as good of a job on my hair. Penny is the best! The salon always has great specials on spa services too.,4
"My favorite Thai food restaurant. Their soy meat is soo good, and their Penang with soy duck is to die for. I would eat here everyday if it wasn't so far from my house. It's a must try for everyone!",4
"This place is more of a bar than a sushi restaurant. This sushi is pretty average. The quality and freshness just isn't quite there. I've been to many sushi joints in my time, and can tell you that Moto sushi is a decent place for your average sushi consumer, but won't impress most others. Rolls are pretty generic, and sloppily made. Service was good, which is why it gets 2 stars. Prices are up there among better restaurants, so I suggest you look elsewhere cuz it ain't cheap. They have a happy hour menu, and also an all-you-can eat menu...if that interests you. They are the only sushi joint within a few miles, otherwise the competition would eat them up in no time. You can try it for yourself, but I'm just trying to save you a few bucks here...",1
"The food is good.  I had the hawaiian specialty pizza.  If you want a different pizza joint to try, try ordering from North End Pizza.",2
"The parking, customer service on checkin, and room were excellent for the price. There's nothing fancy, but for $19.99, it's a steal. Everything is clean, in decent repair, and recently remodeled. The pool was OK, but was a bit dirty, and there didn't seem to be any staff on hand to maintain or clean it. \n\nThe big problem here is the food. The buffet is AWFUL. Even my 3 year old thought so - she normally devours everything we put in front of her, but touched nothing here except her apple (the one item on the buffet not prepared by Fiesta Henderson staff). My wife liked the Macaroni and Cheese, but changed her mind after they replaced the batch and it started to taste like soap. We watched another patron politely inform a member of the staff that they had mislabeled an item with shrimp as being pork, and listened to the chief get extremely defensive and literally start yelling at the customer. There is \""full service\""; our \""service\"" consisted of a very angry man who seemed quite upset when we asked for chocolate milk for our daughter; \""No, we have REGULAR milk!\"". He then got our drinks, and never stopped at the table or refilled anything after. My daughter was thirsty; it was odd telling her she had to wait until we got back to the hotel room for a drink of water. Meanwhile, I was scratching my head, trying to figure out why the \""international\"" section of the buffet consisted of crawfish, chili mac, and cornbread, and yams (and no, they didn't mix it up with the American section). \n\nI had several concerns about the sanitation and temperature of the food there, too. Several items I tried to sample were so old and dry they were nearly inedible. Many items were never replaced, checked, or measured for temperature, as far as I could tell. I have no idea of their standards or the laws here, so I can't accuse them of doing anything illegal, but their negligence ceraintly showed in the abysmal quality of the food. We were there on a slow Monday night, and other reviewers have said the buffet was 'great', so maybe they only bring out their \""A\"" game on certain days.\n\nWe did breakfast at the Fiesta Cafe and it was slightly better. To her credit, the waitress even went the 'extra mile' to create a glass of my daughter's chocolate milk (an apparently tall and difficult order at the Fiesta), though we had to tell her the 'recipe'. The rest of breakfast was decent and acceptable for a budget, short order breakfast, slightly redeeming the Fiesta food experience. If you have to eat at the Fiesta, go to the Cafe.\n\nYou might think that the \""great hotel, horrible food\"" means you should stay here and just eat elsewhere. The problem is, this hotel is so far (20+ minutes) from the main part of Las Vegas, and going to any of the more well known buffets or food options is impractical. \n\nBottom line: spend the $20 more to upgrade to a substantially better experience on the strip, and spend the money on an infinitely better buffet.",1
Amazing food!  Amazing staff! Amazing talent and atmosphere! Can't wait to go back! We celebrated the new year in class! This was such a lovely venue and great time!,4
"It's a fun place, good atmosphere but that's all.  There's a wide selection of food but most of it wasn't really good.  I could go again but next time to eat the seafood only.  I wasn't too impressed for the $50 price I had to pay for the dinner buffet. This makes for a good lunch spot tho.  It seemed like the beef and lamb chops were sitting out all day, which they most likely were as in most buffets.  The sushi was dry and had absolutely no flavor at all.  I give it an average rating.",2
"I have a van that I bought as a work vehicle.  It wouldn't run correctly but with 84000 miles I figured I was still getting a good deal.  Took it to Lee's and told them to look at it.  They called back days later and said it was a fuel pump and that it would be around $400 to get it going again.  I said ok as I didn't want to deal with it myself.  Then they called the next day and said the fuel tank needed to be replaced as it was \""rusted out\""  I though that was wierd since there was NO rust anywhere else on the vehicle but whatever.  They said they could get a used one for 150$.  I said ok.  The replacement tank looked as if it fell off the truck on the way to their shop.  Literally that is what it looked like.  They then called and said that I needed to get new plugs installed or it still wasn't going to run right,  which was going to run 400 dollars!  For plugs!  I said no I will just take it the way it is.  They said sorry but we already started on it!  WTF!  So now with new pump,  fuel filter,  gas tank and new plugs guess what?  Still doesn't run right.  They say it is going to be another 1100 dollars to change out all of the injectors!  So I go pick it up  buy the injectors myself fro 450 dollars and put them in.  and it still runs the same as when I brought it in there.  Did I mention that I asked for a new belt to be installed while they were into the motor,  which was another $200 and they billed me for it but didn't put it on?  They did refund that money.  So a recap I bought a van for $600  Lees put another $1050 into it and I put another $450 plus my time,  for a job that they were going to charge $1100 for and the van runs exactly the same.  DO NOT GO THERE!!!  I wouldn't let them change a flat tire for me if I was stuck in front of their shop.",0
"Disclaimer Alert:  I don't eat fruits. I can't eat fruits.  So my review is solely based on the cleanliness of Berry Blendz, the service, and my Power Protein Smoothie.\n\nAfter a pretty good workout at Gold's with Terri R, we ended up coming here for our post workout.  We were hoping before coming in that they had something with whey in it and they did.  Berry Blendz has their Power Protein, which consist of a bunch of fruit and 40 grams of whey.  This was perfect, minus the fruits of course.  I ended up substituting the fruits with nonfat yogurt.  I order a medium and got what looked like a large.  My smoothie had an okay, not great, taste to it.  Bottom line, I wasn't looking for taste anyway. I just needed something to assist with recovery after hitting the gym hard.  \n\nBlendz itself was clean when we visited them and the service was okay. One plus with this place is that they have a small sofa or love-seat where we were able to have our post-workout treat and chill at the same time. \n\nPower Protein:  http://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?select=zq0NW4rDIbHJHbWeGykgeQ&userid=y3FcL4bLy0eLlkb0SDPnBQ\n\nNot Mine (This would kill me):  http://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?select=0_eQQ2rzx7Is62fNdDfukA&userid=y3FcL4bLy0eLlkb0SDPnBQ\n\nNot a fork:  http://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?userid=y3FcL4bLy0eLlkb0SDPnBQ",2
"The most perfect Mocha yesterday --  special for me. Whole milk, 1/3 the chocolate so not so sweet.  The chocolate flavor was yummy, and the milk was frothy & steamed to perfection.  The baristas are cute and capable!  and, of course, there's John.  \n\nThe clothing varies, as each artist creates a unique item.  There are wonderful variations on strange and cute polyester double knit, reconstructed dresses evoking an illicit coupling Twiggy and Marcia Brady, yummy sexy slip dresses fit for a faerie.  Big bold copper and stainless buckles and pendants in a modernist style, dainty woven seed bead necklaces, smocked velvet bags.  Painted 33-1/2  vinyl, and delicate pen-and-ink drawings and ACEOs.  A little of everything, and almost all are one-of-a-kind.  Even some of the t-shirts are unique!  (I'm not into t-shirts, but the guys like them swell enough.\n\nIt's a neighborhood shop!  and funky.  So if you want to meet people who live nearby, and hang out there, it's great.  I always seem to meet people there I know from somewhere else --  we must be responding to the same magnet.   If you want Starbucks uniformity and stained birch furniture, well, this is not the place for you.  Even tho the coffee is better! \n\n I just wish they had drip coffee for the times when the line is so long, and I just want caffeine!  But that won't even take away 1/2 a star.  I can survive.",4
"I walked into this place during spring break in the middle of the week with my wife and kids.  I was wearing my Pau Gasol Lakers jersey because the Lakers were going to play that night.  As soon as I walked in, the hostess compliments me on my jersey and the bartender asks me if the Lakers are going to win that night.  Right away they got brownie points for being Laker fans and making me and my family feel welcomed.\n\nSince we got there around 11:30AM, we beat the lunch rush and they sat us down in less than 5 minutes.  The place is nice and open with lots of noice and ambiance going on, perfect for a family with small kids.  My sons ordered the kids pancakes and my daughter order the chocolate chip pancakes.  My wife and I shared the Sage fried chicken and waffles, because I read on yelp how huge the order is.  My kids pancakes where huge.  My 6 year old some how managed to finish his pancake, and he's a skinny boy.  Even the waitress was impressed he was able to finish such a large pancake.  I had a taste of the two different pancakes and they were good, were they the best I've ever had, no, but they aren't bad.  As for the Sage fried chicken and waffles, yelpers were not kidding, this is a huge order,  it's definitely perfect for 2 people to eat.  The Sage fried chicken was extremely tasty and the waffles were like heaven, especially with the bacon made into the waffles.  The combination of the Sage friend chicken, waffles, bacon and syrup was delicatable.  I have been to Roscoes Chicken and Waffles in Los Angeles several times, and I have to admit, this place blows away Roscoes for the fried chicken and waffles dish.\n\nNext time I'm in Vegas or San Diego, I will definitely drop on over the Hash House A Go Go to try some of their other tempting dishes.  Make sure to come with a huge appetite, because all their dishes look pretty big.",3
Disclaimer: Didn't stay/ didn't gamble but..... loved this place. I love the decor and fresh flowers and open non smokey spaciousness of it. The staff was very friendly and I will definitely return here to hang out and perhaps spend a  night or two. The location is only perfect and the variety of restaurants and lounges fit every taste. I think this place is well done and I feel hip being there.,3
"Well now.....this was an experience worth all the money we spent. We went with the four course meal and loved every bit of it. From the complimentary stretch limousine pick up from our apartment to the little \""gift\"" of a cake that was handed to the female guests in our party, it was in a class of it's own. \n\n I must say, that the food, the service , the dress code and the ambiance is unmatched by any other place I have been to in my entire life.  I'm dying to go back!\n\nSimply Loved IT!!",4
"I don't usually review based on one visit.  But when the experience and food is as bad as this, I'll make an exception...\n\nThis place gets two stars for the multiple big screen TVs.  If you're here strictly to watch sports and have a beer or three,  you'll be fairly happy.  However, I came here for a bite to eat, and that's when there where I ran into problems.\n\nThe bartenders are a disgruntled lot.  Their sour mood when I sat down set the tone for my whole experience here.  They're not all bad.  One of the male bartenders actually smiled occasionally and chatted with some of  the customers.\n\nThe food.  How can you screw up cole slaw?  What more can I say? \n\nBeyond that, if you're in the area to watch a game, this isn't a bad choice.  Just swing by McDonald's or somewhere else for dinner.",1
"This Walgreens has the busiest parking lot ever no matter what time of day it is packed! Kind of weird as the store seems empty. It is a standard Walgreens but this one sells liquor. The store is old and run down, the staff seems a bit distant. \nI would never go out of my way to shop here, but it does get a pass for convenience.",1
"Ridiculously good barbecue. I ordered the two meat meal with brisket and rib tips with macaroni salad and bbq beans for sides. The Brisket and rib tips were excellent. Perfect smoke flavor, nice crisp \""bark,\"" and tangy sweet bbq perfectly coating the meat. The macaroni salad is amazing and the baked beans are good too.  I'm stuffed right now, yet craving more. Tom's is awesome. This is one great bbq joint, \""no butts about it!\""",3
"First visit last night and I'll be back. \n\nOur #evfn group had been invited to meet here this week, and there was a whole room set aside just for us. Service people Brandon and Ashley were cheerful and hopping the whole time. We tend to migrate/socialize table to table and they did an excellent job keeping up with the movement.\n\nI had the chicken pie and a generous side salad and couldn't finish it all. And although they didn't carry my usual Strongbow, the Blackthorn cider was excellent. \n\nI expect this stop to become a regular.",3
I really like Sweet Tomatoes but  it is a little pricey but I love their chicken noodle soup.  it has chunks of chicken in it and you need a fork! The chill is good also! Look for coupons and it helps!,3
"Walked in with the family and greeted by 2 workers. Shortly after we walked in, another family came in who clearly was new to the place and had tons of questions about the items. We had started ordering by then. In the middle of helping us, the girl stops and starts helping the other family even though another girl was already helping them. Not cool especially since we arrived first. \n\nOnce we were finally being helped again, I asked for a flavor of ice cream that was written on the whiteboard. The girl replied that it is in the back and refused to get it for me. So I ordered black cherry. Except when I took a bite it was strawberry. \n\nThese high school workers need to learn some customer service. The workers need to be educated on their own products as I listened to the employee answering the family's questions erroneously. \n\nThis was not my usual experience at this shop but these girls need a stern talking to. If I didnt know better, would not return if this had been my first time at the place.",1
"I can't really explain the joy I felt when I first heard that a Mad Mex was opening on Highland. The thought of not having to sojourn to the suburbs and to never again return to Oakland was almost too much.\n\nLast night, after months of drive-by stalking, it was time for us to meet. I was so excited for the complimentary valet parking I'd seen advertised on the sign outside. But when we got there, the sign was gone, there was no valet parking; it was as if I'd imagined it.\n\nMy boyfriend and I ordered chips and avocado tomatillo salsa (our fave) and a burrito each. I ordered a side of sauce with my burrito which arrived not on the side but inside the burrito. Refills were hard to come by. The chips and salsa did not arrive until we had finished our meals, and the salsa was sour and terrible and not even close to the avocado tomatiilo salsa we know and love. And I'm going to sound super old when I say this but IT WAS SO LOUD IN THERE.\n\nThe prices are higher, probably because of the complimentary valet, the hip location, and because this is, for serious, the handsomest Mad Mex ever. It would have been worth it had the food been of typical quality and the service remotely adequate. But alas, I'll be driving back out to the suburbs for Mad Mex because there, at least, they love me back.\n\n*Because this review isn't long enough already, I'd like to take this opportunity to remind all restaurant goers out there to please keep your shoes on. Other people exist and are trying to eat.*",1
"Not really gonna spend too much time on this one, Ive been here twice and my first experience was bad. The second could be broken down like this, 10 dollar beers, 16 dollar mixed drinks and no water. If you want water your gonna have to pay 8 dollars. smh, wont be returning",1
"Honestly I don't know why I still come here. Sometimes just out of convenience, I guess. I needed to fuel up and a car wash. Knowing they do both here and I had just been across the street, I drove over. \n\nDriving up to the pump I was approached my 2 different employees. There were 2 cars in front of me at the gas pumps in the car wash area. I waited my turn and pulled forward to the pump. The employees there were very friendly. I decided on \""The Works\"" for $14.99 +$1 for my SUV and she gave me my invoice, which included my fuel. I went inside and paid, and saw they gave me a $2 \""Ladies Day\"" discount. \nWhen you fuel up and get a wash you get at least a 10 cent/gallon discount. \n\nSitting inside for a while I waited. Knowing they weren't all that busy I moved outside to watch them work on my car. When I picked it up there were still bugs on my chrome brush guard and there was still some tar that even I was able to rub off with my finger. The windows were done pretty half ass. But at least the bird poop that had been on my car for way tooo long had washed off. \n\nThey are ok...but I think I will stick to Los Olivos on 3rd and McDowell.",2
"My friend recommended that I go see Blue Man Group, so my boyfriend and I bought expensive $100 tickets and had high expectations.  Unfortunately, we left the theater feeling very confused.\n\nNo story, just random blue alien-looking guys drumming, splashing paint, and encouraging the audience to wrap streamers around themselves.  I give them an A for their enthusiasm and energy, but other than that there wasn't much else. \n\nMy boyfriend thought that maybe if we had been on something, it would've been a better show.  Hehe",2
"I haven't been back in months.  The last time I went, the man next to me dripped so much sweat, the droplets invaded my space-- I couldn't do my own moves for fear of getting his perspiration on me.  Hey, if the guy was a hottie, I may have not minded half as much... ;)  The room stank like used gym socks and wet leather, and sour anti-perspirant, as well- ugh! \n\nI asked Beth, the owner, if she would ask the male patrons to wear a shirt and not go topless.  She replied that she really couldn't tell people what to wear.  I said it's not telling people what kinds of clothing to wear (i.e. styles), but that men should at least WEAR a shirt, something to catch their perspiration and keep it from splashing all over.  (Something to keep their scraggly hair in place would keep perspiration from the head from spraying onto someone else's space, as well.)  I see the women wearing all sorts of shirts (tees, racerbacks, yoga tops, midriffs, etc) that allow them to feel most comfortable in such heated space, and the result is that I don't see any of their sweat invading the spaces of their neighbors.  Beth said she'd post something in the next newsletter suggesting that the men wear shirts, but after reading about four consecutive newsletters and seeing nothing written regarding my request, I gave up.  \n\nI guess my observations/suggestions didn't matter anymore since I'd signed up and paid for the next 25 passes.  It's been four months since my last conversation with Beth (I searched for my last Yelp check-in), and I still have 21 unused passes set to expire on July 24, 2012.\n---\n7/9/12\n\nBeth Beary contacted me via Yelp email to let me know that she's extended the expiration date of my passes and asked me to not let one experience take my yoga practice away.  It was a good point, and I wrote her a note thanking her for the extension.  She's since posted a message (read below) reiterating what she told me, with the addition of her reason of not telling her patrons what to wear-- that due to the nature of the practice, she did not want people to overheat.  Are we women therefore S.O.L. because we cannot go topless, because that would be public indecency?  Have you seen many of the women who come to practice (most are lean and fit)?  Have you seen some of the men who come to your clinic??  Hmm...  As I've noted before, the female yogis show up wearing different styles, and the clothing helps to keep perspiration from splashing all over the place.  If you would just discontinue allowing the men to go topless, I guarantee you will find more practitioners staying on.  (I know of a former Floo-id practitioner who stopped going bec. of similar reasons I mentioned, and if she and I felt this way, then we can't be the only ones.)\n\nTechnically, you may fit 60 people in that room, but in a heated space and many bodies (of all shapes and sizes) present, people like their spaces and want to leave some room to allow themselves to be able to move their arms freely without hitting their neighbors.  Furthermore, once a class is underway, it usually is quite disruptive for someone to stop, pick up their mat, towel/s, and water bottle to find another space elsewhere.  Most of the classes I've attended here became very full and allowed just enough space for movement-- some of us have had to stagger our mats so as to allow limbs to move around without someone getting poked in the eye!  I find it ridiculous and somewhat condescending to say that the option of moving is available...",0
Excellent value. Food was excellent. Good seaweed salad. Salmon skin roll very good. Here at lunch-good service.  You won't be disappointed.,4
"Really excellent food at very fair prices.  I love eating at Picolo Forno!  First things you should know is that there are no reservations, unless you have a party of 5 or more.  It's very loud, it's BYOB, and the food is fantastic.  I had the Cavatelli con Salsccia e Rapini, which was amazing and I will order this again.  People rave about the Lasgna, although I don't think that is their best dish.  I love the Crostini di Polenta, it's a perfect appetizer.  The Bomba is always a fun dessert.",3
"This place was the only restaurant around that was open on a Sunday for brunch. At first thought, I thought it was pretty cute...but then I realized it was sort of a set up for tourists and I was a sucker. \n\nIf the food blew me away - I wouldn't have cared how cheesy the plastic slabs of meat hanging in the window were! But sadly, my Apple/Brie/Turkey Sandwich came without the apple. I was disappointed - because the apple is what makes it... am I right?",1
"This review is for the Formula Drift event that was held at the Speedway this weekend.  I normally enjoy the Speedway, but this particular event wasn't that great.\n\nIt wasn't the event's fault as the drivers and the action was incredible!  However, it was the experience from a spectators perspective.\n\nFirst of all, the event started at 2 pm in the middle of August!  I realize that the main event didn't start until late in the evening, but come one!  We arrived at 4:30 pm and there wasn't too much shade available besides the vendor tents and even that was brutally hot.\n\nSecondly, while the bleacher seats gave you a good view of the action, I didn't care for the fences and the limited view you got from the street level.\n\nThe food options for this event was pitiful too.  Normally, there are great food options for the NHRA events held at the Strip.  But this event had very few food concessions and the ones that were there sucked.  It was so bad we didn't eat.  Also, the prices were outrageous.....$4 for a Bottle of Water and $5 for a Powerade!  No outside food and drink allowed of course.....rip off!\n\nThe only reason why I gave this event 3 Stars is because the driving was ridiculously awesome.  I have to give these professional drivers a ton of credit.....they are insanely good at what they do.  I want to learn how to drive like that.\n\nWill I return?  Probably, but only at night.",2
"Very competitive pricing, fast turnaround time, and friendly, knowledgeable service. What more could you ask for? I've used them for my business printing needs (cards, flyers, posters, banners) for almost 2 years now, and I'm extremely impressed with them.",4
"I love the live music and atmosphere on the patio.\n\nThe service was good and so was the food. We gad potato pancakes and a pretzel for appetizers. The pretzel was fantastic and the potato pancakes were ok, but not as good as my grandmother's.\n\nI shared the combo for 2 with a friend. The sausage and ham were fab and the little salad was one of the best I have ever had. The ony thing we didn't like was the \nmeatloaf type thing on the combo platter.\n\nThe place cleared out pretty quicly Saturday night... By 9pm, people were packing up the patio.\n\nOverall, it was a great time. I only wish there were some more veggie options for sides.",3
"So pissed off. I have been trying to be a supportive customer to this place multiple times and I've been disappointed with every visit. I've brought three of my cars in and gotten the Deluxe, and made sure that I told them the entire car needs to be vacuumed, including the trunk. They say okay, no problem, and ring me up my $17.99. I wait like 45 minutes (sometimes even longer) in the lobby. When they're finally done, they wave their towel and give me the keys. And each time I come in, to my dismay, there are greasy oil splotches on my car, white dust spots all over the wheel and dust that hasn't been wiped down. I'm fine because I can wipe those small things down, but I am TIRED of not getting what I specifically asked for: the trunk has to be opened and vacuumed inside! My cars still look like a piece of crap inside but now with extra frap that I have to wipe down from their sloppy job! I called in angrily and explained my situation, and he said that they will only vacuum the trunk if you asked for it. And I DID ask for it, THREE TIMES. He put me on hold to get the manager, but the manager just made him a messenger and wouldn't even take the time and show customer service by talking to me himself. He just told the employee to bring my cars back and they'll redo it, which I said No, because every time I did bring it back they did NOTHING. He then offered a refund but I know, as a business owner myself, that his offers were pathetic excuses and I have had enough especially when the manager wasn't willing to speak with me himself. I told him I was done and I'm never coming back, and I did offer him a valuable piece of advice that the company should aspire to do: be detailed in your work, quality over quantity. Maybe if they started putting more effort in the smaller details of their work they wouldn't have so many bad reviews on Yelp and lose their customers to other car wash companies. And the employee's reply? \""Sorry and have a good day!\"" And he hangs up first. If anyone knows a better place to get your car done, please message me.",1
"Thursday night dinner: $34.99. If you want lobster, $10 more. If you want bottomless alcohol, $12.99 more. Arriving at 7pm, wait in line for at least an hour. Sighs~\n\nFood quality is average. Choices are okay. Didn't really WOW me with the price they charge.\n\nFood display is kind of spread out so no long wait line to get the food. However, putting the food inside the heavy pot... not too convenience. First, the lid is way too heavy & hot. Also, you have to put down your plate first then open the lid to get the food?? With the lid on, you can't really see what's inside. Not an ideal way to display the food. \n\nService is bad. Each server is taking care too many tables. Hard to get the server to refill the drink. \n\nNot too impressed with the dinning experience.",1
"I would never have known of this establishment's existence if it wasn't for the small dining area out front with umbrellas and strange wrought-iron flutterby and dragonfly shaped chairs and tables. Not very comfortable to dine in, but cutesy nonetheless. It also helps that I now work in the surrounding area, since Munch-a-Lunch seems to cater exclusively to the business parks around it. Although it's nothing to write home about, it does a pretty fine job of sating my hunger.\n\nThis small hole-in-the-wall joint caters to those on the go with a five dollar sandwich box that consists of a sammich, bag o' chips, candy bar and canned soda. It's a screaming deal compared to most fast food meal deal prices, and you can be in and out in a few minutes. However, if you're willing to wait around a bit (and maybe try out those funky butterfly chairs or watch an old black and white movie on the tele inside), the made to order specials and salads are usually pretty solid and a good bang for your lunch buck. \n\nOne gripe I have with this place is that the consistency is wildly variable depending on the day. I've ordered the Greek salad numerous times (what can I say, I'm a sucker for beets in a salad) and it's been nigh inedible at times due to a heavy hand with the salty dressing and feta cheese. So order dressing on the side if you're a featherweight like me. At times some items have been a bit stale as well. I've had some unfortunate puff pastry that seemed like it had been freezer burned or microwaved a hair too long. And they have a strange propensity for smothering things in sour cream sauce. \n\nThese are little issues in the overall quality of the food though. Sandwiches and salads are always a solid bet, and the Greek menu items have rarely let me down! \n\nGive it a shot if you're in the area. There's worse things you could do to yourself for five bucks.",2
Dinner here tonight at The Feast Buffet was a joke...Server was slow as hell I know its 5 of us keep the refills coming not 1 every 15 min....Our server jose did more fist bumpin' with the homies that work here than anything.   REALLY!!!!,0
"No no no no no.\n\nI love backpacking. I love staying in hostels. I've stayed in many, from Quebec City to Saint Petersburg. This is not a good hostel.\n\nIt is uncomfortable. It's basically a bunch of plywood box rooms set up inside an old church. The outside of the rooms are covered in a huge, weird mural depicting things like beggars, serial killers and teddy bears hanging themselves (no, I'm not kidding). I stayed in a 10-person dorm which was very crowded, even by hostel standards. Ventilation isn't great and you easily find yourself either freezing or sweltering.\n\nIt is dirty. Most of the facilities are located on the basement floor, and to get to them you have to walk through reception and past the common area. The bathrooms are vile and the showers are not much better. They stink to high heaven, there is a lot of mold and I doubt the place has had a thorough cleaning in the past decade. Don't even think about using the refrigerators in the common area. The staff claims they clean them out once a week. This is not true.\n\nIt is sketchy. Although the neighborhood is safe, this is a cheap hostel and some of the folks staying there were definitely transients. A security system exists but it isn't much. You have to enter a code to enter after certain hours, but the code is simple and only changes once per week or so. Even then, staff rarely seem to ask questions about visitors and will buzz people in if they see them standing at the door.\n\nIt is inconvenient. Now, I like walking so I didn't mind that it was a bit removed from the city centre, but this is not a centrally located hostel by any means. The nearest shops of any kind are a few blocks away. It's about 15 minutes from the end of Princes St, 20 minutes from the Royal Mile, and 30-45 minutes from the university. This can mean a long trip home after a night of pub-crawling.\n\nShort story: Avoid. I stayed here because I wanted to check out the Fringe and it was the only option available. If you have any other options, take them. You'll be glad you did.",0
"I love this hotel. It's clean and relaxing. I love that the rooms are all like suites...being able to close off that outside door to the hallway is a big plus in being able to sleep in past 8! It was great having the individual pools by each tower. The lazy river is great, but it gets so over crowded especially by little ones. Personally, I like the distance between the towers and the MGM casino. It's nice to get in a bit of a walk to offset stuffing your face with good food and booze!",4
"The food was decent, had better lobster stuff elsewhere for the same price honestly.\n\nHad the Lobster and Chips... They should consider using actual English type chips (steak fries) instead of french fries.  Also had the lobster mac n cheese; kind of bland honestly.  They gave me a free tasting of the lobster ice cream and that was interesting, but probably would never order a full scoop.\n\nAll in all it's decent food, but for the same amount of money I rather eat elsewhere...",2
"Good food, friendly service, and tasty tastes. If and when they ever expand I will send everyone there. Until then, I won't, because I want there to be room enough to sit next to my woman.",4
"I love having this place practically on my doorstep! It gives the area a bit of a country village feel to it, going to the butchers for your meat and eggs instead of just getting it in the supermarket.\n\nAs you'd expect, the quality is a million times better than the supermarket I always get bacon and eggs from here for a weekend fry-up, and the eggs are proper free range ones that are all slightly different colours and sizes. Unlike supermarket bacon, theirs doesn't shrink down to half the size it was before you cooked it, as it's not pumped full of water. \n\nThey also do ready-made pies and pasties with a load of different fillings, if you can't be bothered to cook yourself.\n\nAs you'd expect, it does cost a bit more than the supermarket. But the service is so friendly and the quality is so good that you really don't mind paying the etra.",4
"Came here for breakfast with G/F after I got off shift. Very festive inside, we were greeted at the front door by the hostess and was sat immediately.(Since we were the first customers of the day). Server was very friendly but kind of slow on the service side. I ordered the country fried steak and eggs and g/f got 8oz ribeye and eggs. The ribeye was very tasty along with their hashbrown, which are shoestring. The only gripe I have is that they do not put enough gravy on the plate, it comes in a separate portion cup (3oz i believe) I like my stuff smothered!!!!! Also its kind of on the expensive side.",2
"I've stayed at the Mandalay a couple of times now - mostly for work, but this last time I added on a weekend for some fun.\n\nOn a purely business front, this is a great convention hotel.  Very convenient.  Lots of good restaurants to eat with coworkers or clients at.  Upscale without being over-the-top.  And in general being a pretty enjoyable place.  Beware though, that depending on which meeting rooms you are in, it may be as much as a 20 minute walk to go from your room to your meeting.  After walking through the casino, past almost all of their restaurants, some of their shops, etc. you finally get to the conference side of the building.  The closer section of meeting space isn't too far, but if you're on the far side it is definitely a schlep!\n\nOn the leisure side of things, the hotel can be a little stuffy for a purely fun vacation.  The rooms are very corporate (although I've got to give them props for a great bathroom - great showers and seperate tubs), the hallways just go on and on, and although it does have shops and clubs, they're not quite as Vegas glitzy as other hotels.  (Which can be a good thing or bad thing depending on how you feel about glitz!)\n\nI've only been here during the winter months, so can't comment too much on the pool areas.  They look awesome, and I could definitely see wanting to lay out on their pool deck and enjoy the sun, sand, wave pool and lazy river!  Maybe someday I'll make it back during warmer months and actually have time to lay out.\n\nI'd definitely recommend Mandalay to business travelers who have the budget for it.  It can be a little pricier than some of the alternatives in town, but a great property for business.  I'd also recommend it for families who have kids who would love the pool area during the warmer months.  There's also a cool looking aquarium that I think the kids would enjoy.  Guess I'm on the fence as far as you single guys and gals out there.  There are certainly cheaper and trendier hotels in Vegas that you can stay at, but if you're looking for a little more upscale environment (without going big like the Wynn) this could be the place!",3
"Went in for a pedicure, decent job.  Nice and clean.  Prices are strange. FYI they charge extra for the scrub it's 5 bucks but I recommend it, felt great!  Nothing stands out as amazing but nothing was bad.\n\nMy mom went with me got a pedi and mani cuticals on nails were cut to short. Toe nails were cut really short to the point of hurting her.",0
I would eat here again. The breakfast is good but super fatty!  Be prepared to eat a meal that makes it so you do not have to eat for the rest of the day.,3
I passed through here looking for something to eat for lunch and promptly left. Nothing looked appetizing at any of the food stalls. Whats up with all the crappy food at this place? The pizza looked like a complete rip off. I must be turning into a picky ass mofo eater cause I swear unless the food is cooked fresh and the best ingredients are used I don't want to get near it.,1
"Do not eat here, nasty food.\n$5.00 for a chicken potato taco.\n$14.00 for 6 shu mai\n$2.00 for hot sauce.... I wouldn't even come back for .99 cents",0
"Be sure that a representative accompanies EVERY customer to do a walk around of the vehicle before allowing them to leave the lot. We were told not to worry about noting all of the dents and scratches, that it wasn't that big of a deal. The vehicle was covered in little X stickers, including the area of a large swipe of paint across the passenger side door. Yet when I returned the vehicle I was blamed for hitting a pole and lying about it. I was trapped in a situation that could have been avoided had the representative simply accompanied me to look at the vehicle during the walk-around. I appreciate that U-Haul \""took my word\"" for the situation, but I do not appreciate being trapped and blamed for an act I simply did not commit.\n\nThis is the third time I have used U-Haul and the third time I have had an unpleasant experience.",1
"The meat was pretty good and the service was also attentive, but similar or equal quality can be obtained from less expensive places. I found it a bit insulting that a 50 dollar filet mignon does not come with a side order which was an additional 11 dollars. Is this typical of expensive places? Also if you are getting the 50% off the main dish deal through tix 4 tonight, you won't save much, they will add an 18% gratuity off the original price, not the discounted one. I would recommend to go instead to McCalls Heartland Grill at the Stratosphere. Similar service and quality for 1/2 less.",1
"Lemme just add to the wonderfulness that is Lo-Lo's. Although I have only been to the Scottsdale one, I must say it was wonderful. Chicken yum! Waffles yum! Candied yams yum! Mac & Cheese yum!",4
"We actually planned on going to Drai's as our main club that night. We arrived early  ( 1:30am) and got in the door no problem.  It was 9 guys and 3 chicks  ( it had to be my buddies rare creative rec's that got us in). I had a good time since the minute I walked in. Drink prices are a bit steep   ( 8$ for a water , 8$ a beer , and 12$ a mixed drink) it was packed for a Saturday/Sunday night. Lets just say 90% of the people in the techno room are \""rolling deep\"" with homies. The other part is a VIP room until 4 or 5 am when its all access and its a hip hop room. T he cover charge SUCKED   20$ for  chicks and 30$ for dudes. This is  the place to be afterhours !",4
"Love this place! Every time I come here I spend so much money because of all the amazing stuff they have. My boyfriend lived in Japan for a while so I'm glad we can enjoy a place like this in Vegas. The bentos they offer are delicious. They have a great selection of fresh baked breads, fresh vegetables, fish and meat, beer and sake, and all sorts of sauces. Their frozen section is really good, too. The frozen meat is sliced perfectly thin for shabu-shabu at home. I also really enjoy the frozen takoyaki. At the front of the store they have a little corner of decorations/bowls/stickers/erasers that are super cute. The ladies who work here are always friendly and remind me of the cute little lady on the YouTube channel 'CookingWithDog' lol. I'm really happy this place exists and is really like what they have in Japan.",4
"Formerly known as Prive, I thought the name change would change the vibe of the club, WRONG! \n\nCramped, cramped, cramped! The layout of the club is horrible. You really feel like you're crawling all over people. \n\nMaybe 3rd time will be a charm... or maybe not.",0
Just regular tasting burger but way too overpriced!  Long wait and it's not worth it.,0
"My daughter and I had dinner yesterday and can I say it was very unpleasant from start to finish. This was my second time eating here and it was extremely different from my first visit. The price has gone iup to 49.50 they offer a $20 off coupon which is an absolute insult since they actually add an 18% tip to the bill whenever you use their coupon. We arrived at 5:25 for our 5:30 reservation and had to wait 15 minutes to be seated. It was another 20 minutes before we were approached with any meat offerings. When they did arrive, they would show up meat that had blood dripping for it. This actually made me nauseated after the third time. They need to really step up it up. My 13 year old said to me as we were leaving \""Mom, I was not impressed\"".",1
"Anything that saves over 90 bucks gets 5 stars from me!\n I walked over to the one under the coke bottle next  to MGM Grand at about 7 pm on a sunday night, no line, looking for something starting at 10 pm to give us time for dinner. There was still quite a bit to choose from- mostly burlesque type shows starting that late, but they even had tickets available for Zumanity at 60-something bucks. Other shows available included Fantasy, Bite, Peepshow, and Divas Las Vegas. I opted for Crazy Horse at MGM for $30 a ticket (half off!), walked right over to MGM and exchanged my vouchers. The show was great. I will definitely buy tickets here in the future- one of the only things in vegas that is not a ripoff!",4
"Despite staying at the Wynn the last time I was in Vegas, I never got the pleasure of visiting Tryst. I finally had the opportunity to do so this past weekend on one of those spur the moment trips to Las Vegas.\n\nPer usual, the club here doesn't open until 10PM. My two friends and I (all males) arrived early at around 9:20. Sure, a little early but I'd much rather wait 40 minutes and build some rapport with the hosts rather than coming at around 11PM and wait 2 hours or so and acting all pissed off when I can't get in.\n\nAlso, screw paying more than $30 dollars to get in. I have never paid off any bouncers or doormen to get in. I thought we were going to get in right at 10, but it ended up being around 10:15 that we actually came in. Why? Bottle service. Now I have nothing against bottle service, but it was just that it made the wait a little bit longer. So expect to wait a little bit and let the people getting bottles to get in and get situated with their tables. As for me, I'd rather be dancing my ass off and talking to the ladies.\n\nDress code was fine. If you make some sort of effort to look nice they'll let you in. (So fashionable t-shirts, jeans, etc are okay). We were let in after a few more minutes and worked our way down the stairs. Careful people, these stairs can spell death if you're navigating it in a drunken stupor. We paid our 30 dollar cover and was immediately greeted with the sight of a gigantic waterfall. I had seen pictures before but seeing in person was quite amazing.\n\nFrom the entrance, to your right is a bar and the restrooms and a bunch of VIP tables, left more VIP tables (they basically encompass the club) and another bar.  The outside was definitely something unique. I've been to Pure before and they have that nice terrace, but it was so soothing to be somewhere cool both visually and physically.\n\nDrinks are expensive, but you should already know that since you're going to a club in Vegas. My best advice, as always with Vegas, is: 1. get your stamp 2. go back out and booze it up for cheap/free 3. come back when the club is cracking. Of course it's inevitable that you'll buy a drink...or 8 once you're inside. I paid 10 bucks for a beer and around 15 for premium drinks. Yikes. Good thing I had a bottle of Patron waiting for me outside.\n\nI went on a Saturday night which is usually a safe bet (hah) in Vegas. Numerous bacherlorette parties, birthday parties and single ladies were present. They were all...very friendly.\n\nClubbing overall can be a hit or miss and I know some places, despite how popular they are, can have their off nights. I had a great time at Tryst and I look forward to visiting it again.\n\nTips: Visit my friend Jerry the bartender. He hooks it up. And fellas, don't go to female bartenders they're like the Sirens - so seductive and you leave questioning how you spent so much money for a beer.",4
"Need to watch some football, grab a beer and get chips and salsa... Wahoo is your place. Want to enjoy some delicious tacos, beans and rice...not so much. Lemon Drop Martini, how can you not know how to make one... YUCK! Big pieces of tasteless chicken tacos, beef tacos were inedible, again big pieces that were chewy and plain gross. Pork was OK but somewhat tasteless and fish taco just ok! This place has a lot going for it but poor bar-tending, OK service and sub-par food make it it somewhere I will not go back to...Pick Jasons Deli next door or head to Kona grill..and with Gordon B and Cheesecake F in the same complex they better step it up or step out! Don't expect to enjoy a beer here next summer...just my opinion!",1
"Not normally big on taco shops but this one is on the top of my list as a \""must eat at once a week.\""  Super affordable, great flavor and atmosphere.",4
"My wife and I just ate here for lunch based on a recommendation from a local. This is one of the worst buffets I've tried in Vegas. The food was less than mediocre, and in most cases barely edible. Breads were stale and dry, flavors of most things seemed bland and cheap, and a platter of \""fresh\"" burgers just put out were already cold. Avoid this buffet and spend your money elsewhere!",0
"Went here because of a groupon, will probably not go back without one.  \n\nCons:\nOverpriced, flat out.  Plus, like other reviewers have said, they RUN OUT of a lot of good stuff.  Also, I know this is something small, but as their menu changes, they should update it online.  Had I known the menu would be so different, I would have waited for another week to get a meal I would ACTUALLY want (as opposed to settling).  Also, we had reservations and had to wait 20 minutes.  Not a huge deal, but a personal pet peeve.\n\nPros:  \nThe food was good, but like I said, overpriced.  Since I had a deal, I didn't mind as much.  Atmosphere is nice, and I loved the extras (we got a few small tasting, palate cleansers?).  The cotton candy was fab, and though the strawberry dessert was NOT my first choice, it was truly delicious, and I may go back JUST for that dish!  I love the location, and the staff was incredibly friendly, informative, and courteous.  \n\nKnock down the prices and I'd give it at least 4 stars!",2
"Unimpressed with having to wait more than 10 minutes for anybody to acknowledge our table. On lunch break and pressed for time; person who turned out to be our waiter clearly saw us with no drinks, menus down yet couldn't rush away fast enough (twice!) when eye contact was made. Food delivered to table by the host who had seated us, which we then had to switch with one another because he didn't know who ordered what (party of two). Lunch menu looked interesting enough and prices were reasonable; however I'd rather spend my money elsewhere. Definitely an instance of mediocre to poor customer service outweighing the possibility of excellent food. Not likely to return.",0
"It just sucks. The line was short because no one was there. There are 3 tables not reserved with only 2 chairs each, if you want to sit there are stairs outside. The key here is to not go. It is small in amenities, reputation and service. Gladly walked out.",0
"Delicious food, wonderful lunch menu.  Super cute patio.",4
"Stopped in on a Saturday night at about ten pm and got a table right away. \n\nI got a blueberry hill drink that felt like it needed something more, or a little bit less of something. Still a large drink, and not too bad. \n\nWe ordered the appetizer of rosemary brie.  The menu said serves 2 but definitely more like 4. Had left overs. \n \nFor burgers we got the BLT and the Nogales burger med rare. The food came quick and the staff very friendly. \n\nBLT was AWESOME. Juicy and flavorful. Snagged one bite of the Nogales, and it was tasty too. \n\nHighly recommend and will definitely come back.",4
"You are at the mercy of who is the comedian at the time you go.  Sometimes you can be lucky and get a really good comedian.  Other times, the comedian can be not so good.  So, it can range from 1 to 5 stars depending on who you see.\n\nThe atmosphere is fine and comfortable.  The Improv is a good place to hang out with friends and enjoy a show.\n\nOverall, the Improv is a good value for Vegas.  The price is reasonable.",2
I think all of the other reviews have pretty much summed up Selwyn Pub.  They have a great outdoor area for the summer and plenty of fans to keep you cool.\n\nI usually go here for drinks but I've had their pizza and nachos and both are very good.  The other night I had the privilege or trying the Tuna Medallion wrap and it was hands down AWESOME!  It is packed with tuna cooked just right (pink in the middle) and very flavorful.  For $8.99 with a side it can't be beat and is now my favorite item on the menu.,4
"I came with high hopes thinking it was going to be one of the best places to have a burger. Specially because I love bobby flay!\nI'm sad to inform that the burger (the Dallas) was just ok. Edible, but not delicious. The onion rings... The batter tasted good but the actual onion was too mushy. It grossed me out. I just ate the batter. My friend ordered a salad.... And it was the saddest salad we had ever seen, they even served the butt of the lettuce. It was way too pricey for what we got. \nI'm sorry bobby, but whoever is running the kitchen is not living up to your expectations.",1
"I went today to use a groupon and they were out of almost everything.  No sandwiches, no vegan cheese, no whole wheat pasta.  The place was dirty and empty and I was there at noon.  I finally ordered enough to spend my $30 groupon,  and after a couple minutes, the employee came to tell me that she didn't have the ingredients to make what I ordered.  I'm really surprised this place is still in business.  Thankfully, Groupon refunded me the $14 we payed for the groupon.  We ended up having a nice lunch at Cafe Rio.",0
"Went for the first time in November 2011. Best Porterhouse I ever ate. Just went July 2012, Porterhouse was delivered dry and way overcooked. Talked me into getting a Filet as a substitute. Arrived blood rare. Was still looking for medium-rare. It went back for another 10 minutes, and came back fine. Flavor was not as good as I remember. Seemed under seasoned and dry. Huge difference from November 2011. I've had WAY better steaks at Ruths and Flemings. Too bad this steak house can't deliver a good steak anymore.",1
This review is for the lunch and for the Sunday buffet. Both are over-priced but we did not mind during the lunch when we had a more laid-back meal. The buffet food varied from good to great and for the price it should have all been perfect. For lunch I had the bento box and my wife had the turkey club. All of the servers were courteous and professional.,3
"I DO NOT RECOMMENDED AT ALL!! Room was not great at all and the pool is a joke. When we called and told them about our horrible experience, they did give us two free nights though.",1
"Place is OK\nLarge menu borders on pho, soups , chow meins\n-mussels in basil -ok...nothing special \n-chefs spicy chicken...ok...not spicy really...just a bunch of pepper pods\n-beef chow fun...like beef stroganoff in gravy Chinese style\n...looking around almost everyone was having soups so maybe that is their forte?",1
"Impressive!   I dined at House of Tricks last week based on the Yelp reviews and was not disappointed.    The aromas from other's food while sitting around at bar let me know I was in for a good meal.   I had trouble deciding what to eat, so I ordered 3 appetizers:   Seafood Stuffed Poblano Pepper, Veal 2 ways, and Braized Oxtail.    The bartender did a fantastic job of recommending the order in which i received my food - lightest to heaviest.\n\nThe \""Veal 2 Ways\"" and \""Braised Oxtail\"" were phenomenal.... a great combination of flavors and texture.   I think I'd put them both in my list of Top 10 dishes.   \n\nI can't wait to travel back to Phoenix to eat there again.    I'll also add the I really like the atmosphere.   Very chill place, but elegant without being stuffy.",4
"Terrible service here...Takes forever to get someone to take your order inside, even when there's clearly already a line when I show up. When it came time to fill my drink cups, I didn't see any medium size lids and asked one of the staff members for some. She handed me one even though I had 2 cups and it took another 2-3 min for me to get her attention again. They also have a sign on an empty napkin holder saying that they include napkins with every order, however, when I left with my order I realized that I did not get any napkins or utensils. This location sucks. Rude and slow staff, and no utensils, plates or napkins are included unless you specifically ask for them.",0
Running around I got the munchies and stopped in for a couple of egg McMuffins.  They tasted the same as they have since they were invented in Santa Barbara decades ago.  The staff was friendly and I got my sandwiches quickly.  \n\nI thought I had reviewed this location several years ago when I was here for a UYE fundraiser for Julia T's school.,2
"When we arrived, the bellhop a and valets very extremely friendly and helpful, but at the check in desk we found out that our booked room was taken, the receptionist seemed very stingey on making up for our reservation too. The hotel is very beautiful, with a very elegant young feel to it. \n\nIn the room was when we realized they seemed to be nickel and diming. The refrigerator was full of all kinds of drinks but with very manipulative sensors installed that automatically charge once moved. We asked the bellhop to remove them entirely so we may use the refrigerator, he assured housekeeping will come in about 10 minutes to do just that but eventually never came at all. (Later in the trip we called to get more towels in our bathroom as 4 people use the amount house-keeping leaves in one day. They never came. )\n\nWhen I tried accessing the wifi hotspot either my iphone or the redirection link to allow access did not work at all. I found out you need to open Safari to initiate any response, and even then there was some problem with billing issue which made us call the helpline. For the price of the room, I was surprised to discover that not only is wifi not free, but it is limited to only two devices regardless of if we had a double queen bed room. \n\nInside the room we had noticed numerous switches broken, a wall plug that didn't work,  and a pole to the balcony banister broken off. Not a dealbreaker, but c'mon.\n  \n\nOverall it isn't the worst experience to be imagined but there was a lot of potential for having a great consistent customer experience, in which I did not receive.\n\n-------\nOver the trip I decided that this hotel is good for meeting up at to find some pretty cool bars, but as far as customer service and staying at the hotel, it's irritated our friends multiple times this weekend.",1
"Palms.. wow.. what's HAPPENED to you?\n\nI lived in Vegas for several years a while ago when the Palms was at the top of its game; new clubs were opening, the tower was going up, Playboy was an iconic partner and a grinning George Maloof was a frequent presence on the casino floor.\n\nWhat a difference a few years make.\n\nWe recently visited Palms to see how it was holding up now that Maloof has been removed from the helm, and I have to say, I was fairly shocked by the overall feel of the place. What used to be a bright, fun, vibrant locals place by day and tourist hotspot by night has completely degraded into a mediocre experience at best. The casino is VERY crowded still by locals during the day - but the number of machines on the floor has been reduced since the last time I was there. Walking into the place from the valet, I was shocked to immediately see how much Palms' video poker arsenal has been disbanded. This used to be a go-to place for video poker fans - now, you find more machines at other locals places such as Palace Station. That's a shame, since most locals play video poker almost exclusively - you DO know this, right Palms management? Right?\n\nAnyway, the great Mexican place that was a Maloof staple - Garduno's - has closed and re-opened as another \""upscale resort\"" dining experience that the folks running Palms say is \""sexy\"" and \""exciting\"" - you know, something Vegas has never seen. How about great food that was affordable for everyone and a joint that was always busy? Meh. Guarduno's had the most amazing avocado salsa ever. Such a damn shame.\n\nOther than the fairly new Earl of Sandwich location in its food court, I honestly can't see why anyone would purposely stop at Palms; certainly not for the casino. The buffet was always blah, even under Maloof; I am going to venture out on a limb and say that's likely not changed either, or is worse than ever before. I guess if you see an over-priced concert at The Pearl you may visit Palms.\n\nIt's just sad when you see a casino that was at the top of its game completely worn down to a pile of steaming blandness in a matter of years. Very sad, and I honestly don't see a return visit in the near future, if ever. You're better off going to Palace Station or Gold Coast for better casino action and food venues. That's pretty sad.",1
"Had dinner there today.  No one charged us a cover to eat at 5pm.\n\nServer was good as there were 12 of us. No problem splitting the check since I asked before we ordered.\n\nFood was good but pricey ...\n\nGlass of reisling wine $9\nBBQ salmon $26 - excellent - was served with a cream corn sauce, included 4 large shrimp and thin crispy onions\nGarlic bread $4.50\n\n18% tip since we were a large group\n8.1% clark county tax\nMy grand total was just under $50\n\nWould only go back for drinks or a special occasion if someone else wanted to go... too pricey for me to be a regular here.",2
"If you wanna feel fulfilling at a reasonable price. This is the right place to go. The premium steak was juicy and huge! A must-go in Vegas. The only problem is it is too popular, need to wait for a while before you can get in.",3
"Gil was so friendly, super professional.  The New Mexico enchiladas were delish!!!! Hands down for this place!!!!",4
Ate here and saw the Dandy Warhols here. Dinning experience was mediocre. Venue for concert was pretty damm good!,2
"Definitely worth it, between two of us we had the Kobe filet, prime rib, Mac and cheese, baked potato, bread pudding, and the terra cotta. Everything surpassed our expectations and even though I do not like desserts typically the pudding was awesome! The terra cotta was good but way too sweet to finish. Would go back any chance I could get",4
After a day of drinking on the strip it doesn't get much better than a hot dog smothered in chilli and cheese. Open late. It was worth the calories!,3
"I rely on Yelp reviews more often than I take the initiative to write one. That will no longer be the case. \nLike others, we noticed how empty the place was at 6:30 on a Saturday night, never a good sign and  $80 a head later we understood why.  \nLinguine with clams not much flavor.  Laughing Bird Shrimp Risotto, very bland and soupy.  Orecchiette overpowered by salty \""local sausage\"".  Special on the menu, Gnocchi with Chorizo was just ok. \nNot the quality we expected.\nCaesar salad was good but pricey. Tiramisu was served in a chocolate cup, unique and tasty.   \nService was slow. Other tables appeared to be hotel guests not locals.",0
Hotel rooms are very clean and modern. Room service is the best on the strip. The casino is not my favorite. Beautiful spa and work out facilities. I highly recommend an airbrush tan by Melissa. Incredible job! I recommend making reservations at the country club and going for the fixed menu of the season.,2
"Brought in my 2007 Honda Accord for an oil change and power steering hose as part of a recall.  STELLAR service from these guys - Deborah was a pleasure.  Professional all around, friendly, clean facilities.\n\nMost of all they were honest and did great work.  They warned me of some potential problems but with no up-sell whatsoever.  The shuttle even brought me door-to-door for the long wait.\n\nSigned up just to post this review.",4
"Not bad! I thought they were great until I went to the Bayou. Now I swear by that place. New Orleans Take-Out is much cheaper. I lived in the south for a few years and this place doesn't quite manage to get the taste right. I don't know what it is. It's still pretty good though, just doesn't satisfy my cravings. I LOVE their cornbread. Sometimes I just get orders of that.",2
"Staff:  Always have great service when we go here.  Dunno if he's one of the managers and I can't ever remember his name, but he takes really good care of us as do the waitresses.  They have industry discounts too!\n\nGoods:  I'm a beer gal, so I wish they had a bigger beer selection, but I do just fine with Blue Moon.  I've had a few of their martinis, Mango Madness is my favorite.\n\nAtmosphere: DJ L1 is the buiz.  And on Thursdays they have a live band inside.  I think Thursday is Salsa night?  I wouldn't try to go for serious Salsa dancing though, that place gets packed!  \n\nI'm really picky about going out.  I'm not a fan of clusterf%$ks of people and I have to be in a certain mood to listen to House all night long; but if you say Blue Martini, I'm there.",4
"On my travels this summer I stopped at this bar for a night cap with my fianc\u00e9, from the looks of the place, it looks like a great bar with live music, but what a rude awaking, I tried to order a drink and it took about five minutes to get the bartenders attention, and there was only about five people sitting at the bar! Then I tried to request a song for the band to play and the musician was such an a** he had to stop what he was playing and call me out, saying that it must be important that's why I was stand near the stage! I was stun that a business would higher such a rude musician to play at there bar! My experience at this place was all the way around bad! I just walked out after being treated so poorly!",0
The raspberry pomegranate was my favorite of the 3 I tried. Clean and friendly atmosphere otherwise.,3
Very shady people I called bill on a ad on Craig's list he post them by owner  I called him he tells me he is a whole saler but no tax he is cheating state on sales tax and dis honest person I called on a truck tells me has hail damage few hundred to fix yea ok bs 200 dollars to fix a truck with hail damage he cheated lots of people they are in proces of changing their name I talk to adot they are going to look in this matter and get back to me I will let u no how it went look on Craig's list u will see his posting on fleet trucks,0
"We had a wonderful meal with our family and friends.  The food was awesome!! Our captain was good but Tex, the assistant, was phenomenal!! However, one of the staff person by the name of Jon was awful. He did not smile,  very intrusive and seemed annoyed when we asked for our leftovers to be packaged.  Will we go back? Possibly but if Jon waits on us, we will not stay.",2
We went to this location last night for my birthday. Well it wasn't a very happy birthday. Our server was Buddy and he wasn't very friendly. He kinda just threw our stuff at us. He seemed like he didn't want to be there. His bad mood started to make me get into a bad mood. My boyfriend had mentioned to him that it was my birthday and he didn't even ask if I wanted anyone to sing and bring out a dessert. He didn't say anything about it. No happy birthday. Nothing about out costumes. We actually had another sever come up to us and talk to us about our costumes and was super friendly. I wish I had gotten his name and I wish we had him as a server. \n\nMy food was ok. My boyfriend said his pizza was terrible. \n\nOverall last night was a horrible experience. Now I know not to go to this location for a late dinner.,0
"I have been to several Michaels on the east coast some small some large, this one is a pretty good size. You'll probably be able to find most of your arts and crafts supplies here. Now the harder part is finding someone to assist you if you have a question or need to get something off the wall.\n\nI had come there looking for an easel, and sure enough I found one, didn't take me but 2 minuets. However there was an \""ask for assistance\"" sign, so I set about on search of an employee to help me. \n\nAfter 10 minuets on safari I saw them, standing there, in pack formation. I awaited for a moment of silence between them and struck with, \""excuse me\"". Then I had proceeded to ask for assistance.\n\nThe pack looked stirred and their alpha male was clearly unhappy, as he gazed towards me with discontent. Quickly one of the younger females attempted to neutralize the situation and agreed to assist me.\n\nAfter our trek back to the valley of the easels, the lady rummaged through some boxes that I could have reached and produced the model easel I was looking for. Disappointed that my previous quest was folly but glad to have obtained what I had set out for, I thanked her and proceeded to one of their counter merchants.",1
"Came during happy hour ,and was charged regular price for happy hour specials.  Worst BBW in vegas. They don't honor there policy.",0
"Normally we have breakfast here, but we got up a little late so thought we'd give them a try for lunch. It was packed as usual but we got a nice booth and didn't wait too long. We were given our drink order right away and our food arrived on time. My boyfriend got the triple stack blt and I had the California burger. \n\nI think they confused triple bacon with triple bread. There was only 3 pieces of bacon on the triple decker club style sandwich. On the plus side, his potato salad was excellent. \n\nMy cheeseburger, which came with half a head of lettuce and half of a tomato had a quarter size spot of shredded unmelted cheese on it, hidden under a salad. The burger was cooked correctly and it was tasty, it just wasn't a cheeseburger. \n\nAfter we were finished eating we waited about 15 minutes before our waitress appeared to ask if we wanted boxes for the pile of uneaten bread on my bf's plate. We got our check and went to pay. The girl at the counter was talking to two other waitresses. I said hello and handed her my check. She completely ignored me grabbing my bill and card off the counter and continued to talk to the other girls. Not once did she tear away from her conversation or even glance in my direction while flinging my card and receipt on the counter. \n\nReally Black Bear? Is it really that difficult to find a better hostess? It'll be a long time before we come back, and it's because of her, not to mention you're charging $9 for untoasted white bread and lettuce. Perhaps janelle would be better suited at busing tables or washing dishes, since she obviously doesn't understand that being a hostess/greeter means you actually have to greet people.",2
"i decided to stop by after hearing great reviews from my fellow students. I ordered a veggie hummus sandwich. There was one ticket in front of mine (I heard her call out the ticket orders). A group of three girls came in after me followed by another customer. They all ordered and sat down. One after another all four people got their orders and I still had not received mine. After about 25 minutes, I enquired about where my order was (to the man working in the kitchen and delivering the food) and how four people who came in after me had already received their food. His response was that they work on the easiest orders first and that mine should be up soon. Personally, I didn't think a hummus sandwich was overly difficult. After another 5 minutes had passed, the woman who rang up my order asked if I still had not received my food, I told her no and repeated what I had been told. She apologized profusely and another employee (I'm assuming a manager) also apologized. Within minutes she rushed to the kitchen and began to personally work on my order. She also offered me a free pastry and tea for my trouble. While I was convinced I would give them a bad review, they were able to redeem themselves, continued to apologize, and did everything they could to make up for the slow service. Honestly, I will probably try them again seeing as how the do have a lot of great reviews. Plus, my sandwich was delicious!",2
We order the chicken nachos and Turkey burger. It was just OK nothing special the chicken was dried out and tough to eat on the nachos. The service was good and had plenty of TVs to watch the games.,2
Better then McD and Bk. The Rally burger is kind of small the fries were good. Overall great alternative. Will try more options next time.,2
"I live in Squirrel Hill, which means that getting to the Waterfront can either take 15 minutes or an hour, depending on the random traffic conditions across the bridge. Once in the Waterfront, there is literally nothing unique about the stores that populate the complex. There is every mid-level big box store you can think of, but nothing particularly upscale. The architectural elements of the former steel mill are kind of interesting, but there was no effort to incorporate them into an overall theme. \nThe worst part is that once you get there, you still have to drive everywhere! If you go to Lowes, it's about a half a mile to the Target, so you have to get in your car and drive again. Terrible atmosphere. While some of the stores might (!) get higher ratings, the overall complex gets an F.",0
"Solid 3 maybe a bit higher. Late nite in terminal c it sure beats fast food. Steak fried rice is pretty good with a cold Singha beer. Note, this is a twenty, but it tastes pretty good for airport food.",2
"Wings were good (not better than others) Service was good except :::: Like the airlines they are nickle and dime you.  They ask :\""carrots or celery ranch or blue cheese\"" . What they don\""t ask is you will pay for them.... $.60 each for 3 celery stocks and a small cup of dressing.  It add over $4.00 to our bill.  Sorry Buffalo, on to the next hunting grounds.   Did I add, too loud to talk.",0
"Good music, good service, good wine list, but an OK food. My husband and I was told by the concierge in the hotel that Modavie is a french bistro, but when we arrived, we saw \""wine bar\"" on their sign! Ops, we walked in without too high expectation on the food. And it turned out we were right. The menu is mixed( glad that they didn't have any Chinese fusion dish), but the wine list is pretty well rounded. Haven't seen Opus one for a long time except recent trip to Smith & Wallensky! But over all it was good restaurant and we enjoyed our night there.",3
"This place is amazing! Their garlic knots are so delicious, the pizza is pretty good & the service is good. I can't complain!",4
"I really don't know how to even review this place. There are so many choices from every different ethnic background. There is also something called \""Krazy Sauce\"" that seems to be on just about every item.\n\nThe inside is nuts. I really can't describe it properly. It is cheesy and themed. \n\nI love it.\n\nThe grits are absolutely incredible. They are jalapeno grits. omg.\n\nI did not see the banana pudding from fat city- but I really hope it does make an appearance. \n\nThe beers are way over priced though.",3
"Sometimes, you just really want to have a nice, hot bowl of Pho.\n\nSometimes, the place you REALLY want to go to is closed, with no reason posted...so in those times, you go to your old standby.\n\nPho Saigon 8 is my standby. \n\nI've always had good food here, although the service sometimes leaves a little to be desired, as was the case yesterday.\n\nI went with my boyfriend, best friend, and girl friend, and we were seated right away. \nWhen our server came by to take our order, my best friend said \""Can we please have someone wipe down the table?  Its VERY sticky.\""\nServer said \""oh ok.\"" took our orders and walked away...and did not come back.\n\nA runner came out with the veg for our pho, and my friend said to this one: \""Before you set those down, we had asked to have the table wiped down, as its very sticky.\""\n\nShe apologized, and asked our server for a rag...and was ignored.  So she went over and got one herself and took care of the table.  \n\nAfter that, we had no problems \n\nThe food quality was standard.  Not as good as the other place I wanted to go, but it definitely satisfied the weeks of cravings I had been having!  \n\nI'll gladly come back to Pho Saigon 8.  Its not my first choice anymore, but it will certainly do in an emergency.",2
The worst service possible and if you love everything drenched in olive oil please order anything cause there is no shortage there! Waitress cared less for the plates stacking on my table! Thanks for allowing me the opportunity to never wanna come back and recommend the same for anyone who reads this or I know!,0
"As a regular bowler and have visited the actual Brooklyn location, I found this location to be a complete let down. $30 for a half hour of bowling and a band rehearsal or sound check while bowling isn't the best ideal way to spend $30. The actually place is cool but wouldn't recommend bowling here at all.",1
This is one of my favorite places to eat in town! They have a great vegan menu.,4
Got table service at Surrender to see Skrillex. Our host Brandy was awesome and walked us right in with no waiting and no fighting the crowds. Servers and security were very attentive to whatever we needed. Good mix of fun people and the layout was good for mingling with all the cool people. We dropped $4K and had a blast!!! Highly recommend Surrender!!! Can't wait to go back when it's warm for a pool party.,4
"We enjoyed the grand opening at the Summerlin location. The place looks great and the staff was great. We enjoyed the evening and almost everything. However, the bar-be-que shrimp was a disappointment. Four medium out of shell overcooked shrimp with hard rice. Lets do this classic dish correctly. Use large in shell shrimp and rethink the sauce. Missing the garlic.",3
"The food is okay but service can improve, A LOT.\n\nFOOD (first order)\n1) Catfish Basket with Fries (Med heat) $10:  Best thing! The basket comes with large pieces of fried catfish.  They taste amazing, tender, and extremely moist ^_^ The fries are crisp on the outside and soft on the inside (my fave way to eat it!).  The Med seasoning is a dry season and was pretty good as it had a teeny tiny kick but you can still taste the food.\n\n2) Gumbo with rice $6: Dont get this item.  Totally not worth it!! The gumbo was pretty bland that I had to put in a ton of Tabasco to make it taste like anything.  They barely give you any rice (please see the Service note below). \n\n3) 2 lb. Crawfish (She-Bang seasoning and Med heat) $10/pound:  When the bag was first placed on the table, all you see are super large crawfish soaking in a bath of liquid yumminess.  Then you grab one and is let down that there isn't even a small kick to the Med heat.  And the more you dig in, the more you notice the crawfish are smaller and smaller.  Yes i understand that it is still by weight so its not like you're getting cheated... but I want big ones and that's that!!\n\nFOOD (2nd round of orders): \n1) Chicken Tender with Fries (XXX heat) $7:  The chicken tenders aren't anything special and the pieces are not large (but at least they weren't small lol).  Same fries except the XXX seasoning was all heat and no taste.  \n\n2) 2 lb. Crawfish (She-Bang seasoning and XXX heat) $10/pound: So i should have explain their heat level earlier - the XXX is suppose to be the hottest one as its stated on the menu \""Cant feel my mouth\"" and the level right above that is the Med... They need to figure out something to go in between the Med and XXX.  The XXX was indeed spicier then the Med but if you're a restaurant you should know that a hot level should still mean you maintain the taste of your food! \n\nThere was so much cayenne/chili pepper in the dry XXX heat that you couldn't taste any of the food.  All you get is a coating of dry power that overwhelm your taste buds.  \n\nI would like to make a point that is probably not that important but for me I feel like its something worth noting... They only give you one corn when you purchase at least 2lb. bag of crawfish. Which is fine... but where is the potato!?!? Yes I know this isnt Hot n' Juicy... but where is it!?!?!\n\nSERVICE:\nWhere should I start... So our server didnt introduce himself so i'm only assuming his name is Spencer since it was on our check which may not be correct since half way through another waiter assisted us. \n\nHe wasnt really friendly as we had to ask about pricing for everything.  I'm sorry, if I'm inquiring about pricing, wouldn't you assume i would like to be inform and you should be nice to let me know instead of me having to pull teeth????\n\nOur waiter talked my fiance out of ordering the XXX the first time around, which is \nfine and we took it as friendly advice.  However, when we got our Med heat orders we wanted something spicier, we asked if we can get a small side of the dry XXX seasoning so we can get more kick.  We were told he cant do that but if we wanted to order something else such a side order of corn, I can get the corn in a big soaked with liquid XXX sauce... great so if I want to season my food to my liking, you're going to make me buy more... right... This annoys me the most since he was the one convincing us not to order the XXX in the first place.  \n\nAnyway moving on... I ordered the Gumbo with Rice and I didnt get gumbo with rice.  The whole reason for going to Boiling Crab was cause I was craving rice with lots of sauce!  And what could satisfy my craving for saucey rice?? Gumbo! but nope, didnt even hit the stop.  I had to stop another waiter and tell her that I didnt get my correct order.  Instead of just bringing me a cup of rice, she takes my whole cup back to the kitchen and comes back with it...when i get my cup back, it looked like someone took 1 spoonful of rice and dumped it in.  I didnt realize rice was such an expensive item that I cant even get more than 1 spoonful.  \n\nSo after all this interaction, our waiter comes by and ask us how we were doing.  My fiance being the nice guy that he is says everything is great where I said things werent so good.  I'm pretty sure our waiter thought I was being sarcastic since my comment came after my fiance and it assume it was though \""oh its awful but i'm still stuffing my face that's its obviously amazing food\""... nope, I didnt say it like that or mean it like that.  He just walks off like nothing happened.  \n\nSo i'm writing this review a few hours after my visit to Boiling Crab... and in our group only three of us had their \""fresh\"" crawfish... and now all three of us arent feel so well.  \n\nThat sums up my extremely delight experience and will never stop back in that place and any of their other locations.  EVER.",0
"Really good, much better than any other food I've had at an airport. Had the I &O breakfast sandwich. YUM!",4
"What a horrible service experience! I went to return/exchange a phone case I bought for my son for Christmas.\n\nThe store clerk told me, \""We gave people until January 10th to return Christmas purchases and you are too late\"" When I asked if I could exchange or get store credit for the case I received a curt \""NO\"".\n\nI just finished completing returns at Fry's Electronics down the street with no problem and courteous behavior.\n\nI guess the answer to why Best Buy stock is way down is apparent. When you alienate a customer over a $15 return it can't be good. I have already told 5 people personally about this experience and will continue to spread the word.",0
"Finally got a chance to check out DW with my two fella, my mom and friend over the weekend. We came for restaurant week but were too enticed by the rest of the brunch menu, so we ended up ordering a la carte, all of us but my main fella that is.\n\nLocated in the old La Madonna restaurant location, they keep up the tradition of great food for this very unassuming strip mall.\n\nI ordered the Jamaican Style Omelet, my mom ordered the New Mexican Slow-Cooked Pork Omelet, my friend Ryan B ordered the Eggs any style plate with bacon and my fella got the Restaurant Week menu  and had the pastry basket to start, the Crab Benedict for his main and the dessert trio for dessert. We also all shared a ginormous slice of carrot cake to top all that already decadent meal off with. \n\nMy omelet was great. Fresh corn, New Mexican green chile and eggs. I grew up eating green chile and eggs and the addition of fresh corn was unexpectedly delicious. My mom's dish was amazing. The pork and chile were out of sight. I plan on ordering that again next time only with the rice instead of the egg. It was a bit on the spicy side for my poor mom so we switched dishes halfway through the meal. My fella's crab benedict was delicious as well. Good texture and very fresh. Everything here is so fresh, that I have to hand it to them for! The desserts were delicious as well. They were all light despite how rich and decadent they were. The carrot cake had fresh carrot and ginger shaved into the layers and the white chocolate shavings on top were my personal favorite. The spice levels were right on point and the portions were generous. The prices are actually pretty good as well. Definitely an A+ experience.\n\nThe staff was extremely welcoming and super accommodating. I look forward to my next meal here, hopefully I can check them out for dinner some time, their menu looks amazing!",4
"I stopped in for lunch on the wknd and there was one person working the entire room. She finally stopped for a minute to take my order after waiting at the bar for almost 10 mins and she told me it would be 15-20 mins which was fine with me since I had to run to the Teet. \n\nWell, 30 mins later, I am back and still no food. She forgot to put my order in and at that point I was starving and just wanted my gyro lunch special. They had a nice selection of lunch specials available seven days a wk so I'll give that to them.\n\nI got it and took it home. it was good but nothing to write home about. The lamb wasn't too flavorful and the tsatziki sauce was kinda weak. I would love to check it out again when they have a better service situation going on. I hear their hummus and baba ghannouj is terrific so I think I will be giving them a second chance in hopes of a better experience.",1
"On our first night, we went out to TAO nightclub. I got passes from my workplace which was valid for TAO nightclub, Tao beach, and LAVO at the Palazzo. We didn't have any issues getting into TAO nightclub. \n\nThe restaurant is located on the first floor. We went upstairs to check out the club only to find that only VIP seating was available. So basically you had to be a celebrity or pay a good amount of money to be able to sit at a table. Otherwise, you will be standing the whole night. \n\nWe just sat downstairs in the restaurant area and still had a good time. I loved the layout of this place!",2
Great breakfast spot!   Definitly will go there again next time I am in Phoenix,4
"Went in on a Saturday late afternoon, not sure if they were made the day prior but the 3 cupcakes my daughter and I got were all dry and even HARD on the edges. obviously stale. what a waste to pay $3 a cupcake for stale, DRY cupcakes.  so disappointed!.",0
"Yes, this place is pretty darn pricey but my wife came up with a great plan that saved us a bunch of money.  The main courses range in price from $40-55 or so and for two people to eat (with an appetizer and a few drinks) and the bill can get in the $175 or more range.  Instead of ordering two meals, we ordered 5 appetizers which were reasonably priced and more than enough food for the two of us.  It was a fantastic meal and we got to try a number of dishes without breaking the bank.  Sure, we probably missed out on an incredibly steak but we left happy.\n\nOnly reason for not giving 5 stars was the ambience.  The restaurant has all windows around the exterior and is right next to the sports book.  It was very distracting with 4 giant screens of horse racing behind my wife while we were talking.",3
"Where do I start!! This place is awful!! Service was very inconsistent, it took 45 min for our appetizer to arrive,which was sub par. It wasn't even busy just 3 tables occupied. \nI got the meatball and potato wedges and the wedges weren't cooked all the way through, and the burned the shit out of the garlic in my meatballs which left a bad taste in my mouth. Oh yea!! The owner parks his Ferrari right on the sidewalk out front the restaurant. Who does that? There was also a drunk cop with his wife who kept saying how good the food was. It was like a scene from a bad dream. They comped both our meals as we were leaving the owner was out front talking to the drunk cop about his Ferrari. Obviously this guy is in la la land, maybe you should sell the Ferrari and learn how to run a restaurant. Food is bad, waitress was sweet, but I'm not going back. I'am not exaggerating one bit. This place must be losing money everyday. Stay Away I warned you!!!!",0
"The Pink Hanger is yet another upscale fashion boutique in the Charlotte area. It's small, has some nice things but is generally very expensive and had nothing that made me feel the urge to make a purchase. The girls behind the counter asked me if I needed any help, and were doing their job, but were not very genuine, and did the whole \""up down\"" look that some girls do to other girls. Not very comfortable. \n\nThe sale section is very small and I didn't see any great scores back there. The one good thing I did like is that they had some unique under garments to get you through sticky wardrobe situations, like double sided sticky tape for your nips and such. They've even got a little nifty belly button cover for the preggers ladies out there.",2
"I loved the food, but thought the service was really awful.  Especially when they weren't very busy.  That really kills it for me.",2
"The ice cream was very good, but a bit spendy.  Of course, I did go for the sunday. Good portion size, good quality ice cream, and great toppings. The roasted marshmallow was a particularly big hit in our group, and the CSRs roasted it perfectly!",3
"This place has cheap late night eats... but its just okay, nothing special. I think you can get better late night cheap eats at other places. They have a 7-7-7 special that cost $7.77 and it's a piece of steak with a shrimp skewer, mashed potatoes and salad. The salad was DRENCHED in dressing... so the point of disgusting. I could not even eat it!! Literally half the salad plate was dressing, it was like salad tossed in soup. Ask for the dressing on the side!!! I'm warning you!! The steak was cooked properly, the way I wanted it. Shrimp was nothing special and the mashed potatoes tasted like real potatoes. I'm glad I tried it, because now I can see that all the hype is just a hype. I would not go out of my way to eat here.",2
"My first time at Grimaldi's ever, and it was terrible. First, the place wasn't really that busy, but my husband and I were told it would be a 10-15 minute wait. 20 minutes later, we were seated. After taking our drink order, it took our waiter about another 20 minutes to get my one glass of wine to me. For dinner, we ordered one large pizza to share and a small salad for me. After 30 minutes, the waiter stopped by for the first time since dropping my wine off to get my husband's Pepsi refill, at which point he mentioned my salad to the waiter. He looked at his notepad, and replied with \""Oh, that's right. Sorry about that, I'll be right back.\"" He completely forgot about it. About 10 minutes later, the waiter came to us to tell us the kitchen staff burned our pizza, so we'd have to wait another 10-15 minutes to allow them to finish the second pizza. My salad was better than the pizza. I don't know what all the hype is because I've had better frozen pizzas than what they made. To top it all off, it was half-price Tuesday, and we were charged full price for my glass of wine. My second worst restaurant service experience of all time.",0
"This recently remodeled hotel was perfect for our two night stay for a wedding. The rooms were clean and nicely decorated. The main lobby was very nice! The breakfast area was a little small, but I didn't eat in the lobby. I took it back to my room. We put the do not disturb sign up for the weekend- so not to waste the maids time. They were so awesome and they left a bag of clean towels at our door just in case we needed them! The pool looked nice, we ran out of time to use it. The only complaint I have was that the air conditioning was hard to control, it was really loud, but I think that was more my boyfriend's fault. I would definitely stay there again!",4
"This is my favorite Thai place in town. The decor is awesome and the food is even better!!! I've referred many coworkers there just for the take out food and now it has become a staple for many of us!\n\nSummer rolls with peanut sauce is delicious, I get them every time. \nCoconut soup was just ok, but maybe not my thing.\nBasil fried rice.. it has fried basil on top.. out of this world!\nAnd the Pad thai is excellent!!!\n\nThis was also a perfect place to bring my vegetarian friend! \nWe ordered tofu Pad Thai, just as excellent... you can get tofu in any dish instead of meat,\nand spicy stir fry garlic eggplant was FABULOUS!",4
"My husband and I made 5:30 reservations (can we say geriatric) for dinner in the Eiffel Tower so that we would have time to eat and watch the sunset before our 8pm show.  It's a lovely restaurant with a beautiful view of the Bellagio and it's dancing fountains.  We each ordered a steak and sides and a drink and relaxed.  \n\nWe were chatting so much that we were shocked to realize that it was already 6:30 and we hadn't seen or heard from our waiter in an hour.  Granted, we were busy conversing, but it seemed odd.  We asked another waiter to track down ours and 15 minutes later our waiter approached explaining that he had somehow forgotten to put our order in.  We were disappointed but understood...we asked if we should bother to have them put in the order...could we make it to the show in time?  We were assured that we could so we sat back and relaxed again...until 30 minutes later when our waiter told us that there was a problem in the kitchen and they had JUST started on our order.  We panicked.  A manager came and assured us that the meal was on the house and that we could still have time to eat.  Meanwhile I asked for a refill (which NEVER came) and when our food came we scarfed it down (so sad because it was good) and ran off as fast as we could to our show.\n\nI don't know what happened with us...it certainly cannot be the norm for this restaurant or else they wouldn't still be in business, so I hate to judge them too harshly.  They did take care of us and the waiter admitted his mistake.  It was just a little frustrating...a romantic, relaxed night out turned little stressful.\n\nWhen I am in Vegas next I would like to try them again.",2
"Came here as part of an event.  We were supposed to be on the \""VIP\"" list and when we asked where it was we were curtly directed to general admission.  The company who threw the event usually throws  fabulous events, so i think the blame here lays on Haze.  The bouncers were rude and yelling - i wasn't being obnoxious, just asked a question, and I'm local - not cool Haze not cool.  Unfortunately I cant comment on the inside because after being treated so rudely we ditched.",0
"You can get better \""Mexican\"" at chipotle, qdoba and etc. Maybe even taco bell!",0
"The food here is simply awful.  It's low quality and very disappointing.  I had a coupon to the place a few years ago and I was looking forward to enjoying some spaghetti, soup, salad, and all that other stuff you see in the commercials.  Nope.  Really bad stuff.  \n\nI've eaten at other Olive Garden's around the country over the past decade or so, and my experiences have universally been very bad.  In the realm of chain restaurants, I'd much prefer Chili's, Bennigans, Outback Steakhouse to Olive Garden.  Maybe chain Italian is just bad.  I also really don't like Macaroni Grill.  \n\nFor some people, it appears inconceivable that anyone could dislike the food here.  If you do - you're labeled a snob.  So defensive... tsk tsk.",1
Caesar salad was great. Everything else was ok. Wait staff is excellent. Disappointed in the food. Rigatoni ala vodka was bland. Chicken parm was very salty.,2
"I am going to join the not impressed minority on this one. Nice people, good selection, but their cake isn't much more than what you get at Basha's and it is a whole lot more. I priced them for wedding cake and they are some of the more expensive places on the west side. If you want a really special cake with a million details and cost is not a thing, go here. If you are looking for a good cake that won't burn a whole in your pocket- look someplace else.\n\nAnd just to clarify- I have had their cake at several functions and as I mentioned- not much better than Bashas.",2
"This Target offers a larger variety of the items in comparison to other Targets in the area. They have a constant rotating items of pet toys including holiday themed toys like pumpkin cat nip! I also like the variety of juices they offer in the grocery aisle. They offer Target pressed. Juice, Synergy, Naked Juice, Tropicana and more.",2
"(I'm half Korean, been to many K restaurants) Favorite Korean restaurant, it has the best service/food/price combination (in my humble opinion lol). It environment has modern pop Korean music, retro decor, and a young Korean wait staff (feels authentic). If you're looking for a more quiet traditional restaurant, this isn't the place for you. The music is on the louder side, vibe is for bringing friends and having a good time!",4
"Always clean, quiet. Great selection of DVDs and CDs. Great indoor/outdoor play area for kids.",4
"This place is disgusting. Ordered 2 entree's for $18 w/tax and the chicken was the worst that i've ever had from anywhere. It was burnt, fatty, and had bones/gristle.  Called to complain and the person I spoke to on the phone didn't seem to care at all.",0
They did a really great job!,4
"Absolutely AWESOME. They need to teach others (including the Tropicana on the strip) customer service. They really know what they're doing and took care of us every step of the way. I stayed there for a conference last year and am looking forward to the same conference this year which made the wise choice of re-upping with them to host the 2011 version. \n\nDo yourself a favor and stay a bit further out and just enjoy everything at the M. Great pool, nice casino, comfortable rooms (albeit a little weird modern design) and more.",4
"Can't really review, as they are not open until 7 pm, as their website states.",1
"I think I have been here before...Where is my review from that?  Who knows?  Anyways, we waited 20 mins for a table for 4 on a Saturday night at 7pm.  Not too bad considering the place was PACKED with people.  \n\nI wanted prime rib and they are OUT.  Bummer.  So I got the New York Strip with mash potato with cheese and bacon, and buttery corn.  It was good.  The bread and cinnamon butter is the BOMB.\n\nThe service was great.  Why the 4 stars?  How can you be out of prime rib?",3
"I give this LV 5 stars for visit #1 and 0 stars for visit #2, the following day.\n\nwhen I first entered the store to browse, I was dressed for the evening in a beautiful, simple dress and amazing shoes.  the next thing I knew, I had four salespeople bringing me clothing and heels.  I made an astronomical purchase.  the next day, when I returned to visit a piece I was considering, I was dressed down for the daytime.  no salespeople approached me.  I looked at the gown I had been seriously hoping to buy, then walked due to the disinterest of the staff, who took inventory of my clothing before mentally dismissing me.  big mistake.  I took my cash to Chanel instead.",2
"Salud was our welcoming meal upon arrival in Pittsburg, PA (not to be mistaken with  the Burg in the Bay Area). As we entered, the man behind the bar, formally known as the Bartender, took our order, served us, everything. It was a caucasian establishment, not tapped at the source, if you will. I had the Cuban sandwich and am not mad at all, it was on point. The lechon sandwich was almost just as good. Little to my knowledge, the same song played on repeat the entire time we were there. I guess all the years in Spanish clubs have made me oblivious to it. It all sounds the same anyways.",3
"The food lacks creativity and inspiration. \n\nThe wings were pricey $10/10 they were drumettes so they were kinda meaty. The wing sauce has an identity crisis, it's half Franks and half Sweet Baby Rays BBQ sauce, a lousy combination. My $10 burger did not come with fine shredded lettuce as the menu indicates it came with a flimsy piece of green leaf lettuce. The red onions were very scant, nor was I asked how I wanted the burger cooked. You can probably get a better burger at Dead Robin....The fries were dry and did taste like fish some. Her $13 Rueben had a shred or 2 of sauerkraut and the corned beef seemed to be rubbery like it was boiled all day and had no flavor at all. \n\nService was good and the place is nice. It's very unlikely we will return.",1
"Solid bagel shop, but a bit too sweet and some of the bagels were a little stale (not fresh?) and doughy.",2
"Excellent food and ambience here. The layout is welcoming and the staff is polite. They cater to most languages here as I sat at a table of 3 languages. I was with a Brazilian with a terrific taste for quality preparation and they met all his hopes. I was impressed with just about every selection I had and their medium was actually medium. Try everything here you will not be disappointed. \n\nAlso if you have the room, their tres leche cake is fabulous!",4
"The food was decent for fast food. The burgers were overcooked, but all fast food joints do that. No pink! The tater tots were saltier than I prefer, but edible. The service was quick and friendly. I have had lesser food and service quality before, but the new management sign made it worth a new try. I'll probably return at some time.",2
"For 17+ years I have been coming here when I need hardware stuff.  Almost every hard to find item I have brought in they have been able to get and most of it has been in stock.  It is nice to know, when I was married, I could send my wife in with a sample or a note and they could still fill the need.",3
"I'll keep this brief. The food really tasted great (kudos to the chef), but the service was very, very slow. Also, a bit pricey considering comparable restaurants.",1
"Like the fact it is open 24 hours.  My wife and went there over Labor Day weekend and had the shrimp app and a steak burrito. Everything was perfect, had enough burrito to share and take back to hotel.  Had no problem using the groupon.  Our server gave us some utensils to take back also.  Definitely recommend",3
"I never know what to expect from strip mall asian restaurants.  As a matter of fact, if this one hadn't come recommended by a great friend for whose palate I have the utmost respect, I would never ever stepped foot in this place.  But he has been telling me to go for months and when he invited me to lunch today, I took the plunge.  By the end of the lunch we had 4 sapporos, 3 appetizers and 4 lunches and got out of there for $23.00 per person.  \n\nThere were salted nuts on the table as an appetizer to warm us up.  We had friendly, quick and helpful staff despite the place being crowded.  We ordered the salt & pepper calamari, some ribs, and chicken wings.  The calamari was awesome. Just the right mix of salt, pepper and hot sauce or teryaki on the side.  The ribs were a little tough but the chicken wings were also perfectly crisp with just enough flavor.  The main dishes we tried were the flaming hot beef and rice, seafood chow fun and some sort of asian omelet that looked like an egg burrito.\n\nThe flaming hot beef and rice was perfect.  The beef was sweet with just a hint of the red peppers and if you wanted the kick, there were plenty of peppers mixed for you to bite into.  The seafood chow fun was lightly dusted with XO sauce giving it just a bit of a kick.  Swirls of calamari, talapia, shrimp and scallops were generously thrown into the chow fun.   The omelet was thin and heavily loaded with rice.  I had no room to try it but one of our biggest eaters could not even finish it.\n\nWe ended up stuffed and happy and looking forward to going back.\n\nThe prices are excellent with the most expensive lunch item being about $11.00.",4
"Aloha...\n\nMy fianc\u00e9 and I are burger fanatics. We've been all across the states and tried many different burger joints. \n\nCheeseburger las Vegas reminds me of a islands burger knock off with higher prices. We got the onion rings to start us off which were perfectly crispy. For our lung entree we got the Kobe burger (medium) and the kaluah pulled pork sandwich. \n\nThe Kobe beef was a big disappointment. Their was nothing special about the taste, texture of the beef.\n\nThe pulled pork sandwich came dry with a  pineapple coleslaw to use as a \""sauce\"". Overall the pulled pork sandwich was the way to go.  \n\nI would have given this place 2 stars but the overall atmosphere + color water fountain view = 1 extra star which ends up being 3 total.",2
"Outstanding service, great ambiance. Sushi is high quality.  We always enjoy the food and service. Tammi the owner is great and really goes out of her way to make sure everything is perfect.",4
"Tried this out though Groupon a month ago and had the garlicky shrimp which was fresh and the chicken wings which my fiancee loved for its crunchy texture.  Did not care for the sate sticks much but decided we liked the place enough to come back.  Got another Groupon offer and tried it out (more sober this time) and ordered the same shrimp, chicken wings and an order of king crab.  They brought us a regular crab order which looked liked the remains of someone else's order after they were done with it.  We told them this was not king crab and they regretfully apologized and said they had a new cook.  They returned with our king crab but it was not any better.  Had only a few pieces and not anything like the king crab order at Hot and Juicy Crawfish that served decent pieces of legs and claw.  The shrimp was not fresh and had a hard time peeling it which to me is a sign that it was not fresh.  \n\nAll this and we had to watch a video of Chinese propaganda played over and over again.",1
"We all have Cox because it is the only cable provider in the valley and I'm tired of it. CenturyLink only offers abysmal internet speeds, the highest of which is still slower than the slowest Cox can offer. While this may seem like a win for Cox, it is still a loss for the consumer. Cox's monopoly over the valley's internet means that they can charge whatever the hell they feel like charging you and also tack hidden fees on your next bill.  When I lived in Los Angeles, I had Time Warner, in which I was paying less for faster speeds, with UNLIMITED bandwidth up or down, and it was reliable to say the least. Excellent customer service and product.\n\nGoogle is charging only $70 for 1GB of bandwidth, granted it is only in select cities, and a very expensive on their part. Hopefully they roll out Google fiber optic into Phoenix, because it really needs new competition out here. If you don't know much about internet speeds, you are paying $70 for Cox PREMIER @ up to 50MB vs Google Fiber Optic same price, for 1000MB. I don't even think the average person needs over 50 or 150MB/s speeds, but we don't want to be giving up our first born child just so my computer can watch a 2 minute video at 1080p.\n\nThe sad part is, no matter how many reviews go on this, they are still the only place we can go, and it won't make a difference anyway.",0
Awful!  I should have realized when I walked past a table with 2 Dogs with only 1 bite in them.,0
I cannot say enough about this restaraunt! I took my mother there for her birthday and she left feeling special. The wait staff were absolutely wonderful. They were very attentive. We both ordered Halibut with a share of Lobster Mac and Cheese which by far is my favorite. For the sides we had the saut\u00e9ed spinach and grilled aspargus. Absolutely delicious.,3
"I'm going to be tuff on this place because it took the spot of my favorite Italian restaurant, Marinellis. The service was VERY slow, like ridiculously slow. The food was great though, fresh and the menu has a large variety. We tried about 5 items and by far the beef and broccoli was outstanding...the best I've ever had, tender and extremely flavorful.",3
"As someone who manages a rental property, I get pretty comfy with service companies.  I called Empire when for my own residence last year for air conditioning problems.  Essentially, the breaker kept kicking for problems that I finally found out a year later were purely a result of the breaker installation (not relevant) but Empire basically took our service fee, reset the breakers, and said it was due to inconsistent output from the AC unit and put a thingiemagie on there.  All I know is that it cost $250+.  It managed to control the problem until the end of the year by coincidence because it was the end of AC season and the AC was running infrequently.  A year later, I found out it's an electrical problem on the breaker and the fix they made was necessary and didn't solve the problem.   This is where my amnesia kicks in.  I completely forgot about all of this/my dissatisfaction when I called them again 16 months after that fiasco for my rental property.  There was a hot water heater leak and I needed someone to check it out/diagnose.  They said we needed a new water heater (which we do) and quoted us over $1100.  I did all this via phone from work because it's not my house and I had to remedy something quickly (while at work).  For the life of me, I could not get the technician to stop selling me the service package (Which is how I finally remembered it was them!  The company from a year before!  They won't stop talking about the service package before giving you a quote!) and just give me the #$*(@#$ quote so I could make a decision (at work, on the phone) about how to proceed with the pricey fix.   After interrupting and even having to be a little firm and rude, I finally got the price quote and let him know that No, I was NOT interested in the service package or what the water heater would cost me with the service package. I want to know what it will cost me.  Today.  By itself.  Whew.  So, I finally got the quote.  Way too high.  When I stated I thought it was high, I was again sold on how they could \""do it today\"" and \""the service package will save me $120 dollars!\"" Good day sir.  Here's your $29.99 service fee.  I'll call you tomorrow.  No, no, I won't.  I got Home Depot to do the sale of the heater, the install, and the take away of the old unit for $800.  It's my own fault, really... the amnesia.  My advice?  Write down every service company you shouldn't use again... somewhere.",0
"Mia (Sales Associate) is the best. She is extremely professional. Great selection, service and pricing. They carry one of every model made.",4
"Oh my gosh...this place sticks. Who are you newbs that are giving this place such high ratings? It's Taco Bell with a bar. Have you folks never been to Mexico, know Mexicans, ate at good Mexican rest? Yelp lets me down every once and awhile. The black beans seemed canned, the rice was dry and the taco meat was...well poor quality (see pic), I spit out as much as I ate. The chips and salsa were the highlights and they were average. Go to Si Senor in or Los Dos Molinos...trust me.",0
"Have not been back to this restaurant in years. Decided to try it again. The server Michelle was excellent- very attentive and extremely knowledgeable about the menu. We ordered the linguine and clam sauce as an appetizer- very good. The salads, that come with the dinner,  were huge. The breadsticks were served with 2 side sauces- they were ok. Prefer the olive oil and balsamic , which is on the table. Michelle constantly checked up on us . The one major  negative I can discuss is that the line cook definitely over salted the main dish- veal scallopine. I did mention it to the waitress, who stated that this line cook ALWAYS does that.  I guess if we go back again we will have to ask who is cooking. When we were leaving the restaurant, we did mention the overseasoning to the hostess, who just looked at us with a doe in the headlights look and did not say anything.  One last item- the menu is very limited but priced well.\nWorth a try but hopefully you are not on a low sodium diet!",2
"I really want to like this place because the service is very good...sadly the quantity and quality of the food is not...seems like I'm being up sold too.\nThe chicken taco was very dry and not big enough for a lunch portion on its own...had to add on the empanada to make it a \""meal\"". Empanada was tasty enough but served on a bed of lettuce seemed uninspired. Was charged for chips and salsa too.\n$8 for this lunch was too much",1
"Sadly I wanted to be impressed but I was not.  Being a vegan I actively search out restaurants that have a menu that is vegan friendly.  So today I had some time on my hand and headed to the heavily reviewed Red Velvet Cafe.  Disappointment was what I found.  The menu was a mixture of vegan, vegetarian, and non-veg, which is nice to see a restaurant trying to serve everyone but it is also its downfall.  Instead of innovating vegan or vegetarian dishes they seem to veganize they menu by removing the meat and replacing it with a vegan substitute.  Boring.... I ordered the flatbread with pesto and hummus, vegan style.  They replaced a parmesan cheese with a vegan cheese.  Yuck... It had no flavor.  Pesto should be distinguishable on whatever it is on and it was bland and looked like it was out of a jar.  It tasted like it too. The hummus was also bland and seemed heavily processed and not homemade.  The placed it on the pesto flat bread with a disher/ice cream scoop.  Seriously not an attractive presentation.  the only saving grace of the meal was the beverage.  I ordered the sangria sparkling tea.  Tasty and served with fruit floating it in.  Delish.  $5.50 a glass and no refills is a bit steep though.   Too bad...oh well I have my favorite vegan restaurant in Las Vegas and I am sticking with it.",1
"It's an interesting dessert place, opened pretty late (which is useful if you have a 'snack attack' while going out in the surrounding bars on Saint-Denis). \n\nAnd the portions are HUGE! Just to make you you understand that last point: HUUUUUUGGGGEEEE! Yeah, I can never finish my plate when I order something there. One tip: share your dessert with someone.\n\nOtherwise, their many variations of cheesecake are amazing, but it's always a 'hit-or-miss' for me: for every time I went there, the cake/pie would be awesome, or could be bland/tasteless. That's one of the reasons why I don't go that much.",1
i forgot the exact date of the initial service but it was early July. my phone wouldn't charge correctly. they soldered something on the motherboard and it seemed to work. 2 weeks later i had the same issue and returned to the store. they 'fixed' the same problem but broke my microphone on it. they had my phone from open to close and told me they couldn't fix it. they permanently broke my phone. i ended up going to tmobile and trading in my broken phone for a new one because i was going out of state for a week and needed a working phone. the owner said he would mail me a check for the repair cost and that was over a month ago. still waiting on that. he also refused to pay me for my out of pocket cost for the s3 ($200) that his shop permanently broke. i want $255 for the cost of the phone and what i paid the shop. this is not acceptable.,0
"This pizza was awful! I dont even know where to start, the tasteless cheese, the crust which was either stale or just cooked so much that you couldn't even bite it unless you wanted to break a tooth....\n\nThe service was bad. Sat at the bar which was empty, and watched the bartender keep changing channels on the television. He was apparently too busy to see we had drank all of our drink and offer us a new one and either decided to ignore us or forgot when we asked for extra napkins.\n\nThis place is lame.",0
The manager of this store thinks he's too cool.  It's obvious he hates himself.  Don't go there if you have any respect for yourself.,0

"Excited about my first dining experience today at the breadfruit at 108 E Pierce St downtown Phoenix. Learned about the establishment while researching  suggested restaurants from my companies vendor for a large group coming to town in March. Was told at 6:10pm that there was a two hour wait and that it's best to make a reservation before dining. Well of course I was not going to wait two hours to eat dinner. So we left. Then it hit me, the white couple in front of us that arrived at the same time wasn't leaving nor did they have reservations. Why were they staying and we weren't?!?! So at 6:17pm I called the restaurant from my car to make a 7pm reservation. The same person, Dwayne (who said he was the owner) told me he could accommodate us at 7:30pm. Definitely not two hours. Maybe my voice didn't sound Black like my face looked. What a huge let down!!! I will do my best to spread the word about my unfortunate experience at breadfruit.",0
"An Italian dive on Stanley St. In Montreal. Will let you know how that goes. The pizza is cooked in a \""wood oven\"" and just arrived and looks pretty damn fine. The pizza was good but not great. Returned a week later to have Veal Limonene, but that was disappointing.",1
"They get 2 stars because the food was actually good, but good lord...can we get some service...or at least have the waitress that is RUNNING all the other tables out side to serve us???\n\nThis was the first time in my life that I had ever stiffed a waitress on a tip...seriously.  It was \""cute\"" the first time we waited 15 mins for her to come back to our table and give me a root-beer instead of a diet coke, but it wasn't so cute when we waited 30 mins for her to come back and give us the check after that.  My friend and I had to ask other servers if they could assist us because the server assigned to us apparently just had completely forgotten about us.\n\nOh well...you live...you learn.  Good food, but the service was awful.  My friend that suggested the place has only good things to say, so maybe it was an off day.  I mean, it was a little busy because ASU was playing on TV, but the waitress handing every other table on the back patio was keepin' up and all her tables were taken care of...our server just had our table...\n\nMeh...",1
"Purpose of visit: late night dinner after watching the pacqiano fight. He was so robbed by the way. We decided to head to Chinatown for some Kate night Cantonese food. Joyful house is open late. We ordered salt and pepper shrimp with the skin on. A must try the shrimp were fried enough to make the skin crisp and you old eat it in one bite. Fantastic flavor. Salted fish in clay pot was a also a good choice. The tofu was tender and the fish slightly tender. The chicken and black bean sauce was good but was probably the weakest dish that we ordered from a flavor perspective. Not a spicy as they say it is. We also ordered fried Singaporean style noodles with seafood. Noodles were slightly crispy and the fish topping very tasty. Excellent place for quick, reasonable late night dinner. Decor is to be expected uninspiring and rather dated but you don't go there for the people or the atmosphere but for the food.",3
"I've been to this Quaker a few times. Every time I've been disappointed with the food and service. I brought a girl with me who just happened to like avocado an unusual amount. She ordered a sandwich with avocado, turns out they were out of avocado and didn't tell anyone. I had to ask. \n\nTo be a little more on the shallow side, the beer specials weren't that great and the wait staff could have been more attractive. \n\nDefinitely never going back especially with the Carolina Ale house right down the road.",1
"Greetings Yelpers. The sandwich here is pretty good. I took my sister here last night at 930pm. I saw a guy looking at us and getting ready to turn off the \""Open\"" sign. (I thought nothing of it at the time) \n\nAs we walked in the shop, I turned to the guy and said, \""Go ahead, turn it off. We are just ordering sandwiches.\"" The cashier simply smiled and just stood there. Some girl (perhaps one of the waitress) said, \""Oh, we are out of bread.\"" \n\nSERIOUSLY?!  It's not even closing time. It's a sandwich shop. \n\nVERY DISAPPOINTED!",1
"It had been a lot of years and I was thinking, you know, some questionable cow and fake horseradish sauce might just hit the spot.\n\nTheir signature roast beef sandwitch comes in 3 sizes: small, medium, and something approaching the size of your head. \n\nI think my meal had enough salt in it to pay a Roman legion with, but since the legions today are paid in Federal Reserve fiat greenbacks, the salt goes to Arby's. Maybe I'll try it again after I time travel into the future a few years.",1
"Hands down: one of the best things to ever happen to Las Vegas!\n\nI seriously got on YELP and was browsing through all of Island Flavors pictures because I miss the food so!\n\nThe orders for our party: Oxtail soup, chicken katsu, kalbi short ribs, and shoyu chicken. When those orders came out, my jaw dropped! The portions are huge! Everything was flavorful and delicious. I have a grand feeling that everything on that menu is just as delicious as the meal I had that night. \n\nNow, what really made me cry tears of joy was the kona coffee mud pie. That thing is huge! It easily fed our party of 4. The yummy coffee ice cream, whipped cream, oreo cookie crust and macadamia nuts was marvelous! \n\nThe service was also great! She was friendly and made sure to serve us with a smile. \n\nIsland Flavor, you won a place in this girl's heart!!",4
"My partner and I went for an early dinner.  We were inspired by reviews on Yelp and Echo Magazine.  When we entered we got escorted by the Host to a table for two and supplied with menus.  He was not welcoming or talkative, just doing his job.  Shortly after, came the waiter, who was hostile and obnoxious,  to take our drink orders.  He made no eye contact and seemed impatient to get our order over and done.  The girl server who brought us our drinks and the chips with salsa was the only kindness that we were shown throughout our short visit.  There was also a screeching child making the atmosphere even more unbearable. The chips and salsa were underwhelming and my Sprite tasted like it was dunked in toilet water.  I would have reviewed the food but the waiter never returned to take our order so we decided to pay for our drinks and go.  No one stopped us to ask why.  They just didn't care.  I don't know if their food was good or not but we know when we are not welcome.  It was one of the worst experiences we've had in Phoenix.....Manuel P.",0

"Chompie's is not one of my favorite places... Food is OK, I mainly think is overpriced...  Their promotions don't look that good to me, always have a lot of restrictions, and every time I go there I miss the points in the loyalty program because they expect you to enter your phone number when you just got the check and most likely don't have a pen, and servers don't seem to pay much attention to it... so if I forget I miss out...\n\nHowever we end up going here on occasion and  on Christmas day... I do not know about Jewish food so I am not rating how authentic it is.\n\nWe added a Potato Knish, which it was not like I remembered it... I kind of think they are usually 'shinier', but it was still good. (in fact I just went and checked the menu, and this was not 'golden brown')...I finally was adventurous and tried the small Matzo soup, I have never had it before and it turns out I liked it, I may have this again next time we go there.\n\nI ordered the tongue sandwich, and I was very very disappointed. It was very wimpy and it was higher in the center so the edges looked all empty : ( At that point I was happy I ordered the whole one because if I had gotten just half it would have been ludicrous... so, what I mean is that maybe it would have been a good $8 sandwich, but for $14 or so that was really overpriced. Also, when we got the check it said:\n'Tongue Sandwich, no cheese' and we were like 'whaaat? we could have gotten it with cheese?' not sure what was the deal about that...\n\nHubby had the baja chicken sandwich and we thought it was very good.\n\nOur server was Joseph and he was nice and friendly. \nService was not as prompt but I am OK with that because it was Christmas day and it was super busy.\n\nKudos to Joseph that got me a glass of water (with a slice of lemon) even though I had forgotten to ask for it. I am not sure if they do that all the time but I was  in fact thirsty so I am happy he did.\n\nI had coffee and hubby had iced tea. We did not have dessert and lunch was over $40 for 2 people, before tip.",2
"I finally decided too check out Ramen Sora instead of my normal go to Monta. In one of those wanted too try something new or mix it up. I had the miso ramen was very good. The broth had nice flavor too it and noodles cooked just right. Honest overall still rank Monta as the only place too go ramen in Vegas. Not that Ramen Sora is bad I will still go back feel like mixing it up or if Monta wait is too long. I love my gyoza with my ramen (tradition two together) and not notice it on the menu here plus no one compete with Monta gyoza anyway. They do have charzuka (sure spelled it wrong) bowl which I ordered like my side dish. The meat was very tasty seared on top bed of rice in small bowl. \n\nThe waitstaff is very friendly, courtesy, and greet you right when you walk in plus throughout your meal. The restaurant not very big I though Monta was small but this place might be just as small. The parking can be hassle depending time you go. Only ten or so stalls around the back of the restaurant then you would need too park on the streets. \n\nOverall miso ramen was winner but still have too place Monta above but whenever need get ramen fix sure Ramen Sora on my list!",3

"Planned a trip to Vegas for my 40th Birthday, and 25 of my friends decided to tag along. After several days and countless hours of trying to secure a reservation at this restaurant that was recommended by a friend, I was told that they could not seat us all at the same table-no problem and completely understandable, we are a large group. And I will have to have a preset menu to select from due to group size- no problem we will make due with that, we are a pretty easy going group. And I will have to sign a contract and put a 50% deposit down to hold the reservation- a little extreme, but again, no problem. The problem came when after all of this was said and done and HOURS spent trying to secure the reservation I was told that only 4 credit cards could be used to pay the entire tab.  Really, I am not a corporation we are jsut a group of people wanting to have dinner together. Well that is several hours of my life that I will not get back. I will NOT be recommending this establishment to anyone that may have a large group to coordinate. \nthanks for nothing, Lakeside. We took our business else where...",0
"Awesome restaurant with a separate vegan and vegetarian menu with just as many options as their standard menu! Tasty, spicy, and simply delicious!!

"I love this hotel.\nEvery year for the past 8 or so years, my dad's company convention was held in Las Vegas and he'd take us with him.\nWe always stayed at the Mirage and over the years it had grown into a magnificent hotel & casino!\n\nWhen I was young, I didn't pay much attention to the decorations or the things I could do as an underaged kid.\nBut this year, I realized a lot has changed, for the good.\n\nWe eat our breakfast every morning at the Caribe Cafe and it's always hearty.\n\nWe loved their Noodle Kitchen but apparently it closed :(\n\nTheir set-up for the Cirque Du Soleil show LOVE looks groovy and fun! It's colorful and very artsy. \n\nThe way the new Revolution bar/club looks really attractive however, i didn't get to go inside because I was underage :(\n\nThe other restaurants here like Craving Buffet, Fin, Japonais, BLT burger, California Pizza Kitchen, etc. are also yummy!\n\nThe Craving buffet serves breakfast, lunch, and dinner.\nFor dinner it cost us $24.95 each, i think. However, they label their sections to the types of food they have, like: Chinese, Seafood, Italian, Salads, Roast meat, Latin, etc.\n\nIf you're going to Las Vegas with underaged people, this place is great! It's also close to the major shopping places and hotels on the strip!",4

"If you're going to come here to gamble, I suggest you don't. There are other casinos here on Fremont St. that seem to make you feel more comfortable and not old fashioned. Well if you do like old fashioned, I guess this is the place for you. I can't really rate this place for how it is hotel-wise and staff wise, as I just come here strictly to walk through and eat at the Market Cafe. So my rating isn't for the hotel, but just the basic layout and how old fashioned it is. I know this place won't change the way it looks as they're probably preserving the looks of old Vegas with this place.\n\nI'm probably the only person to rate this place a 3 stars, so I'm probably missing something on how good the hotels are at this place. Sorry to say though, I probably wont ever experience staying at this hotel or any hotel in Vegas for awhile as long as my sister lives down here. All in all thank goodness this place has market cafe, otherwise this place probably won't exist for me.",2
"This place is so close to home that I really want to like it but there are just too many reasons not to.\n\nAs another Yelper stated the decor is nice post remodel and that is as good as it gets here.\n\nChips and salsa were brought to the table quickly and when my wife requested HOT salsa it was brought out quickly as well.\n\nPlaced our order..... carne asada burrito for me, fish tacos for my wife. They must be rationing fish in the kitchen.  Two tiny pieces in each taco which didn't fill the corn tortilla end to end. No flavor and not hot.\n\nThe carne asada burrito was small and the tortilla was like a firm paste. The quantity of tortilla outweighed the amount of carne asada. The beans were almost warm which puzzled me because the plate was very hot.\n\nMy wife asked for additional chips which never arrived to our table.\n\nWe were never asked if we enjoyed our meal. Im guessing that the amount we left on our plates spoke for us.\n\n5:30 on a Saturday night and the place is at 30 - 40% occupancy. I am pretty sure I know why.\n\nWe will not be returning.",1
"Jan's review pretty much sums up everything I feel. \nMy wife and I have been members for about 6 years. The new renovation was a joke. New floors and annoying disco lights in spin. Bikes still same old pieces of junk. Loose handlebars & seats. They are worn out and used up; they need to be replaced. And all the better spin instructors jumped ship and are gone.\nRecumbent bikes all have loose seats and no pedal straps. Wide screen theatre area has 3 seats! REALLY. Not enough weights and equipment for muscle classes. My wife has been waiting 3 yrs for promised additional weights. \nFree towels are nice but are now all ratty and feel like a steel wool pad. Time to replace them. \nMountainside, it's time to get your act together.",0
"This is a Spanish Tapa's restaurant that we stopped at on a Saturday for lunch, before heading to Red Rock Canyon.   \n\nThe decor is quite pleasant, and for a Saturday lunch it was not crowded at all.  The majority of the menu is made of small tapa type dishes.\n\nThe food was amazing and wonderful.  We shared 5 different dishes plus a dessert. Every dish we had was full of flavor and just so tasty!  With a rate of 5/5, I would imagine most the dishes on the menu would be quite good.  The service was also attentive.\n\nThe only thing that holds me back from giving it a 5/5, is that if I came here when I was super hungry, the bill would be far too expensive.  It is perfect, if you want a \""lighter\"" lunch.\n\nI would most definitely return for brunch or lunch.",3
"The service is hit or miss, either great or terrible. If you ask for soy it either is made wrong or has clumps in it.",2
Good beer although brewery tours are limited.\nBartenders need to be more attentive and more knowledgable on local beers,2
"I like the galleria, especially the grand foyer that makes walking into the office like a presidential entrance. \n\nThe facilities are well kept, and everyone who works the center is really friendly.",3
"Upon entering Vegas, we hopped off the shuttle at the Bellagio instead of our hotel stop at the Platinum (in fear it would take another 2 hours to arrive based on our driver's pace and navigation skills). We were starving, so stopped in at the first place we saw.\n\nWe got seated at one of the 50 or so tables in the center of the restaurant, and started perusing the menu as well as the interesting  dcor. Only in Vegas will you find intricate, ionic columns with keno boards built in the top. \n\nThere must have been at least 10 servers and workers running around us for about 20 minutes, until we had to flag someone down to order. (Maybe I should have waived a keno ticket in the air to get immediate service.)\n\nWe ordered the crab cake salad ($18) and the BLT ($14) a few beers, and...a $12 Bloody Mary. I have to say, it was a delicious Bloody Mary, complete with spicy homemade mix, lemon, olives, picked green beans, and celery, but for $12 they should have served it in the form of a miniature replica of the Bellagio water fountain, but with Bloody Mary contents instead for me to sip from...with music. \n\nFood was good, but it's hard to say whether it tasted top-notch because we were so hungry or if it was the real deal. But ingredients were fresh, the presentation was nice, and we cleaned our plates. Probably wouldn't return given all the food choices in Vegas, but still a viable option if you're here and hungry.",2
"I used to love this place- REALLY love this place, but will never return because of my latest experience. I absolutely love their green curry and order it every time. \n\nHowever, my last dining experience was horrible! The waitress wasn't very friendly, which I don't really mind because I'm there for the curry not the experience. I get my curry and find a hair in it! Gross, but I love the curry so much, I ask for another serving. Get that dish, eat it a bit, and find another hair! I told the manager and she looked around in the dish as if she didn't believe me. She was very apologetic and comped my meal, but I will never eat there again. The thought that there were two hairs swimming around in their pot of curry or the thought that they may have just taken my original dish and transferred it into another dish appalls me. I love their food, but I'm too grossed out to eat there.",0
"This is owned by the old original cook/owner of Tang Dynasty in Lincoln Square Mall. If you ever wonder what happened to the food there, it was this: the cook sold it and left. He's now opened a new place and the food's just as good as I remembered it. \n\nHad the dry-fried string beans, some stir-fried beef and mixed veg dish, the mix platter appetizer and some beef noodle soup. All were quite flavorful and tasty, and not too oily (something that happens often in this town with Chinese food, sadly). Could not stop eating the green beans, even my four year old liked them. For those who use this metric for their Chinese restaurants: every other patron there was native Chinese, both students and older folk. Parking is free, easy and plentiful. \n\nAs others have said, the interior is the exact same (they even still have the beanbag toss game out on the patio and the 'lucky' rock in the lobby from when it was Rock's) just with a bunch of tables thrown in but I'm sure that'll change as it gets established.\nThe serving staff was efficient (might have to point at the menu item you're ordering) and quick with the food, which was piping hot and obviously freshly made, and quite friendly with my son when he practiced his Chinese on them. \n\nAll in all a nice time, excellent authentic food, easy parking close to campus and convenient hours. Give it a try, you won't be disappointed.",3
"If it's being rated on it's food 21/2 stars\n\nIf it's being reviewed on it's club 1 star\n\nIf it's being review on it's drinks 31/2 stars. As obvious as this might sound, they really know their rum drinks here! Get a mojito you won't be disappointed. For the professional alcoholic don't miss the volcano! They also offer rum tastings...YUM!",2
"So the hotel is nice and new. The rooms are nice, modern. The pool is also great.\n\nHowever, be prepared for the maid waking you up (IN VEGAS!!!) at 8am to try and clean the room, possibly also sleeping in your bed while your not there, and also waking you up again at 8am on your checkout date, taking your clothing off your bed and throwing it on the floor, etc. \n\nOn top of this, you are far away from the strip and not really close to a highway that will get you close to the strip. Especially if you're climbing at Red Rocks, stay away from this place.\n\nThe ghetto hotels on the strip that you can find for $35 are much more worth it than this place. \n\nThe only good thing was the pool was open till 8pm and the parking lot is close to the elevators to the rooms.",1
"Horrible! My wife ordered steak med well, it came rare the first time, med rare the second time and well done the third and last time. My steak was fine, but the fries were cold. Service wasn't the worst, but with a meal that bad, who cares. And we still had to pay for the over priced screwed up meal. Won't be back!!!",0
"**sigh** I have a love hate relationship with Crack-in-the-box.  Oddly enough, I love their eggrolls and sourdough hamburger but try to not eat anything else! Unfortunately, they just added mini funnel cakes to the menu.  I had to try them.  Happy to report they won't be a new addiction.  \n\nMight see ya there.",2
The 1 star was for the food the rest was for the serves. I made the same bowl twice and it could not have been made more different by the cooks. Not to mention the fact they took my not even half eaten bowl while I was making the 2nd one. They say you go some where for the food you go back for the serves well I won't be back.,0
"Super !!\nUne tr\u00e8s bonne d\u00e9couverte ! La carte comporte des photos de chaque plat, ce qui permet de mieux visualiser ce que l'on va manger, et tout est expliqu\u00e9.\nVraiment tr\u00e8s bon, servis rapidement, et l'ambiance donne l'impression d'\u00eatre parti en voyage !\nNous avions pris une entr\u00e9e avec plusieurs choses frites, la friture est tr\u00e8s l\u00e9g\u00e8re, c'est vraiment bon ! Puis un plat de nouilles et un plat aux g\u00e9siers de poulets. Tous deux d\u00e9licieux !!",3
"I had a consultation with Dr. Davey in March for cystic acne. The visit was short and to the point. I was prescribed spironolcatone, which seemed to take care of most of the acne I was experiencing. I had a follow up appointment in June and was told my skin looked like it was better and I should come back in 6 weeks for another check up. He did not address the existing acne I was having. I got a call the day of my appointment saying they would need to cancel my appointment because the doctor was out of the office and they did not know when he was returning. I have tried calling multiple times, but the phone is shut off.  I am now almost out of my prescription and the pharamacy has not been able to contact the doctor for a refill. I was not reffered to anyone and I have contacted several dermatologists in the area that are all booked at least a month out. I am getting married in 2 months and if I am not able to find a dermatologist I am afraid my acne will get worse. I am beyond MAD!!!",0
"I saw the grand opening sign so I decided to get lunch. \n\nI wasn't feeling pho today, but I'm a fan of com tam and can be in the mood for rice all day, every day. I got a rice plate with Viet sausage, sliced BBQ pork, shrimp, baked egg \""casserole\"", fried egg ($9.50). Viet sausage kinda reminds me of a cross between spam and Portuguese sausage in texture. Sliced pork, baked egg and fried egg are all fine however the shrimp was odd. The seared areas tasted a bit of chemical...like it touched gas or lighter fluid. \n\nFood came out quick, the girl was friendly when I ordered, but there wasn't really \""service\"" per se. I had to walk up to the counter to pay since sitting there wasn't gonna get me a check nor a empty cup will get a refill. \n\nThey just opened a week ago so I'll see if they'll work out kinks and I'll try their pho to get a feel for their menu. I think it needs to be very good to warrant that they're a bit more than most pho spots...so far, it hasn't warranted the price with taste, quality or portion.",2
"Pretty good food, hard to communicate with staff, language barrier. Love the food here, never too busy.",3
"The worst indian food I have had waste of money,they don't even know how to make basic curry. Bhindi masala was a disaster, they used frozen bhindi and just put crushed cocunut on the dish. Also the lemon rice was one of the worst tasting rice dishes I've ever tried. It was hilarious because the manager was talking about each dish like it was too die for. But in reality, our stomachs were dying. I don't recommend anybody trying this place. I'm sure it will run out of business very soon",0
"We love their chicken chopped salad with basil & candied pecans. And the jalape\u00f1o fries are good too. I'm not a huge fan of the pizza, but my husband really likes the buffalo chicken one. The crust is too soggy for me but the flavor is good.",3
"I would give no stars but since I had to give one, one is all they get. After working with the loan department, I have decided to pull our money and move our mortgage. We were approved for our re-finance and then canceled at the last minute once they found out I was working a contract job. We have been a 20+ year B of A customer, currently have our mortgage with them and never have defualted. Yes i was laid off work like 1/2 of America but have managed to keep working a contract position. The contract jobs out here in California usually run for three months at a time and after each quarter, they extend them. I have been at my job since August 2011 and I am due to be extended at the end of June. However they used this as a reason not to go through with our loan. You think  Bank of America would want to help us make it easier to get through the economy crisis. Just to let you know I am speaking about the Loan Department in Chandler Arizona. Not only did they take forever to get the paperwork done, they called and told us to return documents as soon as possible so that our approved loan will get completed. We were told we could sign the paperwork while we were on vacation but never heard anything. Got home and found out they canceled our loan. Never will I use this Bank. Their commitment to customer service sucks.",0
Well laid out. Great selection. Decent clearance section. Friendly service. Helpful staff. Clean dressing rooms.,4
"Not a good place. Potatoes taste like barbecue potato chips, way to salty. Benedict was watery. Straberry French toast was good but that's it Not sure why the place is highly reviewed.",1
I decided to try this joint out since it's just around the corner from my house today. I ordered a bacon breakfast burrito with red and green sauce as I like to mix them. My first few bites were egg and grease only. Grease dripped out of the bottom and top of my burrito. Gross. Why I continued to eat I'm not sure. I hit the bacon in another bite or 2. I'm not even sure it was bacon... I chewed and chewed and chewed. I ended up having to spit it out (Sorry if that was TMI). I opened the burrito to check out the rest of the 'bacon' only to find the worst quality of bacon fat and pools of grease. My appetite was gone. From now on I'll drive the extra few miles to Los Favoritos which is 150% better quality and better prices!,0
"I didn't find it that bad, but it certainly wasn't good. It's a shame this place doesn't live up, because it's a neat-looking little diner in a great location. Service was typical Montreal aloof, food was not worth the time. Do yourself a favor and go to Cosmos down the street, or anywhere else at all really.",1
"Waited over 35 mins from the time we ordered our drinks until they brought them to us. Granted it was busy, but that's inexcusable for the amount you pay here. The waitress was really nice and apologetic but seemed as if she was helpless to fix the situation. \n\nThe food is actually really good. If they lowered their prices by 20% their prices would be more in line with the quality.",1
Best pork burrito I've ever had. Best airport meal ever! Hope to fly through PHX again just to get one!,4
Looks suspect however had good reviews so we are checking it out... Food was subpar there is a reason why the food is cheap....,1
"Came to a humbling realization of how arbitrary reviews can be.  Freak experience, random event, whatever..c'mon, it DOES affect our reviews... and apparently for me, temperature!\n\nGot a random assortment - scone, tea cookies, peanut butter bar, brownie, apple bar + loaf of bread.  Driving home in our warm weather and letting the goods rest on the counter, everything tasted ok.  Good but no-rock-the-world great... though the apple bar frosting was resplendent in vanilla flavor (yes, big word for big frosting!).  We just sampled thru everything and packed the remains into the fridge.\n\nFrom there, a magical transformation occurred... cold temps firmed up those heavily butter laden goods... the peanut butter bar and brownie elevated from enjoyable goods to luxurious pleasures.\n\nPS.  All my heart and stars, if nothing else, goes for love of MJ's Bread!",3
"I went in the other day to get my fishing pool re-spooled with line.  I had went there before and either the spooler messed up or the line was just bad quality.  Either way, the manager made it right for me, his name was Alex.  He let me pick out better line at a discounted price.  I didn't have a receipt, he was just working off of memory or good will.",4
"What an incredible meal I just had last night at Tuck Shop! \n\nAfter a long wait to finally try this place out, I managed to snag a table for four just a couple of days before we wanted to come by. \n\nFor starters, the team at this resto is probably one of the friendliest, most hospitable I've found in Montreal! The service was perfect: approachable but professional.\n\nTaking a look at the one-page menu I spotted starter items like beef tartare (a must), market salad, fresh burrata, cured salmon with homemade tzatziki, crispy pork belly,  just to name a few. Reading over the mains: Rib Eye steak, Ricotta Gnocchi, Duck Magret, Arctic Char, Hanger Steak, all served with fresh, seasonal sides -- a very tough decision! \n\nOur group decided to start with the Beef Tartare, Cured Salmon, and Crispy Pork Belly. Boy, did we clean off the plates! The beef tartare is served with a type of celeriac slaw and matchstick fries with aioli. Incredibly delicious! The salmon was oh-so delicate, served with paper-thin crisps and veggies, and the homemade tzatziki was just right. The Pork Belly (an obvious hit at the table) was out of this world! A cube of perfectly crisped pork belly served in a creamy morel sauce -- a dish that will remain in your memory.\n\nOn to the mains. Dishes ordered around the table included a 16oz Rib Eye steak, the Duck Magret, and Arctic Char. As I couldn't decide which main to order since it all sounded incredible, I let our waitress surprise me. \n\nThe Rib Eye was a beautiful cut, cooked to perfection (medium), and served on a creamy bed of mashed potatoes with a side of grilled Quebec Asparagus. I'm not a big meat lover but this dish was perfect! I could not say anything less about the duck that my friend ordered. It was served with a sort of fresh, citrus salad which balanced out the gaminess of the duck amazingly. Also, cooked to perfection. My first time actually trying arctic char, and definitely not the last, this dish was not lacking in taste. My surprise dish was their homemade Ricotta Gnocchi served with a very hearty vegetarian \""bolognese\"" sauce consisting of carrots, mushrooms, etc. -- meat was not missed on this dish! The portion was spot on as gnocchi tends to be very filling. Fresh shaved parmesan was a great addition.\n\nOf course, a meal this flawless must include dessert -- especially if said dessert is homemade by \""la maman de Theo\""! One of our party was celebrating a birthday. The waitress brought out an incredible platter of brownies, apple pie with vanilla ice cream, and a pot of (if I remember correctly) caramel cheesecake. We enjoyed these desserts with some dessert wine and porto. \n\nHonestly, this whole meal was so perfect and I'm certain that my dinner mates would agree. I cannot encourage anyone more to dine at Tuck Shop as it really is an experience -- from the service to the atmosphere to the perfect food reflective of what is in season....Go! \n\nI must add that I am a big fan of creative cooking with ingredients that reflect local produce and seasonal ingredients. All over each of our dishes we could spot in-season asparagus and fiddleheads (or t\u00eates de violon as they are called in French) -- loved it! \n\nPlease, do yourelf and someone special a favour and go eat here if you haven't been yet. And, if you have, go again since the menu changes often! \n\n(Note: I would say that the price range is about $$ - $$$ depending on how many dishes you order & wine. For our group of four with one bottle of wine @ 44$, four starters, four mains, dessert and digestifs, the total was about 80$/person w/ tip. I would have gladly paid more than that for the meal that I had! The dishes are well-priced as is the wine list.)",4
"I think this place would get better Yelp reviews if it were in San Francisco or Portland.  I guess downtown Vegas still gives people the expectation of cheap dive bars with cheap drinks.  It sounds like the Yelpers here don't even come here for the specialty cocktails which are awesome.  There is a classic cocktail revolution going on Vegas.  Hello???  I know y'all mostly work in the casino industry and are used to cheezy cocktails and come downtown for a cheap PBR or something, but hopefully more and more visitors and locals alike will find this place a refreshing change of pace from both the casino scene AND the gross, downtown ghetto-bar scene.  Even though I was not able to get inside the Laundry Room, no hard feelings, I enjoyed my time at the bar with David.  I don't tell people I write travel guides and Yelp just to get preferential treatment.  The upstairs dance scene is pretty cool, although it was hotter than sh t when I visited Vegas last weekend.  Besides Herbs & Rye, one of the best cocktail joints in Vegas if you're into cocktails and not PBR and a Jameson.  Seriously?  Not even hipsters are drinking that, maybe their younger sisters.  Seriously?  Even Reno has more and better classic cocktail bars than Vegas.  Shame on you 2 million folks down there.  Losers.",3
"I never have written an online review before, but I made an exception for this place. I have been here several times, with each time being beyond amazing! The combo of a fun atmosphere, and unique servers just makes the place a destination.  The whole menu is delicious, but the veggie burger is by far THE BEST EVER. My server was a beautiful girl with blue hair and tattoos. I can't rate this place high enough. I work in the downtown area and try to eat here as often as possible. SERIOUSLY EAT HERE!",4
"I was visiting a Celebrity producer friend of mine in Las Vegas the week of January 27 2011 and we were searching for a unique gift for his business partner.  We went into Kush Fine Art and encountered a extremely rude sale woman sitting at a desk talking on the phone. \n\nWe had already snapped a few pictures of some of the possible pieces we liked (to run by the other partners) and then... \n\nwe asked about these very interesting chairs they had...\n\nUs - Hi, what do you know about these chairs? \n\nRude Woman snapped: \""they aren't for sale\"". \n\nUs - O.K., \""do you know who made them?\"" \n\nRude woman replies \""they are very old, over a hundred years\"" \n\nUs - \""oh, I said, so do you know who made them?\""  \n\nRude woman replies \""no, they aren't for sale\""  \n\nI asked again \"" so you don't know anything about these chairs? (as I raised my cell phone to snap a picture of one)\""  \n\nRUDE WOMAN REPLIES \""can't you hear me? Do you speak english? No pictures, We want to sell the Art here! \n\nWell she didn't have to tell us again.  That last comment was heard loud and clear.  \n\nDEAR Vladimir Kush.  I'm glad that business is so good for your that you instruct your employee to tell customers to get lost instead of helping us and then taking the opportunity to point the conversation toward some of your pieces (which we actually were interested in and had some questions about) where we could have asked our questions and purchased an item. \n\nAs for the Rude Sales Woman, \""youngster, you better keep that job - because when the looks wear off, you have no class to guide you to or though anything better\""\n\nAs for the Art, well, no comment.",0
"Mmmmm delicious pizza at a great price.\n\nI got a pie last time I was in town will defiantly be back! Service was straight forward, just order what you want and come back in 10-15 minutes for the goodness.\n\nI ordered a medium (14\"") pie 1\\2 pepperoni 1\\2 mushroom for $9.10 ($7.50 + $1.60). Took a quick 10 minute walk and our pie was ready for us to grab a seat outside and enjoy.\n\nPerfect location to grab a bite to eat and watch the world go around.\n\nIngredients were very fresh, the cheese was delicious and the crust was nice and crisp. \n\nThey offer pies, hoagies and calzones... sticking to what they are good at.\n\nI will definitely be back to enjoy another slice.",3

"Never ever use Pitney Bowes for postage.  Their service is terrible, and prices are exorbitant.  And as for the leases, let me quote my attorney, \""This is the most oppressive lease I think I've ever seen, and I've seen a few.

"I am going to have to update my rating for the Buffet at Wynn.  As I have made my circuit to various other buffets I came to the realization that quality has dropped almost EVERYWHERE.  So Wynn still offers one of the top selections and quality, considering. They still have the best dessert bar of any of the other buffets in town.",3
I am thrilled that Yelp sent out an email with some healthy places to eat.  The food here is wonderful and the price is not bad at all. I got the pulled pork Fracos and Strawberry Freakin Frocc. Both were very good. The salad that came with the Fracos was amazing!  It also came with Kale chips in which the chef had said it's only cooked in olive oil and sprinkled with salt. The kale chips have so much flavor and they're interesting to eat. It's in the area where the DQ was in Town Square. It's such a small place but I hope it continues to thrive! I will be back soon!,4
"I spent a week in Las Vegas at the Hard Rock Hotel for NYE this year. It was not my first visit to Nobu, so we were very much looking forward to a meal there.\n\nAs always, it was fantastic. The cucumber martini was so very refreshing I am still craving it. The yellow tail sashimi with jalapeno has the best citrus soy sauce - we actually came back & got a drink & this dish again before we went out another night because it was so good & light. We also had the lobster tacos which were great.\n\nFor hot dishes, we had the rock shrimp tempura with ponzu sauce and the black cod with miso. Can you say melt in your mouth? This is the reason I return to Nobu again & again.",4
"Horrible experience, not family friendly, money grubbing, and dirty at the Plaza..  I booked a room for 3 nights in March for the weekend of 5/23/14 for a festival for my family (including 2 teens and a 3 year old).   The first night I got woke up at 4:30 am by a party next door (not a big deal), but I had my 3 year old with me.  I called room service and was on hold for 20 minutes before I decided I had to walk down (that was the big deal).  I was greeted by a disgruntled manager who looked as if I was bothering him, and who offered nothing but to have security go up and an explanation of, \""they were on break\"".  Really, in a large hotel like that they can't get someone to cover the phones at the front desk?  The next day they moved our room, which was good because it had a dirty shower curtain and writing all over the bathroom door as well.  Also, the ice machine on our floor was broken.  Also, they have no jacuzzi in the hotel, the rooftop pool has no shade and really cheap chairs, and was so dirty the whole time that none of us would dare go in the pool.  You couldn't even see the bottom it was so cloudy and dirty.  The sheets were soft, I guess that was a good thing.\n\nThey next morning I went to talk to a manager because I know night staff can be ...less interested in customer service than day staff.  This proved true, she was pretty helpful.  She offered a later checkout, a new room, a credit in their restaurant, and a fridge so I could keep the baby's drinks cold.    She said we could just leave the keys in the room and go when we wanted to checkout.  Good thing I went down to make sure the credit had been issued.\n\nMy issue was that they tried to charge me almost $300 on checkout for my kids, after I'd already paid over $320 for the rooms when I booked.  I talked them out of charging me for the baby, but it still brought it down to over $150 in additional fees after they put the food credit on as well.  I also told them I had purchased a room for 3 nights for my friend and that she never made it.  I asked them to remove the $20 per night fee for each teenager since she my friend never came and I paid for her room on my card and showed them the confirmation email!!!!  It was for two people and they were charging me for 2.   It was supposed to be an affordable family fun vacation, but the only good part was that my cousin was staying at the Golden Nugget and got us in to their amazing pool, where we spent each day and had a blast.",0
"Usually I wouldn't give a 5 star for somewhere with pretty good food. However the atmosphere was nice and beach-ee, and for the price its good food. They have a full bar. \n\nMy boyfriends burger was really good, very well seasoned. I switched out my burger for chicken on mine, and it was really good and light, compared to a burger. The waitress knew the menu and actually suggested that I switch the chicken in the burger, since I couldn't decide between that burger or a chicken sandwich, because I wanted something lighters. There are tvs, which I generally don't like but they are all at the bar, and they also had one of the on a surfing and ocean channel, which was nice since the theme is islands. \n\nThey had nice outdoor seating. \n\nThe Hostess came to the door and opened the door for us it was extremely inviting and just a really nice touch. Even the other guests were very friendly. \n\nThis is definitely going to become a regular place for us, we both loved it.",4
Good location if you need to be downtown LA. Service was excellent and rooms were spacious and clean.,3
"This is an in-between 3 star and 4 star rating so I'll tell you...\n\nWhy 4?\nLocation, location, location.  I could be in a little hut anywhere near Camelback Mountain and feel relaxed and peaceful!  Rooms were impeccable, bedding some of the best I have seen and felt, great downturn service (bedroom slippers, chocolates, soft light, soft music playing and of course the bed down turned).  The whole place is constructed with that great solid brick, therefore you don't hear your neighbors.  Lobby was very warm and inviting (very impressive considering they are going through renovations and had to relocate lobby...can't wait to see what the permanent one is going to be like).  Frozen grapes served by pool concierge while laying out... really hit the spot.  Filtered H20 with fresh lemon slices at your disposal.  AND...they allow you to take your drink into the pool with you, very cool.\n\nWhy 3?\nWhen you are really looking forward to eggs benedict in the morning (especially after a night out on the town), and you get them and the yolk is completely SOLID in the center, well...let's just say the great music that was playing in the background of my brain since I arrived  came to a screeching halt, like a needle over an LP (ok, ok, I'm showing my age...).  My husband's Marriott burger was good though and the food was served fairly fast considering it was room service.  Also, the pool is very small and they don't have enough floaters for everyone.  Kind of a first come first serve thing.  \n\nI am anxious to see what is done after their renovations and can't wait to go back which is why I'm giving it a 4 star rating even though there were some disappointments.\n\nps.. there is no lazy river here at this hotel...never had, never will...other reviewer must be talking about JW DESERT RIDGE...hello..",3
"At first they're standoffish and a little reserved, but I think it's having to deal with some of the fussiest jewelry designers and metal artists in the Valley. They try to assess you as you walk through the door and try to anticipate your type of personality...that's a good thing.\n\nWhile it may look like a hole in the wall or a place that won't carry more than an ounce of silver, Lonnie's Inc really has so much more going for it....whether you're into enamelling or beading, this place is it.\n\nI miss their other location out in Mesa, but that got closed down last summer.\n\nFor now, I make the drive to Lonnie's in Phoenix and each time I've gone, I've yet to be disappointed.\n\nThe staff is friendly and knowledgeable.",4
"I visited Charlotte for the first time last weekend and wanted to finally do the BC after transitioning for 7 months. I was greeted as soon as I entered the shop, I filled out a form with some of my information and sat in the waiting area. The shop is very clean, each room was painted in beautiful colors, very airy and excellent background music added to the ambience. I didn't like having to wait for an hour to get my hair done. I was told that the shop was supposed to be closed that day due to it being a holiday week (4th of July) so I attributed the wait to that reason.\n\nGracie styled my hair. She listened to my concerns about the BC and gave me advice on haircolor. She did an excellent job on cutting my hair. No razors were used for my BC just scissors and the shape she created with the cut was excellent. Gracie was patient with applying the color and made sure the color completely saturated my hair. I got a reddish/auburn toned demi-permanent. \n\nDoing the BC at Naturaltress Salon was the best decision for me. A BC can be a very frightening experience. Once I received my BC with Gracie I felt confident I could style my hair and embrace my natural hair journey.",3
"Decent food that was just down the street from the hotel where I was staying. I got the ravioli entree and it came with garlic bread and salad. They could afford to spruce up the house salad a little bit, but the raviolis were tender and pretty good, even if the sauce left something to be desired.\n\nAttentive service and plenty of seating indoors and outdoors.",2
"Birthday dinner!  Poutine Fries and Suicide Fries, \""Fricken Huge\"" is a lot of food and a great price.  Pizza was pretty awesome too, the cheese was real and the sauce was very tasty.  Because my son was 18 we couldn't eat in the bar but we had excellent service next door at Desnudo Tacos.",3
Decent free show for adults and kids to see.  Need to get there early so you can see well.  Otherwise the crowds will obscure your view somewhat.  Gets hot if you are right next to the fence!,2
"Went there on a Friday night for dinner. It's In a strip mall on lake mead . From the outside it looks like a cheap Chinese restaurant with all the led signs. Had second thought for minute but gave it a try anyway.\n\nGot inside the door and again the inside looks like a cheap Chinese restaurant the decor is horrendous hard wooden chairs.\nCommon you can do better than that!\n\nOn the sushi side the food was really good    Fish was fresh and was not drowned in sauce. Three stars are only for the food. Decor gets zero in my book.\n\nI would only stop in if I was in the area for a quick meal, definitely would not take a date there!",2
"I can't begin to say how amazing my evening was tonight. My family and I enjoyed the food, service, and the whole experience. The staff made it enjoyable, Laveda was an amazing server and personalized everything for what we were celebrating. I would recommend this restaurant to anyone looking for an amazing time with friends and/or family. \""You can't find amazing food like this anywhere\"" a quote from my uncle!!",4
"I'm definitely a fan of the food, but not a fan of the wait! That being said, unless you're an early riser, be prepared to sit OR stand because their waiting area fills up quick.\n\nOn to the food, breakfast specifically.....\nIt's your typical favs....

Usually when the thought crosses my mind, it's far too late in the day to go because I know the wait  will be the death of my blood sugar!  =(",3
"If you are gluten free, BEWARE!  Do not be fooled by the gluten free menu.  There have been a number of gluten free diners who have gotten ill after eating here, and at least two (that I know of) who believe they have been served gluten after ordering gluten free.  If a restaurant is going to offer a gluten free menu, then they need to ensure that their staff is trained.  They need to show clear evidence of cross contamination procedures.  Our family used to eat here regularly and we finally gave up.  It wasn't safe for us.   We now eat at Tott's, which doesn't have a gf menu, but has been very accommodating.",0
"This is my first visit to TGI Fridays at this location. Kinda surprised it wasn't added to yelp.com. So I did.\n\nEvidently it has been here operating for a couple weeks. Kinda surprised that they didn't have NTN Buzztime trivia to enjoy. Friendly staff as always. \n\nFood was good. My steak was ordered MEDIUM. It arrived WELL-DONE. So it went back and was cooked properly the second try. The other the meals and appetizer was prepared properly and was highly enjoyable.  The server initially had a hard time keeping my coca cola full.  Had not my steak went back, they would have received 4 stars. Because service was just OK...just an average rating they receive.",2
"This club sucks so much ass just went yesterday it's so small and overcrowded no place to sit and the bouncers are all fucking dicks no respect they scam you for $20 while your in the line(Fuck them I didn't pay) just so you can cut a few feet in front and wait in another line for\""VIP\"" which is really the general admission line and that's only for guys if your a girl and have a belly they wont let you in only the hot chicks get through. I saw many chunky girls get turned around and denied entrance that shit was fucked up the drinks are exaggeratedly prices $25 for a jack and coke $17 for a lemon drop I highly advice everyone not to go to this rip off of a \""club\"" I know I'll never come back again",0
"Went in cuz I saw a $25 pedicure sign out by the road... bit of a bait n switch there.  Once you get in, have your pedicure and go to pay, they ask for $30.  Apparently, the sign out front advertises the \""member pricing\"" but fails to say that on the sign and the staff fails to mention that on the phone, even when you say \""I saw your sign at the corner and decided to come in.\""  When I questioned this, I was told I could buy the monthly membership and receive that price... ehh, I'm not a fan of that business approach.  Being that I went in their for those prices advertised, a much better response would have been to give it to me at that rate in the hopes of gaining a customer.  But that wasn't what happened... Anyways, the pedicures were fast (one manicurist did me and the bf in 35 minutes!) and nice, but I do a really good job on my own toes at home and don't see the value in paying someone $ to do just an okay job.  \n\nI do like the decor of the place. It was comfy and their products aren't the smelly kind that leave you feeling buzzed.  I feel that $30 for a quickie/express pedicure is about $10 over-priced though.",1
Super expensive takeout for really dry food. Takeout 2x and always the same problem..Feel like I could buy all ingredients and make it better.,1
"What's the difference between this Carnegie Deli and the other reviews page?\n\nI didn't get to try this place in NYC but here in Vegas, you can get any kind of food imaginable from anywhere. Anyways we were stuffed from lunch so we picked up something to go later in the night. One sandwich could easily fill the bellies of two. But since we weren't that hungry, we ended up with some leftovers. Luckily our hotel had a mini fridge and we were able to save some for the next day. We ended up with a pastrami sandwich. I was eyeing their most famous corned beef and pastrami combo sandwich but just thinking of the size of that and at $20, I just couldn't do it. Although the plain pastrami was already $17. Sandwich was fixed up pretty quickly and we were on our way. Oh and we got a choice of breads but  stuck with the typical rye. Man the 'wich was huge. No way could the height of it fit in my mouth.  But wow, really flavorful without being too salty. And moist too. Some fat in the meat too which is bad for my health but makes it takes oh so yummy. A lot of deli's have either really salty pastrami or dry, no flavor meat. This was a good balance. It also came with the necessary (two) pickles and the pickle really helps with a different texture and taste to break up all that meat you're devouring. Wow, not sure I could part with almost 20 bucks for a sandwich all the time but this hit the spot this one time. And you should splurge every once in a while, especially on vacation.",2
"Went in for a table of three plus a baby. Very helpful weight staff ended up recommending all of our dishes. The Margarita was great. The Mexican food was  quite good. I would recommend it as a family friendly, tasty Mexican restaurant.",4
"Hector's is a nice place with a bit of funkyness to it, in the heart of Stockbridge.  \n\nIt doesn't try to be trendy, but to a certain extent it achieves it, and I like that.  During the afternoon it's a relaxed place where you can come for an interesting pint, a bite to eat (though they make their nachos with fried flour tortillas... I found it weird) and a quiet chat on one of their funky (and somewhat in need of re-covering) sofas.  On the weekend, it's buzzing and packed to the gills with a professional crowd.  Even packed, the bar staff have the uncanny ability to recognise who's next to be served - a skill which is very praiseworthy.  \n\nI think Hector's brings a bit of quirk and soul to Stockbridge and provides an excellent alternative to some of the more mainstream or traditional bars in the area.",3
"It was awful!  Cold pizza, the wings were not good either and it was $39 for a large one topping, two liter of soda and 8 wings, so pricey as well.  I ordered it at 4:45 and it was delivered at 6:19.  I will not spend money here again!",0
"It's not enough to say they have the best happy hour in North Scottsdale - and, oh, they do - let me tell you why.  First, the place looks so good it makes even me look good in it.  The entrance is a long walkway surrounded by floor to ceiling windows behind which are hundreds of wine bottles stacked, well, floor to ceiling. The staff all ooze cool while at the same time executing some of the most solicitous service I can think of in town right now.  Their signature cocktails are amazing, and their bartenders know just the right way to make them.  At $8 a pop during HH, that's a mighty fine deal for top shelf liquor done right.  Food is $7 on the HH menu, so of course we tried just about every one, and they were outstanding.  Ok, I have to fess up, the lobster mac & cheese was really boring, but that was the only boring thing this evening.  I guess they have live music some nights, and I hear they're thinking about offering bourbon flights.  Bourbon flights??  That's a bit beyond my league, but it could be fun to watch.  \n\nBest of all, Bourbon Steak's HH goes until 7, which gives me plenty of time to fill up on the value menu and still get my old butt home in time to crash at a decent hour.",4
This if for their driving not food.  You cut off a bunch of people as you ran a stop light! Glad i was further back... Im sure it wasnt that important for you to do that.,0
"Got the kids together to go out for Ice cream.. what a disappointment! Walked in and all of the ice cream was melted to the point of foamy on top. I asked the clerk about it and he informed me that the freezer had broken earlier and now working again.. I asked if he would be willing to pull fresh frozen ice cream out for our order and he gave me a big sigh.\nThose ice creams should have been dumped and replaced immediately upon melting. Instead it was as if they were trying to \""refreeze\"" them.. it was separated and foamy. Disgusting!\nNeedless to say.. we settled for hot fudge sundaes from mc d's.",0
"One of the coldest days in town so I was looking to warm up. A ramen place on the east side of town, interesting and exciting! I went in ore one thing and one thing only, miso tonkatsu ramen.\nFood came out quickly so I jumped in to get the chill out of my bones. Slurped through the tasty broth then took own h pork and noodles. Definitely a good bowl of ramen. Can't wait to plan my next trip.\nThe servers were very friendly and made several visits to our table to make sure were satisfied. Yes we were!!",3
"I was running errands today and decided I was in the mood for a lox bagel with all the trimmings.  I stopped by this location and  snagged one to go, along with an iced coffee.\n\nThe service was prompt and courteous,   I was impressed tby the ability to pour a cold coffee that didn't instantly melt my ice cubes!  The lady behind the counter even gave me a choice of to-go cups, which was a nice take on service.\n\nMy bagel was nicely constructed.  Care was taken to layer the cream cheese, capers, and tomatoes.  The lox was really plentiful, and of high quality.  \n\nPrevious reviewers have given this location low marks for service and cleanliness but I had no issues with either.\n\nThe location itself is challenged by the ongoing lightrail construction.  The store is dark-ish but ambience is not a key factor in a place that is designed for takeout or quick to-go orders.\n\n\n\nUltimately, this places delivers good food at reasonable prices.  Give them some love, especially during this construction period!",3
"This place was recommended by a colleague of mine so I decided to take my parents and my significant other out for dinner there. While the service was friendly, our server was also forgetful. We found it odd that our guacamole was served without chips. When we asked for some, they were also forgotten. The carne asada was overcooked, my dad had to return his because he couldn't chew it. The manager did come over to apologize and took it off the bill and paid for my dad's meal. The food actually lacked flavor and I didn't find anything distinctive about the entrees. While I don't mind loud music, it was difficult to carry on a conversation. We will not be returning.",1
Do not be fooled by the outside appearance of this hamburger joint! This is the new place to eat! Burgers are huge and tasty. I love this place and will definitely be coming back for more. The inside looks a little empty like it needs some decoration or a special touch of some thing but the food is what counts.,4
"Jalapeno's has a fun atmosphere, good outdoor seating, good service, and pretty decent Mexican food. \n\nThey had great fresh salsa with a mix of chips. I ordered a combo platter with a shredded beef taco and a green corn tamale. Both were very tasty. The tamale was a tad on the dry side, but still above average. The beans and rice were okay. \n\nThey offer a variety of margaritas. Our very attentive server insisted that a margarita called \""The Boss\"" was the best one. We ordered them and they tasted like tequila with some lime. Too strong for me, but it was popular with the guys. Much to our server's disdain, I ordered a *gasp* blended margarita. Much better and easier to enjoy. \n\nI wouldn't go out of the way, but if you're up north and craving Mexican food, Jalapeno's is a good bet.",2
"Went during restaurant went for the 1st time. Excellent service and food. Party of 6 and everyone enjoyed their selections. Some ordered off the QF menu and others ordered from the regular menu. The braised curry lamb shank, the kangaroo, filet and lamb chops were the items ordered. My lamb chips and the risotto were excellent. I tastes the kangaroo---a bit gamey for me but it was ok. The lamb shank was also very good. Desserts were good as well---chocolate torte, creme br\u00fbl\u00e9e, and strawberry shortcake---all were great. Nice wine selection as well. Definitely a must try restaurant!",4
"Well the super secret door by the dumpster behind the restrarant leads you to tiny room with pretty impressive coctails.  Be prepared to wait, at the bottom of the stairs, at the door and once you get in.  The service is not fast, this is not a place you go for quick drinks or with someone who can't hold a conversation.  It is a place to go if you want to try one of a kind, handmade cocktails!",3
this place was awesome the only reason it got four and not five is for the simple fact that it could have been better. this is a place you need to go as a group and get rowdy. as loud as possible. for some strange reason it looks like the guys that are in the show also do porn. they have that look. one of them looked like evan stone. but yeah do this shoe and buy your toy swords and drink it up.,3
"Had dinner at a regular table, not the usual cooking table. It was very dissappointing. Portions were definitely smaller than when cooked in front of you.  Soup and salad were delivered at the same time. We were still eating them when our entrees came. Our salad plates were removed with food still in them! We were not asked if we were done.  Unfortunately the food was already lukewarm--and our silverware was removed--it  was totally cold before we could get silverware. I ordered my steak medium rare--it was quite well done. When i mentioned this to the server she said \""there is some pink on there\"" It was not offered to replace.",1
"I have experienced better, actually.\n\nI mean, just walking this place and you can feel something is missing. It for sure needs renovation.\n\nIt's really not fair. This place opened in the 50's and you can tell it's iconic and has had many stars and amazing people walk through it's halls.\n\nHowever, time has clearly passed this place over. The carpets are stained and dirty, the casino feels outdated. Even the shows don't seem to call to me.\n\nI've made a conscientious decision to plant my ass in the hotel where I'm staying at (that's the whole point, right?) throughout my weekend trips; and so I didn't linger anywhere and stayed put here.\n\nUpon check-in, the clerk gave us the wrong room number. We had some girls come with us in a different room and they gave us another horror story of a rude check in clerk.\n\nWhen I tried to watch TV, I kept fiddling around. Found the porn channel and they were charging over $12 to view it. No thanks. Internet porn is free. Thanks.\n\nSo after roaming the casino, I found a bar that seems to be the reason why I gave this place an extra star. $1 beer. That's truly something special to have.\n\nAs for everything else. The food court is dismal and one friend told me the service was horrible at the Indian food place. The Banana Leaf Cafe was horrible as well. I didn't even bother with any of the shows because none of them appealed to me, unfortunately.\n\nThe R Steak restaurant was the only saving grace here as well. The only gem to be found and clearly a reason for you to visit the Riviera.\n\nThe pool was pretty neat, up until I went by the 3-ft area with the stairs to climb out and found a bunch of debris and a floating Corona cup. Not quite cool.\n\nTo make matters worse, my final night I ended up taking a walk towards Encore/Wynn, a hotel who clearly over-shadows the Riviera by a long shot. Upon entrance I can spot a difference IMMEDIATELY. There were so many beautiful women walking around and even if you took that away, you had people walking everywhere, it got so full at one point that we  almost got lost in the midst of it all.\n\nTheir nightclub 'Tryst' has more swag than the whole of the Riviera combined. And I HATE the word Swag.\n\nFinally going back to my hotel in the wee hours and I just felt deflated. No nightclub to speak of, no night-life. Just old folks gambling.\n\nWhich brings me back to my original notion. It's not fair that an older establishment like this should be compared to by other more modern casino's. There is a certain charm to this place that should be absorbed. Unfortunately, in this day and age, I don't think that's enough to stay on par or ahead of the competition.",1
"They just don't take no for an answer.  You better think twice about giving this company your email and phone number.  \n\nI wanted to inquire about prices for a family of four and in order to do so, you have to provide an email and phone number.  Big mistake on my part.  After a couple emails back and forth, I finally got a quote of $443 for the first month, and $344 a month after.  Are you kidding me?  Imagine what you can do with that.  You can literally lease three high end pieces of gym equipment in your own home for that.  \n\nAfter saying \""No Thanks!\"" you would think they would call off the dogs.  Nope.  They get even more aggressive.  Even downright rude!  You will get calls from sales in the corporate office.  You will get calls from sales at the actual gym.  You will get emails asking what time can you come down tomorrow and tour.  You get emails insinuating that you would be making a bad decision for your family if you didn't join.  \n\nThese guys are like Larry Dallas from Three's Company.  They just don't take no for an answer and then start to get sleazy by becoming passive aggressive.  \n\nI thought that if I replied to the corporate sales person that I was moving out of state, far from any Life Time gym, that would end their campaign to sign me up.  Nope.  Did not work.  They called and emailed yesterday.  I had to block the number and set my Gmail account to mark all mail from the company as spam.  \n\nThe whole sales process ruined this company for me.  The astronomical membership fees are off base with any other facility in area.  \n\nIf you intend to make this place your home away from home, maybe it's worth it.  But if you are looking for a place just to workout, take a few classes, and maybe swim a few laps, this is not going to be the place for you.",0
"Buffets should end with you smiling and patting your belly, after having unbuttoned your pants to fit in one last round. When u find yourself at your table sharing the same look with your friends: that blank stare out to nowhere, playing with your food and wondering why you didn't spend that 25 bucks on the Monopoly or Sex and the City slot machine or all red, you know u ain't happy. \nWhat sucks is that, we came here as our last hurrah lunch before heading home, having eaten many delicious meals- we were pretty disappointed.\nI should have listened to my gut feeling after seeing rates of this place dropping in their latest yelp reviews.  It wasn't unsavory looking as the lower end \""buffet of buffets\"" buffets, but it certainly made me wonder what i would be getting if i spent that 40 bucks for dinner on a peak day. Would it be that much better? Or more of the same stuff... A whole station devoted to tortilla chips with only red and green salsa was a bit of a turnoff. \nThe dishes i did enjoy were some pork slider thing, leek dumpling, bacon, and hashbrown ball. They had a small selection of Thai and indian food which you dont' find everywhere- but they were ordinary.  What we found ourselves doing, was mixing up some of the dry dishes with the saucy items to make things more interesting... eating our cookies with the icecream or frosting off the cupcakes. The mini cupcakes were cute http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/2weQS-RnoOBhb1KsHKyoSQ?select=uJVqblRmMmvsl3P6pkU_KA, frosting was ok, but i am not a huge fan of glitter on my cupcakes. but since we were in vegas, where glitter is a common accessory- i ate it anyways.

I haven't been in to this location for some time.  They have done some remodeling and the employees are very friendly especially a server named Susan I think.  The place was very clean and the food very good.  I was very impressed and the price was great for all I got.  I'll be back!,4
The reason I'm even giving this place 2 stars instead of 0-1 is because the drag show was pretty entertaining.The Bartenders are amazingly friendly and around 11 they have a $10 well all- you- can-drink-all-night special. Aside from that... WOW!!! \nHOLE IN THE WALL in a crusty neighborhood next to a strip mall. I wasn't expecting much after perusing the reviews left on Yelp but I really didn't expect to be walking into a smoke filled nightmare. funny thing was they actually had a VIP section. i'm kind of ranting here but it's because I can't wrap my brain around how horrible the place is. It's like going to a garage party when you were in High school but take away the hot guy you had a crush on and replace him with the 8th year senior that's at all the parties. \n\noh and i had to do laundry after because EVERYTHING i was wearing smelled like the carpet in the suncoast casino.

"I wrote to management about my bad experience there, and it's been 3 weeks without a response. Below I've pasted the email I sent, and I hope this inspires them to both do better with the issue AND responding to customer complaints. We will not be back.\n\n\""My husband and I chose your restaurant for our date night last night. It is not something we'd usually consider because of the price, but we wanted something special and we like your focus. I was led to believe that we would be well taken care of. It seemed like the whole staff knew of my gluten sensitivity. I felt confident that our server was checking with the chef despite not understanding what gluten was at all. I found out that instead, he submitted my order without checking at all. I had told him that I preferred the pheasant, and that the spaetzle could be replaced with anything gf and I would be happy. When the meal arrived as stated on the menu, I asked again and found out that he hadn't had a chance (in an hour!) to check if it was ok. It was whisked away, then he came back with a menu because the WHOLE MEAL was actually full of gluten. I quickly ordered the bass minus couscous since our 8pm show at the Bartell was quickly approaching. The salad provided so I didn't have to sit and watch my husband eat was a nice touch, but not enough to make up for the quickly cooked meal that arrived next. The fish seemed overdone, and the fava beans were hard. I ate it fast because I was hungry and in a hurry, not because it was so delicious I couldn't hold back. For over $100, I guess I expected better. I get that the fish was made under pressure, but the service that led to it was the real disappointment. I still tipped the server because I know that's his livelihood, but he didn't deserve it.\n\nA solution for the future is to have a separate gluten free menu with a few choices on it so the servers don't have to guess and check.\""",1
"Very disappointed with the claim jumper.  The food wasn't hot, the service was .. blech and it was just disappointing for the amount of money spent.  I would never go to this location again.",1
Service was pretty good but the price changes day by day for the same order,2
Probably one of the better indian restaurants  in the west island. Was here for the weekend lunch buffet. A fairly large selection of dishes  was on offer. My favourite was probably the lamb and the bhindi. The chicken pakoras were pretty disappointing as were the samosas. The was pretty hard and did not seem that fresh. Overall a pretty solid buffet for under 20$ with tax and tip. The service was great.,2
"The food, service, and price was great. As a newbie to Thai food, so far this is one of my favorites.",4
When I came to this location only one girl was working window and front. I literally waited 10min to even get an order and while I was ordering she was trying to make a milkshake and get drinks for the drive thru. I felt bad for her I could tell she was stressed so I bit my tongue. But sadly they messed up my order too. I wanted the new 6 burger with the homemade bun but instead I got the regular bun. Which is the whole reason I went there was to try it. I then had to wait another 10 min for them to get me a new burger. \n\nTip to management: you are running your floor thin and understaffed. You may not have a lot of hours to use cause of a slow location. But experience of customers is key. Plus over working your employees! Get someone else in there to help with the windows so the people who do choose to come in and enjoy your service can actually enjoy it!!!,1
are you f'ing kidding me?  20 bucks for a cup of ice-cream?????,0

"A few friends from out of town wanted to meet at Sushi Kim for dinner, so I agreed. The sushi selections seemed to satisfy their tastes, while their kids liked the miso soup, and edamame beans (which were replenished when asked). \n\nI'm not a fan of Japanese food, so I stuck with the Korean selections, after all I was in a Korean restaurant! I had Mandu Guk, which was a good size bowl of meat filled dumplings, and broth. My daughter had the pork bulgogi which she liked, but we've had better. The pork was really greasy, and not cooked on a fire grill, no char marks, equals less than tasty meat. \n\nSushi Kim alternates between a hit, or a miss. Sometimes you get a few different panchan, (side dishes of pickled or marinated vegetables), and sometimes you only get kimchi, wth? If you judge a place by it's patrons, I've seen few Koreans eat here, so that sums up the authenticity factor. Nice big restaurant, just lacking in overall experience.",1
"I finally got a chance to go for some sushi with friends after 7 months of being in Pittsburgh.  Nice atmosphere.  NOW THE DOWN SIDE!  Took 30 mins to be seated (not such big deal),  took forever getting drinks, then we noticed  people that came in after us were getting their orders and the place was starting to clear out.  Mind you, this is 35 minutes after being seated and placing our order.  So, I ask the waitress  \""um...so yeah is our order ready yet?\""  Her response \""they're making the sushi.\""  The manager comes and checks on our table.  Why?  He pretty much blew us off.  Another 25 minutes goes by.  Forget it!  Cancel my order!  The next thing ya know...here comes our food.  ARE YOU SERIOUS!   They still charged us for the appetizers/drinks.  Won't go back!  I'm mailing the owner a nice little letter about my experience...ugh!",0
"I never even heard of Ferraro's, but friends had a restaurant.com coupon, so we decided to try it out.  I'm glad that we did!  We first had a drink at the bar (25% off everything during happy hour from 4-7p), and then were seated in the beautiful, traditional dining room.  Our waiter was from Italy (I can't remember which part), and had a lovely accent and was attentive and charming the entire night.  We also found out that locals get 50% off the entire regular menu (specials not included), but we couldn't combine the coupon with the special.  Our waiter was gracious enough to calculate which would be the better value for us.\n\nThe food was delicious as well.  We started with the beef carpaccio and calamari. I LOVED the calamari- seasoned nicely, the breading wasn't too heavy, and I could have eaten it all night.  I ordered the lobster risotto for my entree and was very, very pleased. There was tons of lobster meat, and the risotto was creamy and well seasoned.\n\nThe creme brulee was a delicious ending to our meal, but the canolli was a bit disappointing. Nonetheless, it was a lovely dining experience and we will return.",3
"Beware your reservations here. Front of the house has some work to do. \n\nMy sister booked the private room 6 weeks ago for combined Father's Day/birthday brunch celebration. When she didn't get confirmation, she called yesterday and was told it wasn't on file. (Reservation was taken by phone, not online.)\n\nMy sis asked if restaurant could do anything to make up for the error. Hostess said no.",0
"I recommend YOU DO NOT STAY HERE! If you have ANY class or integrity about you. If you don't? Well this place is just right for you! \n\nI wish I could give this disgusting smoke smelling hell hole a negative review! \n\nFirst of all, I was trying to check in early. Check-in is at 3pm. I showed up at 11. If they said it was way too early to check-in, no big deal, I would have left and come back. HOWEVER they said they could allow me to check-in early for an extra fee of $28.00, which is a cleaning fee. A cleaning fee? They wanted me to pay extra for a job that the maid gets paid to do already?! I asked to speak with a manager and she said to just give them a room. So my question is, where, or rather who's pockets, was this extra $28 going? Really? When they already had a room ready to go!! \n\n\nSecondly, If you are a non smoker, like I am, you can smell the repulsive putrid smell that tobacco can leave lingering behind, anywhere, ESP in room 8115! Upon walking into the room the smell hits you like a ton of bricks. I have curly hair and any of my curly haired sisters would know, our hair likes to trap smells of ANY kind, good or bad. I was in the room for 20 mins as I changed clothes and then shortly after left to go about my day. I could smell smoke for hours, just as if I had spent time in one of the casinos for a while...\n\nI came back around 345pm and honestly was so upset the room still smelled the same as I left it, I asked if I could cancel. The thought of inhaling the terrible aroma of tobacco all night was unbearable. The lady at the front desk said since I used a third party to book, I would have to go thru the ties party to cancel. Okay ... So I called them, they put me on hold, called Siena Suites and was told by the lady at the front desk they will not refund the money. \n\nSo I asked the front lady, why not just tell me that in the first place? She had no response. I asked to speak with the manager. Over the phone, Bill Deyo- the Director of Operations, told the front desk lady that I could check-out but he will not refund the $140.00 I spent on the room, FOR ONE NIGHT. Unacceptable. So she offered me another room, room 13302. Told me to check it out and if it's okay, just transfer my belongings there. I was not pleased, but took the key and checked it out... Low and behold, that same sickening smell creeped up my nostrils. \n\nI went back to the front desk, told them it was the same, and asked to speak with the manager. They took me to Bill Deyo's office, and he said he went to my room, room 8115, and it smelled like perfume. CLEARLY THIS MAN IS A SMOKER, bc no perfume can cover the smell of tobacco no where, no how. He said that bc it is NYE and bc the room doesn't smell like smoke, he will not refund my money. \n\nI have never had such poor service in my life!! I will never stay here again in my life! If your customer is telling you OVeR and OVER again that it smells like smoke, why not accommodate them?? Rather than have an angry, disgruntled customer that will tell everyone and anyone NOT to ever stay here.  This place is a joke! Has sheets from the 80's, old carpet, OLD furniture... The list goes on. I could look past it if the smell wasn't so bad... But clearly Siena Suites Hotel and Bill Deyo could care less how their customers feel. \n\nMy honest opinion, even if you see a cheap price when you see this place online.. Keep scrolling. Don't be trapped or stuck or out money, bc you don't want to stay here. As if I have $140 to just throw away ... Just disgusted with this place-- DO NOT STAY HERE! Trust me, you will thank me later! Or if you do stay here, you'll here me saying I told you so, in the back of your mind within minutes of checking-in and opening the room to your door ...",0
Old fashioned cafe. Simple meat and three menu plus a bunch of sandwiches. \nMassive amount of food. \nMost of patrons work nearby.,2
"My parents insist on eating here every time they come to town. Not that I mind of course. The bugsy omelet has suckered me into trying to gorge myself on several occasions. It has Italian roast beef in it...and is scrumptious! My Mom loves the Popeye omelet, which has a lot of spinach in it. The home fries are really good too! I sometimes visit the other location on west Buffalo because it's closer. I heard they opened one in the new Alliante casino, I'll have to try that as well.",3
"Great quality and vast selection of Bio/local foods and goods. Service is very courtois and knowledgeable. The biggest downside to this establishement is the price tag. Every time i make a purchase there, i'm always surprised at the high price. I've concluded that most goods there are between 2 and 4$ more expensive than another groceries store, not counting March\u00e9 Jean-Talon.",2
"A friend and I go to McCarran Airport. He gets dropped off at Southwest; I'm going to Virgin. \n\nMe: I'll just get off here too.\n\nDriver: Naw, it's in the next terminal.\n\nMe: I don't mind. I've got plenty of time.\n\nDriver: Naw, I'll just take you right up there.\n\nMe: Well ... OK.\n\nDriver: (drives around the whole airport, racks up $7 extra fare)\n\nMe: What the hell?! I would have gotten out if you told me you were going to do THAT. Now I'm pissed. By the way, what's this $3 'voucher charge'?\n\nDriver: uh, that's from the company.\n\nMe: It's not anything to do with the credit card machine?\n\nDriver: No, the only way is to accept it.\n\nMe: I don't accept it.\n\nDriver: ...\n\nMe (calls cab company and complains)\n\nCab company: Sorry, we didn't do anything wrong, and by the way, that voucher fee actually was a credit card fee.\n\nMe: (files chargeback with credit card company for the entire cab fare)\n\nGood job!

"Kahunaville is mine and my sister's guilty pleasure bar. We really love it here. The vibe is so fun and the drinks are plentiful and so amazingly weird. \n\nWe came here one evening and had a really nice time. The bartender was charming and very friendly. We each had a couple of really nice cocktails and left with many large cups as souvenirs. \n\nFun place.\n\nPerhaps the only downer was the creepy older gentleman who thought it was ok to lift me over his head and plop me down on the dance floor. No, it is not ok. Not at all.",3
"I thought this was a good show for the price.  It can get very expensive in Vegas and it was nice to find a reasonable show that provided entertainment and booze.  We had VIP seats that got us front row.  The venue is small, cozy and has a great view of the strip through the \""Windows\"" theater.\nOpening act appeared to be young and new to the stage.  Some of the content was good, some was ok and some was offensive.  Pretty standard for a comedy show.\nSecond and headliner were more relaxed and had routines.  Again, not all the content was my cup of tea, but I found myself laughing more than not.\nNice to have a close, personal show in such a big overwhelming city.\n\nGet groupon or discounted tickets and keep an open mind.",2
"***The lunch at RM Seafood's downstairs dining area is pleasant enough, but it does not make me eager to return anytime soon***\n\nRM Seafood is from Top Chef Masters contestant Rick Moonen.  The restaurant is located in Mandalay Place (right next to Mandalay Bay) and features two dining areas--an upstairs dining room for more ambitious fine dining and a downstairs area for more rustic fare.  The downstairs area has a gastropub-like feel.  The look is simple and contemporary with a big focus on lacquered medium-colored woods (the decor is reminiscent of a less dark Houston's or Westside Tavern).\n\nRM Seafood's downstairs lunch menu is casual, but there is a wide range of dishes so there is a wide range of prices.  Some of the options include a raw bar, starters, sandwiches, salads, entrees, and soups.\n\nI started with the crab cake, which was a blue crab cake that was pan seared.  It was served with a carrot, jicama and cucumber salad as well as a light aioli.  The crab cake was good.  There was a generous portion of crab and it was moist and fresh.  The sear provided some crispiness (no burnt flavor).  A lot of the flavor accents were citrus-like and bright (not too overpowering).  The little salad of carrot, jicama and cucumber was fresh and refreshing.\n\nI had the catfish sloppy joe, which was featured (I believe) on The Best Thing I Ever Ate as well as Top Chef Masters (though that sloppy joe was a shrimp version).  The sloppy joe had a standard sloppy joe bun.  I was hoping for a better bun.\n\nThe mixture definitely had a sloppy joe taste.  In addition to the sweet sauce, the mixture included catfish, peppers and onions.  There were also sliced pickles in the sandwich.  The sandwich tasted fine, but there was not enough catfish.  The mixture was almost entirely made up of peppers and onions.  In the end, the sloppy joe did not feel any more special than any other sloppy joe.\n\nThe housemade potato chips were good.  They were light and crispy and not too greasy.  They were also nicely seasoned and not salty.\n\nFor dessert, I went with their peanut butter s'mores.  The dessert was fairly elaborate and consisted of a flourless chocolate cake base topped with a peanut butter caramel-like bar and toasted marshmallow.  The candy bar-esque dessert was garnished with a hot chocolate sauce and a graham cracker ice cream.\n\nThe dessert was okay and satisfying, but it was nothing memorable.  I did like the many elements (the stretchy peanut butter filling as well as the toasted marshmallow); I also felt the graham cracker ice cream had both a good flavor as well as a creamy and smooth consistency.\n\nService was very good.  My waitress was friendly, polite and attentive.  The food came out at a good pace and the whole staff seemed cheery and personable.\n\nMost of the plates were in the $18-$25 price range (the prices would probably be high for most cities, but for The Strip, I guess the prices were not too bad).  The food was filling.\n\nI did like the crab cake at RM Seafood, but I felt my entree and dessert were both pleasant but not good enough to make me want to come back.  Rick Moonen served some very elaborate and ambitious food on Top Chef Masters so maybe trying his upstairs dining area will provide a much more rewarding experience.\n\nMandalay Bay and Mandalay Place share a parking structure, which is free (pretty easy to find a space).",2
This is by far the best greek restaurant in town. I'm a vegetarian so I always get the spanakopita and greek salad.,4
Drive through was quick. Food is the same as any other King.,2
Costa vida can be good the problem is that it's not constantly good. Also the pricing is confusing and if you ask the employes (ex. Does a side of sour cream cost anything?) all of them will give you a different answer. I like the pork but a lot of the time it is hardly shredded at all.,1

Or no openings for my Aussiedoodle? Interesting.",0
"I used to frequent this place 7 years ago, moved away, and went back again last night. The service is still efficient and good, however the noise level in the dining area is very high. If you are looking for a quiet and relaxing meal, this is not the place. \n\nLet's start with the good stuff. The complimentary bread comes out crusty and hot and the flavored spreads were delicious!  The burrata with heirloom tomatoes and arugula with a balsamic dressing was slightly overdressed, but amazing! The little hint of fresh mint in the dressing takes it over the top! The clam chowder was very good. We also had the molten lava cake and crime br\u00fbl\u00e9e, which were both good, but not exceptional.\n\nNow to the big disappointment. We both had the rib eye steak, medium rare. The seasoning was good, but the outside wasn't crusted or charred enough. The cut of meat was hard to eat with bite after bite of gristle and too much fat. Overall, just a bad cut of meat!  We used to have a manager's special, a double bone-in rib eye for two (that they no longer have available...not to be confused with the one on the menu) that came out sizzling hot and crusty, and was to die for! They need to bring it back!  Their signature potatoes were good, but came out with the cheese already hardened and cold at the top. Tasted like it was made far in advance and dried out. When I cut into the cheese, the top separated like you'd expect with leftovers. The asparagus was very skinny and so tough I couldn't even cut through them with my steak knife. To their credit, our server was happy to replace it with green beans (which were very good).\n\nOverall, we had a pleasant experience, but the main attraction fell short. Where's the beef?!!",1
"Went last night for a semi private event.In my opinion,that's the only time to go.I was happy to see it seems they made some improvements since the last time I went,however the floor is crappy with a few rough patches that need to be worked out.\nMaybe it's just that I've been spoiled by high end rinks like Roxy,Metropolis,Lloyd's and the Paradise that are all sadly no more (except Lloyd's,but I don't get to Canada as often as I used to).I liked Surfside for their staff and great floor,but they are gone as well.\nSo all I have now is this place that when it's public skate,is overcrowded and full of constantly falling and crawling kids...I have also run into the surly manager someone mentioned in a filtered review which,in combination with everything else,keeps me away until such time as anyone rents the rink privately for an event I can wangle my way in to...",2
"We have eaten breakfast here awhile back and it was pretty good. Reason for the 2 stars. \nI happened to get a craving for apple pie. I stopped off, around midnight, and the place was busy enough to slow my order down. I ordered coffee and apple pie ala mode. MISTAKE!! The apple pie was really doughy and the coffee tasted like they created a new pot with OLD grounds. EGADS!!\nThe best part was eating the ice cream.  I probably should have stopped off at Mickey Dees across the street, from what I hear their coffee has a lot more flavor than here.",1
"We completely enjoyed the Le Reve show!!  I would totally recommend it as it is a nice blend of athletics, synchronized swimming, diving, dancing, effects with water and lights and visuals - it had it all!  We were mesmerized in a dream-like state - we all enjoyed it so much!!  They serve drinks, soft drinks and popcorn too that you can eat inside the theater.",4
"Worst place I have ever lived at.. The office said is very unprofessional, shady, and do not care about their residents. I WOULD NOT recommend living here.. Justine doesn't even know anything about the industry and is dumb founded about everything. When she first gave us our apartment, she gave us a handicapped one.... We were not going to live in a handicap apartment. Then she told me that an actual unit would not be available for another month so she made a stay in another apartment until our apartment was ready.. Tony the maintenance Guy is constantly buying drugs off other residents which one instance I witnessed it. The buildings are very pretty and has a lot to offer, The landscaping is phenomenal and the pools are wonderful. But in order to make more money for the company and to have the business grow I believe that you need to weed out some of your staff members because they are the reason why people are submitting their 60 day notice. I signed a year contract and I am being kicked out of the apartment by management because of my dog that I have which don't forget he does have a paper from my doctor stating the fact that he's my service dog.",0
"I wish I could own a franchise of Portillos! Seriously. My Dad went to the original location growing up, and it's my boyfriend's favorite restaurant (he is also from Chicago).

"Terrible service at the caffe. We ate dinner there and the wait was long even though the restaurant was only half full. The food wasn't that great either. We tried it for breakfast thinking maybe it would be ok. Wow we're we wrong. We ended up waiting again for a table and I could see at least five available. The waitress never came to great us, she was bussing the table next to us.  When she came to take our drink order instead of going to get it she went back to the table to set the silverware. I asked her if she could just bring the coffee. She said ok and still went back to the other table. Worst service I've ever experienced.",0
"What is so hard about making a sandwich? It seems so easy, yet both Quiznos and Subway can't seem to master it. I have made two recent trips to Quiznos and have been totally disappointed both times. I mean, can I have some food on my sandwich? Just a thought. The servings are miniscule. All I could taste was soft bread, lettuce and some sort of paste (was it tuna?). Awful. And the price? Holy cow! The first time was $5 for a couple of mouthfuls. The second time was almost $9 for slightly more. Next time, I'll just go to the store and do it myself.",0
"So many desperate women, so little time.",4
"I have heard people say this place is food coma central. Came here after a night of fun and decided to get some food. \n\nFood: \nSage fried chicken and waffle. This was a huge plate and what felt like a mountain of food, but that did not intimate me. I was ready to dig in and was definitely impressed. The flavor was good and everything worked well together.  roscoe chickens and waffle is definitely better in my book. This dish was around $15- 16 and i think it is worth your money to try this place once. \n\nService\nWe were seated pretty quickly, but then again it was 4 am. The staff here was attentive and ensure we were comfortable and got what we needed. \n\nThere is no phone service here so you would have to take pictures and upload later.",2
Late night AYCE sushi and drinking place. Average sushi at a great price if you get the AYCE which ends before 1am so arrive well before that to take advantage of it. The yuzu yellowtail was the best nigiri option when we went. I liked the crispy rice and spicy tuna from the rolls. Lots of rolls to choose from and you can also get brown rice sushi for $1 extra charge. Staff is quite friendly at this Korean owned place.,2
"Service was very slow. 20 minutes to brew a pot of coffee. Waitress took our order 5 minutes after delivering the coffee. 10 more minutes to deliver our meal. We both ordered fish and chips. Lots of large fries, lots of green peas, small single piece of fish. The fish was mediocre at best. Crispy breading but virtually  tasteless. In fact quite ordinary. We will not return.",0
"I used to come here often when they were \""the place to be\""... well on this day (yesterday, 06/06) if I would have seen a Tumble Weed roll by i would have know it was from this place and NOT the sidebar \""The Saloon\"" (get it??) \n\nAnyway, we walked in around 7:30ish (just killin time before The Comedy Zone show) much to the surprise of (i counted) 7 employees, sitting down by the bar, some over by the tv. the bartender was some kid that looked as shocked as we did that we were there. \n\nShe'll have a Call-a-Cab, \nI'll have a Call-a-cab mixed w/ Apple please.\n16.00\nI finished mine, but my company cldn't... \""eewww its too strong.. blah blah blah\""\n\nIf you been to one, you've been to em all..

"I really wanted to love Luci's. Sadly, I did not. \n\nMy parents are old, really old. Due to their chronic old-ness, they tend to have inflexible habits. Since I am not old, I don't share many of these routines. \n\nThey like coffee, I drink tea. They need dessert whereas I don't eat sweets. On a recent weekend visit I decided to side step some of these issues by taking them to Luci's for dessert and coffee. \n\nBetween the three of us we ordered three 12 ounce coffees, one cinnamon roll and two pieces of an apple tart. Total bill? $23 bucks... Ah well, I thought, you pay for quality. \n\nright? \n\nNo. The cinnamon roll looked and tasted exactly like the deadly square things you can get at any convenience store. Even heated the frosting didn't loosen up, rather it kept its glue like consistency. \n\nThe apple tart looked magnificent, however the flavor was severely lacking. The taste was like a fleeting thought of apple, as if I was remembering a good slice of pie. \n\nThe coffee was simply OK, nothing great. \n\nI love the open feel to Luci's, and the patio area is great. The lunch menu has some very interesting options that I will come back to try. \n\nAs I gazed longingly at the Starbucks across the street I realized that maybe, just maybe, my parents were on to something. If you don't try new things you probably won't be disappointed.",1
"Not very good at all. Went there with a friend, waited about 15 minutes for our food. It was cooked in front of us, but when we picked it up it was cold! Not to mention some tables are directly across from the rest room. A little off putting. My friend got a chicken egg roll that had a weird smell to it. She didn't risk it and threw it away. It was soggy too.\n\nI would rather go to teriyaki madness.",0
"This place is awesome!!! A little expensive but it's once a year so it's worth it. The line was long but it moved quickly so I don't know what everyone is complaining about. We went on Halloween so you could imagine his busy it was. Plus the line was actually fun because they have a few monsters and clowns walking around  for entertainment. The haunted house itself was perfectly scary. The set up was great, it actually felt like we were going the 13th floor. We loved it! Zombie land is the second attraction which is just eh. I'm not into this whole zombie craze everyone's into so I didn't care much for it. \n\nThis place is definitely better than fear farm.  \nI'd definitely go back!",4
"Not bad, but will not be returning.\n\nThe food wasn't particularly bad, but it wasn't particularly good either.  We ordered the platter.  The pulled pork had an off taste, the ribs were good, brisket slightly dry.  Sauce served on the side tasted like any bottled barbecue sauce.\n\nFlies were annoying.\n\nWaitress was nice.  Took a while for food to be served though...",1
"Fun!  Purchased a groupon with friends and we all loved it.  I like how painting is paired with wine here.  Gia's steps are easy to follow and I'm pretty happy with my paintings.  The only thing is, it's so expensive.  I would only do it again as a date, for a fundraising event, or with a group of girlfriends.\n\nI've gone twice already.  Once with a groupon and once for an Alzheimer's fundraising event.  I really enjoyed the fundraising event because I like to spend money that I know will be donated to a good cause.

"This is a sad review for me to write because when asked about my favorite restaurant in pgh, I would always say toast. I hadn't been in about two years but suggested it for a friend's bday. Like reviewer Alexis K, I feel embarrassed for saying how much i love Toast because the food was awful. The sweet and sour tofu was a disgusting block of tofu that was un-seasoned and unseared. literally a block of tofu cut in half. The monkfish was salty as were the lentils that went along with it. my risotto was not even made with risotto rice and it was crunchy. i'm so super bummed. luckily the wine selection is still ok and the place is really cute. but what happened to the food? ugh. super bummer for pittsburgh.",1
"Wonderful!!\nThe new look is wonderful.\nThe food was amazing!  The usual Greek fare with a few twists.  Fried zucchini with skordalia, oh my gosh what a wonderful treat. The avgolemono was delish, maybe a little more lemon juice could've been added.  The entrees were scrumptious, hubby had the combination platter, all his faves.  I opted for the Greek chicken and wasn't disappointed.\nI hope Plaka is around for a long time as I intend to be a regular customer!\nThe waiter we had also worked for the family that owned OPA, he has some amazing serving skills that are worth noting!\nG",3

"This is a little cute place in middle of Tempe Marketplace.  It is situated pretty well and it is very lively.  They do self-serve for $0.39/ounce with so many kinds of toppings.  My problem was that there weren't many flavors to choose from and they were out of mochi.  We tried the original, cookies & cream, chocolate, and vanilla.  My fav was chocolate.  It was rich but not too sweet.  The other flavors were just ok.\n\n*Location = good\n*Price = ok I guess\n*Yogurt = I still like Yogurberry best in Arizona",2
"This company has the worst business model I have ever seen. I've lived in 8 states, and different parts of a couple of them. I have not seen this added charges for connections, having no choice but to sign a contract and not being able to change your service (NOT CANCEL) without being charged early termination since the 80's when cable was new. this should be illegal, I think it is in some states. The best service I have ever received was from Time Warner Cable in Austin, Texas. \n\nI am going with satellite and another ISP service. and whats with the phone service in the city? Everyone wants you to get phone service or pay more. with cell phones, who needs a land line? there must be huge margins there....",0
"Had the nopal burrito, not a fan of the rice but liked the tortilla and carne.  The btead they use for the burgers and dogs is unique an dc tasty..almost sweet, very good.

"Great customer service, very good deals to be had, and a constantly revolving inventory make this one of the best stops to make in Phoenix.\n\nI try to make it here a few times a month to catch some of the deals they consistently have.\n\nCheck out their crossroads of the west booth if you can; it is when they bring out the best inventory and often the best prices.",4
"I shopped here during the holiday season, but avoided it like the plague during my last LV trip in March/April.  Just like M&M's World, this place is definitely a tourist trap.  That of course equates to a lot of noise, crowds and young families, which in turn causes one big headache.  Not my favorite kind of atmosphere, yet I did get a kick out of taking pictures with the costumed Coca-Cola Polar Bear, and I definitely couldn't resist buying a bunch of discounted souvenirs for people back home and myself.  Despite all the cute-sy / bright / retro merchandise though, this is definitely not somewhere I'd go out of my way to check out again (but every Vegas tourist should experience it at least once, IMO).",2
"I have to agree with the people who gave this shop POOR reviews.  I too have lived in Ahwatukee for 15+ years and have gone to this shop many times in the past.  It seems they are getting worse and worse.  I will never go back and I would encourage you to do the same.  Although I have spent thousands of dollars at this shop on bikes and service, my recent experiences were TERRIBLE; both with the hip-hop, gangster looking \""kid\"" up front \""Dennis\"" and the owner who didn't want to \""undermine\"" the incorrect information, bad attitude and poor customer service his novice front-man had been providing.  I purchased a Specialized FSR from this shop over the years along with many other parts, accessories and services for all of my family's bikes (all Specialized). I had not gone back in a while because the service had been getting worse.  But I figured it's 2013 and I'd give them another shot and try to support them.\n\nYesterday I called to get prices on some basic work - replace a wheel, replace a couple tubes, etc.  Dennis asked me some questions and quoted me prices - very straight forward.  I loaded up my gear, my kids and headed to the shop.  Dennis (wearing his gangster hat, earrings and a bad attitude) looked and said \""I quoted you the wrong parts\"",....he said it's going to be about $70 additional on top of what was only going to be about $70 anyway.  I proposed that since they quoted me the wrong prices over the phone and I just hauled all my gear and my kids over there, that we split the difference or make some kind of proposal to make it right.  I said I understand sometimes things get quoted wrong, but let's do the right thing, come to an arrangement we are both happy with and everything will be good.  I made a couple proposals and to each he said no, he will only charge me full price of all the misquoted items.  Some guy, apparently the owner, who never introduced himself to me or said he'd like to help, rather, he said he didn't want to undermine Dennis, started barking at me, saying \""what, you never make a mistake? - you want me to do the work for free? - are we not allowed to make a mistake?  you can take your business elsewhere\"".  I said, really, you want to lose a long-term, loyal customer who has spent thousands of dollars in your shop because you quoted the wrong price and now you don't even want to try to come to an arrangement that will work for both of us?  I realize you don't want to lose money, who would,...but I'm sure we can come to some arrangement since you quoted me the wrong prices after I gave you all the information you asked for. He was not interested, kept his negative, poor service attitude and went back into the shop to work on a bike part.  I was shocked.  My little boys were shocked!  As we drove toward Curbside Cyclery and Javelina Cycles (trustworthy shops) to get the work done, my boys both said they could not believe how unreasonable they were at South Mountain Cycles and how impressed they were with me for talking nicely and trying to get it worked out into a win/win solution when the guys at SMC were such \""jerks\"".  Pretty insightful for 13 and 11 year old boys (who also will never take their business to SMC as they grow up).\n\n***** I would recommend you AVOID SMC BIKE SHOP *****  The owner and his staff CLEARLY don't care about customer service, quality workmanship or doing the right thing (and reading the other reviews, I'm not the only one who has had the same experience - sure, you can buy a bike from them, they'll be happy to take your money for a sale,....but don't expect to be treated well regarding service or parts from there after).  I'd guess the positive reviews are written by their friends or employees.  There are several other shops here in Ahwatukee that are honest and quality.  Let's show SMC that we won't accept being treated poorly.  Let's take our business elsewhere and support shops that support our community and treat us with the respect we have shown them all these years that is obviously not reciprocated.  Check out all the negative Google reviews on this place.",0
"I met my husband here for lunch the other day. I have been to this Chili's before and never had any issues with food or service. My last visit left a lot to be desired though.\n\nFirst thing I noticed when I walked in was that there was no one at the hostess stand. I had arrived first and wanted to freshen up in the little girls room but there was no hostess to direct me, or seat me for that matter. Thankfully I was able to find the restroom on my own. \n\nAfter freshening up, the hostess was up front and my husband had arrived. We were seated and our server took our drink order pretty quickly which was appreciated. I decided to order the bbq chicken salad and my man went with the grilled chicken sandwich, guiltless style (which means no cheese, no mayo, just meat and veggies on a bun). My husband was very specific when ordering, making it clear he wanted nothing on the bun of his sandwich. He also asked for steamed veggies on the side instead of the fries it came with. \n\nMy salad came out fine. A little heavy on the dressing but it was a really tasty ranch so I did not mind too much. My husband's sandwich on the other hand... He had to take it apart and eat it with a knife and fork because the bun was so greasy. The steamed veggies were well cooked but covered in cheese.. Which was not indicated on the menu. \n\nUsually in a situation like this if the server inquired how the food was, my husband or I would speak up. Unfortunately we were not checked on until after both of us had wrapped up eating and put our napkins on our plates... Despite the fact that my glass of water had been close to empty for a good 10 minutes. Once we were checked on, my lunch hour was almost over so there was nothing that could be done anyways. The server never bothered to ask how the meal was which was disappointing. You would think that he would have thought something was up when he saw how much food was being left on the plate.\n\nI will probably eat at Chili's again in the future but I am going to try to avoid frequenting this particular location.",1
"If you want a professional looking document printed, DONT GO HERE. Quality service is terrible. Screw up an order once, shame on you, screw it up twice, shame on me...I don't know what you say after a third time. I will never come back here again. \n\nThis last time I was very specific with what I wanted. I asked for a full bleed. I set to normal parameters then made sure Rey understood and left. Four hours late when I came back my project looked terrible. When I said it wasn't acceptable, they said it was my fault. They knew what I wanted and when they saw a problem, instead of calling, they just ran it anyway. Then the girl helping me walked around continuing to mutter under her breath. \n\nGreat people you've got working for you OfficeMax!",0
"We love eating breakfast out with our group of friends, so we chose this place becuase of its' wonderful review in the Arizona Republic.  \n\nIt may be wonderful for lunch or dinner, but we had by far the worst breakfast and the worst service ever experienced in the Valley.  I might note that we arrived at 7:30AM and were by ourselves in the dining room.  You would think that because we were early the service would be wonderful.  Not so!!  We had to go and find out waitress to refill our coffee.   She served toast but forgot to bring jelly to the table.  Everything we ordered was either wrong or undercooked.  One person in our party sent her food back to be cooked; the other was so disgusted with the appearance of the raw eggs (in her omelet) that she chose just to eat the toast and forget the eggs.  \n\nThe \""special\"" that day was a crab omelet.  Unfortunately the omelets that we ordered tasted like fish, whether we wanted it or not.  (We didn't)  \n\nWe had a very hard time locating the restaurant, and would have been much better off  if we had never found it and went somewhere else.\n\nTerrible experience!!",0
"Our cat recently came down with some health issues that we could not afford to address. He was in pain and we decided the humane thing was to put him to sleep. We went to the ARL and asked the receptionist there if we had any other options available to us. \""Well basically the only thing you can do is sign him over for euthanasia\"" she said in the most uncaring, apathetic voice possible. We were heartbroken of course. \""Go wait by that door and someone will meet you.\"" After a few minutes another woman came out and took the carrier. \""I'll bring your carrier back out in a minute.\"" We said no, that's okay, keep the carrier. She said okay and took our cat to the back. And that was it. No kind words, no sympathetic gestures, no \""Would you like a moment before I take him?\"" No \""I'm sorry.\"" Nothing. For us this was one of the worst days of our lives but nobody at the ARL seemed to care, or at least have been trained to pretend to care, one bit. \n\nThey get a couple stars for offering a necessary service. But other than that, this place will only be associated with making a terrible day that much worse with their lack of caring or empathy.",1
"First Filipino food truck, is surely, one of a kind. I was really impress, that some one had an idea to take the food truck business and go all Filipino on it. Even though there are some restaurants out there that does sell Filipino food. But not that many people know about these restaurants. Making Filipino food mobile, and taking it around Vegas, is one hell of idea to get Filipino style food out in the open. \n\nI was attending the Food Truck Feast that was off MLK and in front of Costco. Never really seen so many food truck in one place. On the other hand, I never really went to a food truck event, cause I thought it was just horrible food. But I was really impress with the quality of these food trucks. \n\nBBQ Boy really stuck out, cause it does remind me of home and how mother use to cook. Even though we only had the meat sticks, it just brings me back home. I would of ordered more, but it seem like a popular truck that we didn't want to hold up the line. But the quality of the meat stick was awesome. \n\nIf you ever get the chance to encounter BBQ Boy food truck, take advantage of it, cause its really worth it. At least try the meat sticks and taste it for yourself.",3
I've been coming here since 2006 to get my nails done.\n\nI love that the prices are very reasonable and the nails and pedicures come out fantastic! I love that they don't look cheap like most places... The pedicures are at least 30 minutes and give you a little foot massage as well...\n\nI also come here to get my eyebrows waxed and they do an amazing job!! Won't go anywhere else...,3
"I am a huge fan of Gardunos in ALBUQUERQUE but not Scottsdale.  It seems like when they opened here in Scottsdale, they forgot to make sure the food tastes good.  I have been here many times and it seems like the food was frozen prior to it being served.  Also, the service is not too good.  If you sit at the bar, be prepared for an over eager, spikey haired bartender to offer you a drink.  Also be prepared for him to forget that he took your order.  Yes, this HAS happened to me.  The margaritas are WATERED DOWN and the BEERS ARE FLAT!  The best thing about this is their happy hour.  They have a lot of free food.  Of course, be prepared to get SCOWLED AT if you pig out on the food and don't have more than one beer. Haha.",1
"ASC Is Okay,....\n\nI've had better food. The Sandwich I had was the meatball. It was okay, the meatballs tasted like they were pre made, and had a little sour hint to them, as if it were a lemon type of seasoning or something. However the bread was very good. \nThe staff was very nice, and very welcoming to me as a first time customer. \nI need to go back and try other menu items...",2
Sniff!  Cigarette smoke!\nThrill!  Gasp!  Electric fire!\nNouvel?  No!  Old-vel!,1
Great wine.  Great ambiance.   Nice servers.  Bruschetta awesome.  So was the artichoke and hummus dip.,4
"What's with all these businesses proclaiming \""Best\"" in their titles, you're just setting yourself up to be Yelped.\n\nMy experience with Best Kebab couldn't have been more routine, except when I placed my order. The guy at the counter rung up the order and...pulled my chips from under the counter...all ready...like he made it 5 minutes before I even arrived.\n\nNow, if they can time travel and freshly cook my order before i've even entered the shop, then they can have the title Best Kebab.\n\nBut in reality, I can only imagine how long it had been sitting there and walked out the shop as fast as I could.",0
Went here yesterday because of the good reviews and I must admit I am very disappointed. I don't know if it was a miscommunication or what but I wanted the gel nails and I did get acrylic but whatever I let that go. Then she then the gel topcoat I asked her to put on my nails are all bumpy. I pointed it out before I left and she had me put my hands in the uv light thing again and they are even worse. I think only one nail is smooth like it is supposed to be. And also i am pretty sure my thump nail is a little crooked but I am done complaining.\nI won't ever be back here again.,1
"After seeing all the other poor reviews this place has, I stand somewhat flabbergasted about how people see this place that way.  Honestly, I go here once a month at minimum with a group of people, at least 6-12 at a time.  The service is top-notch, we are always greeted with a smile, the managers know us by name as well as group, and the food is always on par with the iHop restaurants in upstate NY.  I have rarely ever had a complaint, and if I did, the staff did their best to make sure it was corrected as quickly as possible.  For a national brand that iHop is, I am not expecting 5-star meals every time, but they do fairly well with what they have.",3
"Ordered take out for breakfast. I got everything I asked for (extra blueberries in my pancakes, sub Swiss and egg whites in my omelette). When I got home, I really, really enjoyed my meal. It was less expensive and not obnoxiously huge like Egg Works. Great job!",4
"Overrated!!  I'm not going to give this place lower than a 3 because it didn't totally disappoint, but there are definitely better wine bar/restaurant/lounges. \n\nI can't comment on the service with the exception that my date had the wrong salad brought to her. They corrected the situation, but not until we said something. The waiter made a comment that he knew that wasn't what she ordered, but still didn't correct the situation before giving her the wrong dish. Other than that, it was busy, so I didn't expect exceptional service, but it was good.\n\nThe wine list was great, not a great deal after their 5pm happy hour, but a good selection. \n\nMy issue was the food. We both got salads, as mentioned before. The salads are small, and around $11. I added $3 chicken to mine for protein, and it was deli meat, and very little of it. I have no issues with prices, as nobody should when going to a wine bar, but expect to receive something comparable in value; this was not worth the $14-15 salad, nor was the complete dinner worth $60 after tip. I may go back for the happy hour, but not the food.",2
"Stay home and eat a frozen Swanson meal, it will be much better than any of the slop this joint serves.",0
"Does not even compare to our hometown Ruth's Chris in Fairfax, Va. Normally this is where we'd get the best steak we ever tasted. My husband's filet was just ok and almost over cooked. My scallops were boarder line undercooked and were just ok. Probably one of the worst meals we've had at a Ruth's Chris. However hats off to our server, Kathy who was excellent and very on top of things. As well as the hostess and other support staff, bussers, etc.",2
"I lived in Peru for 7 years, and I was really excited to try this restaurant.  A friend and I dined there this evening and I can honestly say, this is authentic Peruvian fare!  We shared the sampler platter of seafood which was recommended by the owner, who is Peruvian, and it was delicious.  Then we shared a dessert, I can't remember the name, but basically it was \""flan\"".  Great experience!  The service was excellent and the food was exceptional.  I highly recommend it....",4
"3.5 stars, but I don't think Woo Che is worthy of getting 4 stars from me. Came here for the second time after the stoke of midnight on New Year's Eve. We were originally at Tofu Hut, but they were full so decided to come here instead. It had been years since my last visit just because this is not my favorite spot for AYCE Korean BBQ, but the interior has definitely been improved. If they put a sign outside saying something like \""new and improved dinning area\"" would attack more patrons. You certainly can't beat the price of 11.99, but of course it certainly comes with its share of cutting corners. The selection seemed sort of limited and my favorite kalbi was missing. I opted trying a variety of meats, the marinated meats being my favorite. The marinated beef was my number 1 pick and kept going back to that. They were also missing the oil and spices that is normally served with KBBQ, it possibly could have been at the buffet line and just didn't see it? Overall who knows when I'll be back here because I'm willing to pay the extra few dollars for a better KBBQ on Spring Mtn.",2
"Food is adequate, but overpriced, servings are measley, and service is on the slow side. \n\nI had the Grilled Steak Salad ($12), which was good, and a decent amount of steak cooked properly, but not enough greens. It looked a little puny and sad when it arrived.  My friend ordered the Chicken Fried Steak breakfast ($13), and she did not care for the gravy, which was too pastey (i.e., old).  Her serving was also small ... The eggs, hashbrowns, and chicken fried steak didn't even fill the plate.  For the prices charged, the value is just not there.\n\nI worked at the Monte Carlo 5 years ago and the food in The Cafe was better in those days. The MC is a beautiful property, but I will stick to the Brew Pub on future visits.",1
"I bought my lunch here about a week ago and I thought it was decent, value for money food with quality service.  Admittedly, I should have had one of their trademark lattes, but I just wasn't in the mood for coffee.  The decor inside feels relaxed and stylish and the staff are friendly.  The 'layzee' part of the name refers to the chilled out atmosphere, rather than a poor standard of service.  \nI went for a cheese, ahm and tomato sandwich (wasn't on the menu, but made it up for me anyway) and a can of coke, which came to only \u00a33 altogether.  I thought this was a great deal and the bread was tasty along with decent quality ham, cheese and fresh tomato. \nI'd certainly come here again as it's a great coffee shop which offers nice, quicm service and brilliant food.",3
The inventory that the Exchange is limited compared to off base retail stores. They are also notorious for having two similar products located in different portions of the store. The moral of the associates is deplorable due to limited hours and managements poor treatment. The only reason some of the non-management and non-supervise associates have been there so long is that their spouse is in the military which is bringing in most of the house hold income. I use to work at this Exchange several years ago and the problems that existed back then still exists today. You would not believe the issues that management tries to hide from the military community.,1
"BEWARE!! This car wash damaged my 2008 Yukon Denali . Spoke with one of the owners, Justin, and he refused to work with me to get the damaged piece repainted.

Amazing.   Truly the best thing i've eaten in las vegas.   I came home from the bowling tournament at 1230am and was looking around and saw this wonderful place and ordered a double double and fries....quite possible the most amzing thing i've eaten in vegas....perfect.,4
"Finally made it to Bouchon on Sunday with my girlfriends. The Steak Frites was fabulous -- so tender and flavorful, thicker than I expected, and perfectly cooked. Two of us got steak so our helpful waitress suggested we switch one of the sides of fries for something else so I got the haricot vert which were slightly over cooked.  :-(  On the other hand, the fries were fabulous and one serving was definitely enough for all 4 of us to share!  LOL!  For dessert, we had the \""doughnuts\"" but they were nothing like any other donut I've ever had.  So good, it just melted in your mouth!  The cream filing was to die for!!  I would have given them 5 stars except that my friend's Croque Madame was way too salty.  Would definitely come back and looking forward to trying the Bouchon in LA.",3
"Although I feel like the flavors of Boiling Crab (in Alhambra) are better, I like it.  We ordered 1 lb shrimp of all the the flavors and it was perfect for a Friday night pig out.  My favorite was the garlic - all the bits of the garlic and the all the juices dripping of the shrimp.  Tasty!  Also, the deep fried catfish with tartar sauce was yummy and the cajun fries that come with the catfish were perfect -Nice and crispy and seasoned with the cajun seasoning!  yum yum",3
Wow this place was ok before but now it's heading downhill...fast! \n\nI ordered the hamburger steak & they now use frozen patties and douse it with salty brown gravy. (maybe Chinese cooks need to stop smoking so try can actually taste their own food) My son ordered the chicken katsu & I figured they couldn't mess that up but they managed to burn some of the katsu. \n\nTo top it off it wasn't even crowded & they still botched up the katsu.\n\nI understand that quality control may be a problem with a franchise but this is borderline insulting to all the other L & L's. Just a little note to L & L headquarters...time to review Quality Control at this locationl!!! \n\nI'm no food expert but I'm originally from Hawaii so we grew up eating L & L at the Liliha location- it may not have been the prettiest place but their food is always good.\n\nIf you are looking for decent local  plate lunches...save your time & money & make the drive to Island Flavors on Durango or Island Sushi on Eastern. Trust me.,0

"This is the closest grocery store to my apartment. \n\nI have gotten sick from the old food here 3 times over the last 2 years. Milk that smelled fine (and that was well within the sell-by date) made me violently ill. \nThis was AFTER their dairy coolers went down a couple days before, and a bunch of milk was dumped in the parking lot. \nImitation Crab meat that made me sick, and Pork Roast that went bad a week before the sell-by-date.\n\nMost of the baggers can't bag groceries properly to save their lives. \n\nMost of the cashiers (with one or two exceptions) aren't much better. \n\nNo bakery, old and spoiled food, and overpriced. \nAs others have mentioned, there's usually only one cashier working and the lines can be long.",0
"Had a mailbox with them for a few months and I really like their service. They're always really polite on the phone too. Why not 5 stars then? Because they don't seem to be reading my emails. I sent the same email request a couple of times regarding an account info change before I decided to call in myself, and my account info was updated immediately upon calling.",3
"The BF and I came for Happy Hour and sat on the patio. \n\nWe ordered\n\nMojitos- The BF wasnt very heavy on the alcohol on his classic, though my pomegranate elderflower had a good amount. \n\nAsian Trio- The eggrolls were okay, but a bit greasy. The shrimp was coated in a breading, but it wasn't crispy and they were room temperature when they got to the table. The potstickers were a weird consistency with a gumminess on the inside of the wrapper and the outside was fried yet it didn't give it any crispness...I can only tell it's fried by the bubbles created by oil on the wrapper but it wasn't left long enough to even get a golden color. It just all tasted and felt texturally like it was microwaved food. WTF?  \n\nHawaiian mini pizza- this was just alright, but it came hot and tasted like it was cooked and not microwaved. \n\nThe service was friendly and attentive so nothing wrong with the service, but the food was just sad that it doesn't really make up for it. Kudos to our server for being really good at their job! The two stars are for them and zero for the food. \n\nI don't know how \""off\"" of a day it was or if the cooks didn't care because it's late and they just want to leave...no matter-its still the job you signed up for.  It's not digesting very well either so it's the taste that keeps on giving. Ugh.. I should've gone elsewhere for dinner.",1
"Rude, boring, terrible service, took one hour to wait for chef, no water refills, never bussed dirty dishes, food plain and over cooked. Paid for lobster and it was tough. What a waste of time. Bartender rude too. Read your reviews Chandler Benihana! I really don't think they give a shat!!! Benny Hana would roll over in his grave if he knew is!",0

"I found the hotel to be clean.\n\nThe staff was all very friendly.\n\nI held a short 2 day meeting here.  The meeting facilities were great for us, including the food and the meeting planning staff and daily service team.  They were all very friendly and took care of us whenever we had a need or question.\n\nI didn't mind my room.  I found it to be roomy, with a fridge, which was handy.\n\nAs a Marriott member, I received free breakfast and free wi fi.\n\nI did not spend any time at the pools, but they did not look glamorous.  They have an OK gym, with a little cardio equipment and a few weights.\n\nI am not sure I would take little ones here, but I think for professional meetings, this is a suitable hotel in a decent location.  The planes can get a little loud above.",3
"I was reluctant to believe the reviewer who reported food poisoning, and so we eagerly ate at Julian Serrano. We thoroughly enjoyed our dinner -- the food was great and so was the service. Then I got sick the next day. And 3 days later, I'm still not able to enjoy eating. As good as that may be for my waistline, it's a pretty serious indictment of the food storage and prep at this restaurant. The food may be wonderful, but if it makes me sick, I'll never visit again.",0

"Chez Delmo se vante d'offrir un service gastronomique au quartier du Vieux Montr\u00e9al, mais la qualit\u00e9 de sa cuisine est loin d'\u00eatre \u00e0 la hauteur de ses prix. Ceux-ci pourraient \u00eatre trois fois moins chers et j'h\u00e9siterais toujours \u00e0 manger l\u00e0.\n\nJe suis all\u00e9 un jour pour le d\u00e9jeuner, ayant \u00e9t\u00e9 s\u00e9duit par son air plut\u00f4t chic et sa carte sophistiqu\u00e9e. Le menu du midi s'agissait d'une soupe de cr\u00e8me de tomates et d'un sandwich au homard accompagn\u00e9 de frites (le repas \""classique\""), le tout pour $ 19. Dispendieux, certes, mais je m'attendais a un v\u00e9ritable festin de fruits de mer dans un cadre classieux. \n\nRien de tel. La soupe \u00e9tait une soupe de bo\u00eete Campbells r\u00e9chauff\u00e9e qui avait un go\u00fbt fade et industriel, faite tr\u00e8s clairement avec du lait plut\u00f4t que de la cr\u00e8me.\n\nMais il faillait attendre le pire : plut\u00f4t qu'un beau sandwich du genre qu'on trouve facilement dans le quartier, on m'a servi, sur deux tranches de pain de mie du supermarch\u00e9, des bouts de homard surgel\u00e9s avec de la mayonnaise, cela accompagn\u00e9 d'un petit bol de frites.\n\nQui plus est, le service \u00e9tait d\u00e9sagr\u00e9able. J'avais l'impression que les serveurs me guettaient \u00e0 chaque instant pour savoir si je venais de finir un plat. Aussit\u00f4t que j'en finissais un, on me le retirait. \u00c7a donnait l'impression qu'on voulait que je mange et que je parte aussi vite que possible.\n\nPour r\u00e9sumer, donc, mangez ailleurs. La client\u00e8le habituelle est compos\u00e9e d'hommes d'affaires qui ont plus de fric que de bon go\u00fbt, ce qui aurait d\u00fb m'avertir au d\u00e9part.

"Got takeout here last night for the first time. The reception lady was very friendly and the good was great! We had noodles, edamame, rice, veggie tempura, and three rolls for under $50. Everything was great!",4
"I've been here a number of times and mostly enjoyed the food. The service is pretty mediocre but I don't blame them-- at least they try. \n\nThe eggrolls are different here, and while they aren't my cup of tea, seem to be popular among other regular patrons.\n\nThe prices are pretty fair for the amount of food you get--you'll be pretty full from just one bowl of soup. I love the traditional leaves and beansprouts that they serve alongside the pho. I always douse mine in hot sauce as well. When I've got a really bad cold, there's nothing I crave more than a steaming hot bowl of spicy, salty, hydrating pho. However, I've been elsewhere in clark county and must say that this is far from the best pho in town. Its conveniently located for me but don't settle for this place because there is much better to be had in the asian districts closer to the strip.",2
"It's nearing 4am and I'm drunk and hungry. Well imagine my delight when the lights to this quaint little pizza shop were glowing when returning to our hotel next door.\nWe crushed a few slices of various types of pizza. There was nothing really remarkable about the pizza, but it was reasonably tasty for a reasonable price. \nA solid 3 star slice, and even at this ridiculous hour it was actually the namesake of the store, Dany, working the til. A kudos to that kind of commitment to serving the za.\nThis place is indeed, A-OK.",2
"Won't be back here ever again. After numerous bad meals, we decided to only go there for drinks -mainly half price martinis on Saturday...we f'd up and came in today (Sunday) craving a martini. We waited TWENTY MINUTES for two drinks. Granted, only one person was working (so we thought) but he didn't even attempt to communicate on the delay until we said something...the worst thing was, a douche started problems with another customer which wouldn't have bothered me(I like a good show) had the TWO MANAGER/OWNERS not magically popped up to argue with the guy! If it was busy enough for our server to be in the weeds, they should've been on the floor helping the staff. just thought that was crap and we decided we wouldn't be back. that is all.",1
"The hotel sits at the end of the strip, which is nice because you can view the strip and city from the Stratosphere Tower.  The Stratosphere Tower was the high point of our vacation.  Viewing the Las Vegas Blvd  at night after a fun-filled day was peaceful and relaxing.  The staff in the Tower was friendly and helpful.\n\nThe hotel staff was not as friendly as the staff in the  Tower was. But with that said,  The hotel has a Starbucks which was a nice way start our day, but pricey. \nWe didn't play at the Casino at all so I can't review it.  I can add that it was well vented and we didn't suffer from the smokers, as we walked through it daily to get to our other Casino destinations.\n\nThe hotel is old but is in the process of being renovated. Our upgraded room was clean with the exception of the bathroom floor.  I'm not sure how they clean it between guest but I got athlete's foot from the dirty floor.  Our room was on the 12th floor and we had a great view of the mountains. We came back to our rooms nightly and found the clean and ready for us.",2
"My flight got in very late, so I checked in around 1AM. Strangely, I still had to wait in line, even though there was a second check-in person available. I had an early morning interview the next day, so I asked about taxis, and was told there would be one waiting for me at 7:45 AM. The room was comfortable and clean, but as other reviewers have pointed out, the hotel is showing its age. Bathroom was small and had little counter space, but there was a large counter outside the bathroom. Sink and shower drains were very slow. All in all, the room was fine, though.\n\nI don't usually order room service, but because I had the early interview and knew I wouldn't have time to run out in search of breakfast, I ordered room service for 7AM by hanging the card on the outside doorknob. The card said to hang before 2AM, and I hung mine around 1:30AM. I woke up in the morning to find a useless USA Today sitting outside my door, but the card was still there. Needless to say, breakfast never came.\n\nI made it downstairs at 7:45 to find no taxi. I asked at the front desk, and they told me there was another person also waiting for a taxi to the same place, so we could share. I found this person, and it turns out she had been waiting since 7:30. A taxi pulled up and we told her where we were going, but the driver mumbled something about not wanting to go there and drove off. We were almost late for the interview because it took a long time for the hotel staff to get another taxi there. So, if you need a taxi from this hotel, you might want to look into reputable companies on your own or just leave plenty of time!\n\nPerk--there was a free shuttle downtown, and I was able to take it to the Megabus stop which was nice, since the weather was terrible. The driver was very nice.\n\nAll in all, I'm glad I got a great deal through Hotwire. It is probably not worth whatever the hotel normally charges for a room.",1
"Went here today, March 19/12, and we totally enjoyed our meals.  This place is not fancy and, in fact is the anti-fancy, but we don't care so long as the food is good.\n\nI had the Red Jade Chicken, which was crispy deep fried deliciousness, along with the Egg Foo Yung.  My sides were Jerk Fried Rice and Black Beans.  Everything was really good and nothing was greasy.  I wasn't too sure about such a combo but I'll be ordering that same combo next time I go.  My hubby had the Quesadilla and I believe it had only cheese but then you'd get a little bite of ginger which popped that Quesadilla up to another level.  It was really good and, again, not oily.  He also had the Chinese Barbecued Pork, along with the Black Beans and Chicken Fried Rice and I asked him if he'd order the same again and he said, \""You bet!\"" so he definitely enjoyed his meal as well.  To top it off, they delivered our meals to the table with cookies for dessert and I'm here to say that those cookies were very, very good.  Can't beat a free cookie either!  \n\nNeedless to say, we were both really full when we left.",3
"I absolutely love this place! I have been several times, always on a Tuesday to take advantage of their Taco Tuesday special. It's 3 tacos for $5 your choice of pork, fish or chicken (mix and match) My personal favorite is the fish.  They serve you your tacos in corn tortillas with cheese melted on top, then it's off to the taco bar! Yup, you get to dress up your own tacos however your heart desires.  The taco bar includes lettuce, cabbage, cilantro, diced tomatoes, green sauce and their baja sauce (delicious but very spicy!)  You can't beat this deal... especially when you pair them with some of their ICEY (and I mean ICEY!) cold beer, which is served by the glass or pitcher.\n\nThe last time we went my husband was not in the mood for tacos so he opted for their bison burger (added blue cheese crumbles and bacon) and it was delish!  Our server, Pam, was a delight.  She was very personable, very funny and made us feel at home.  \n\nThere are plenty of televisions inside as well as a pool table. Seating includes booths, high tops and the bar top inside.  Outside on their full service, smoking patio (which is air conditioned!!!) there is a second bar as well as at least 10 more hightops.  I believe there are also 2 more TV's outside behind the bar. \n\nAnd to those who feel the need to comment on the decor and refer to it as a dive, you need to hop in your car and head about 15 miles east. it's a place called Scottsdale... you can enjoy the company of your fellow douche bags there.",4
"Dinner of Christmas Day was great - attentive service without being stuffy, delicious food, and great atmosphere.",3
"A little greek gem that's family ownedand operated :) Food was really tasty,  got their hummus special,  the roasted red pepper & cilantro hummus,  falafel with fries. Yummmy! I'm glad or waiter suggested to go with the special hummus today.\n\nService was amazing and ambiance was nice and chill.  Great spot for a quick lunch.  Def will be coming back again.",4
"This place is quite tastey.  The portions are huge, you can definately split an entree.  The second best pastrami sandwich I've ever had, but well above average none the less!\n\nIt's worth a trip for lunch if you're in the area.",3
"I've heard about this place for years and seen it on multiple TV channels.  It's been known as the best pizza in America so I finally gave it a try. I was told the wait would be about a hour for a group of 4, however it only took 20 minutes. They have a house next door you can wait at that serves wine. We ordered 2 pizzas, and both were amazing!!!  Just the right amount of cheese and sauce. It wasn't too thick and perfectly crispy. Perfect for date night!",3
"Was visiting the fountain with some out of town friends and came across this coffee shop. Great location and staff and great selection of drinks as well as free wi-fi. The shop is long and narrow but seating is comfortable and modern. I would definitely ask Ashley to whip you up a drink. She made an excellent Milkyway one for me. I'm not a coffee fan per se but for anyone in the Fountain Hills area,  this is a great location to go to.",4
"This has to be the worst restaurant in Las Vegas! To start with, I think it's the only  italian restaurant I've ever been to  that charges you for mediocre bread. The portions are a joke and incredibly overpriced considering how small and uninteresting they are. I ordered the chicken which was the smallest chicken I've ever seen. It tasted average at best, and I was still hungry after dinner. The waiter was reluctant to give us breadsticks (made it sound like he did us a favor swiping them off the bar) and we paid $5 for \""stromboli\"" bread which was average at best. \nEveryone who works there seems unhappy and look like they don't want to be there, and the overall experience was awful. If I could rate it a zero I would. The entire experience was unpleasant, food unsatisfying, terrible menu, broken pizza over and apathetic service. I would never return and suggest you don't go either.",0
"I would've given it 5 stars because I did have a lot of fun! However, the boys I were with were dying! It's hot enough as it is in Vegas, they definitely need to add some fans in the outside areas. Drinks are pricy, but that's the same anywhere in Vegas. Other than the heat situation, the ambiance was great! Music was great, no other complaints here.",3
The place is a dump.  The service is frequently spotty.  The food is STELLAR!,3
"Our group had a wonderful lunch experience. Melissa was a great server, meeting our needs before we asked. The food came out quickly. The food was hot and flavorful.  Definitely will return.",4
"Came for lunch on a Saturday- they open AT 11:30, not one second before- we were shoo'ed back when we tried to have a seat at the bar 3 minutes beforehand. AYCE, but sitting at the sushi bar we were not allowed to order from the sushi chef, the waitress would take the order, then reach in front of us and hand the slip to the chef.  Sushi was okay, but I won't be back.  The waitress was condescending in attitude, not sure what they were going for-",1
"There are only about 6 tables inside, if you don't want to sit outside you might be waiting a while.  The outside patio is beautiful.  I got biscuits and gravy, I have definitely had better.  I wasn't impressed.  They did have chocolate caramel creamer for my coffee though, I was pretty excited about that.  I don't think we will go back.",2
"We were anxiously awaiting our favorite sports bar so once we found out they opened on Friday, we were there for grand opening happy hour. Wings were perfect (golden medium with a side of hot) wife got her fave (Monnoco Foccacia). Food came out quickly and accurately despite being full to capacity and a 30 min wait to sit. Beer was ice cold in a frozen mug. Service was friendly and we were greeted by one of the owners and the manager. Needless to say we will be back as they have consistently served us great food no matter which location.",4
"A party of 7 - we drank water 1 appetizer and a $600 check all in the confines of an indoor mall...\nDon't get me wrong, the food was wonderful but just a bit out of hand.  2 pairs of people ordered the same entree items and they came out completely different sizes and  for myself, the shrimp was just not delicious.  For 36 bucks I wants some delicious shrimp!\nThe server was by far the worst server I've ever encountered!  I wanted to read the menu but he insisted on up-selling every freaking thing!!  Dude back the f-up, I wanna read, not hear the ingredients in a rue! He kept interrupting our rather enjoyable conversation to tell us about \""artisinal water\"" or some other crap they've up-charged for.  Frankly at the end of the night I felt like I was just sold a used car with a side of fish...  Hey Rick, time to rethink your wait staff.  This one waiter RUINED your restaurant...",0
"Margiotta is an institution in Marchmont.  For me, it sums up that whole area of town.  Very nice, but slightly overpriced.  As people have already said, it is just like any other corner shop, but just with a better quality of product and a higher price.  It does seem to satisfy those well-off residents of Marchmont and students alike - clearly they are placed well for their target market.\n\nIf I lived in that part of town, I imagine I wouldn't frequent there all too often.  Yes, it is convenient, but if you walk a little bit further to Tesco in Newington, or even Sainsbury's on the Quartermile, you will find a better range for a lower price.  It is good to be able to say that you've used Margiotta though - it might give you a good conversation starter for the next time you visit a friend in Marchmont.",2
I have been there several times. It is a real treat. There are only two problems. They don't heat the buns. The burger is nice and perfect and they stick it on a cold bun. Why?? The second problem is the bathroom is a pit.,3
"The actual hotel is pretty nice.  It is clean, comfortable, nice pool and nice workout room.  The location is good as well.  \n\nMy complaint is about the customer service.  They promised us a full refund if we canceled rooms.  We had to cancel some rooms because we had a big group and less people came then expected one of the nights.  They didn't tell us we needed to do a 3 night minimum so we were stuck paying a much more expensive rate for the two nights we stayed there.  They wouldn't do anything about it.  They also didn't have my room available until 4:30.  The staff was very unhelpful altogether.",1
"If you are in a rush, do not order any hot food (anything with eggs/bacon/etc).  On different orders on different days, we had fairly long delays (30+ minutes).  They have to get that from the back kitchen, which is apparently slow and/or far.  Otherwise, the other stuff is a fine way to use your resort/food/etc credit.",1
"This Starbucks is always so darn friendly! Never a bad service!\n\nWhat can I say? I'm a repeat customer. Why? Well, not only because they're darn friendly! Also because they offer more than coffee! Their coffee is great and all, but I really enjoy trying their panini's and refreshers. Yum!\n\nI am amazed at how consistently happy and courteous the customer service is here. Is it like this at all Starbucks? I may never know. I like it too much here to try anywhere else on purpose. \n\nI've been to other Starbucks and the service varies. Here, it's awesome all the time! Not only are their cold green tea Refreshers refreshing, so is the service and atmosphere!",4
"Amazing, wow, heart stopping, edge of your seat watching good time. From start to finish  your hooked. Great cast that you love cheering for and hating saying goodbye too. 90 minutes of peer joy and excitement. The tickets were a gift but if I could afford them I would go again. Thanks for a night to remember.",4
"I had recently taken a trip to Cali and needed to wash all the dead bugs off my car.  I took my vehicle to the Fabulous Freddy's on Durango and was not blown away.\n\nOverall the staff was nice, the lady who greeted me when I pulled up was friendly and the cashier was great and very welcoming.  \n\nMy biggest complaint is that after purchasing the VIP wash that my car was not all that clean.  There were still aftermath of the dead bugs on my good as well as water spots on the lower windshield.  Ended up having to wipe it down when I got home.",2
"I got Mahi Mahi and Spicy Chicken. The Mahi Mahi was ok, nothing special. The spicy chicken was good, not great. The amount of rice was for 4 people. Personally I like Island Flavor much more! This was typical fast food Hawaiian food type of restaurant.",1
"Chile verde was awesome - really awesome.  Pancakes and eggs were both reliable. Potatoes were yummy. No cappucino, only coffee, but good coffee.  We had to wait for some time on a Sunday morning, but I would wait again.",3
"I had never had Ethiopian food before, so I wasn't sure what to expect. I was pleasantly surprised - the food was delicious. But the dining experience was terrible. They seemed understaffed for a Friday night - one waitress and one cook for a full restaurant. It took us around an hour to get our food, and when we did, our waitress had forgotten half of it. She apologized profusely and made it sound like she normally didn't wait tables, but it was frustrating. Our portions were also -very- small (which was strange, every other table seemed to have enormous heaping plates...maybe we ordered wrong!) and I left hungry. \n\nI'd like to give it another chance, because the food was very good, but I'm really hesitant.",1
"It was like some strange vortex enveloped the table and took us to another dimension.. from the second the waiter man handled my hot dog.. uhm, err.. let me start from the beginning...\n\nWe decided to wait a while before trying a the new corporate chain at Scottsdale Fashion.. you know how the weeks following opening day can be be well, iffy. So with that in mind and have tried the burgers at the Vegas location, knew that this might be fun. Insane huge menu, large portions and affordable prices. Upon arrival (parking is really bad since they tore down the east structure) we were greeted by a very friendly foh person and were seated immediately. The space is cavernous and was actually quite empty for a Thursday night. \n\nAfter looking over the book of a menu decided on the Kobe Beef Hot Dogs as an app.. Blue Cheese Salad.. The Max Burger .. and Short Rib Sloppy Joe. This sounds like a sort of high end Weinershnitzel or something? The server had 3 tables and she seemed a bit flustered when she finally approached us. She was a pretty neat person and was very friendly but after placing our order things started to go wrong.\n\nAfter about 20 minutes our Kobe Beef Hot Dog app showed up.. seriously, come on, the place was empty! Well the dogs are stacked high on thick buttered Texas toast.. well when the waiter set them down he lost control and one of the dogs fell off the plate and onto my bread plate.. well, no biggie right? Wrong, he reaches over and grabs my hot dog with his bare hand while mentioning 'Jesus' as he was doing it. You'd think I would have at least gotten a kiss first? He puts the hot dog back on the serving plate and walks off mentioning he would get us another one. After about 10 minutes the manager comes over (very friendly) and gives us his apologies about the hot dog man handling. Fortunately he had a replacement with him and took the app off the bill. Let me tell you though, if you can order only one thing of the menu, these are it! Seriously.\n\nBlue Cheese Salad showed up as a Chopped Salad *sigh*, drinks sat empty, bread bowl empty,  manhandled Jesus hot dog still in my head. The entrees finally showed up, this is a good hour after being sat in a mostly empty space. Just kept humming 'Things Can Only Get Better' (still love Howard Jones), ah happy place! The The Max Burger was room temperature and the cheese was just sitting on top in that sort of I'm trying to melt stage.. not good. At that point I was so over it! Now the Short Rib Sloppy Joe was pretty darn good! Piping hot and full of that familiar 'manwich'  flavor, reminded me of being in grade school again, those were the days. Hmm, now I remember why I was always the fat kid in school.. \n\nOrdered desserts.. New Orleans Beignets.. Deep Dark Fudge Cake.. and Banana Cream Pie.. after some time the desserts finally showed up.. the Beignets were HUGE.. Ive never seen a Beignet that large before.. comes with 3 dipping sauces.. while big they were just alright in taste.. I prefer the smaller ones as they aren't as doughy.. Deep Dark Fudge Cake, oh yeah! This was almost as good as the chocolate cake at Coronado Cafe.. dense, chewy intense choco- curl-your-toes yumminess! The Banana Cream Pie, well, just order the Deep Dark Fudge Cake.. not so much on that one.. thick hard graham pie shell covered with pastry cream, brown bananas and so much whipped cream you would think they were trying to hide something, hmm, brown bananas anyone?\n\nI still think it was some sort of Vortex that we got sucked into. The nice manager came over and I joked around with him about my theory. Apparently he thought it was so funny he offered to take care of the desserts and invited us to 'please give us another chance'. He did mention that if they try to seat us at that table again, ask to be moved. Im not sure if I will come back to Grand Lux unless I bring a spiritual guide and a set of tongs for the manhandling hot dog waiter.",1
"I went in for a sandwich and I asked for it on sliced bread. They told me, \""We can't do that.\"" What do you mean? You mean to tell me you can't do sliced bread? \n\""We can't do that because it's not on the menu.\"" \n\nI can't begin to tell you how flabbergasted this leaves me.\n\nThey agreed to put it on sliced bread, because it's a sandwich shop and that's ridiculous. I then asked if they had chili paste, as every other Capriotti's I've been to does. The cashier proceeded to tell me oh no, the soup of the day isn't chili. \n\nI had to leave. I couldn't deal with it. I love Capriotti's, just not this one.",0
"Excellent, tasty food, but no table service or margaritas. You walk up & order. We really need a Mex place exactly like this but with waiters & a bar. Or... add a drive thru",3
"So glad this place opened up so close to where I live! I came here because my cousin mentioned it to me and can't believe how many times I drove past it without even noticing. Definitely one of those place that you \""don't judge a book by its cover\"". The inside decor is beautifully set up. \n\nSushi is really good, love the fact they have a brown rice option that I can't get that at other places. The eel cucumber roll was pretty good for a light roll that will will not fill you up too much so, I think I might go for the eel avocado though next time I come. Also I'm pretty sure I fell in love the gyoza and the light dipping sauce that they have. Seriously it was cooked perfectly.\n\nWill definitely come back again!",3
"Remember when the beauty of Yucca Tap was that there were no taps? Well times, they have a changed.\n\nIm a fan of the redesigned stage area in the main room. The addition of a credit card machine is super as well. Kudos to the owners for opening the other side where the old italian sub shop was. Yucca has food! And its good! Love the craft beer fridges and taps on the new side as well.\n\nI recommend going to the new side for beer, they really do have a great selection, and going to the old side or Yucca classic for a mixed drink.",3
This is a great place for both chiropractic work and therapeutic and massages.  I've been going for 3+ years.,4
God food but not worth the prices they charge.,2
"Eh.  It was my first Quizno's.  My buddies all prefer it over subway -- apparently the quality of the meat is supposed to be better.  It wans't.  Not here at least.\n\nFirstly I want to mention is that I LOVE the fact you can watch Subway artisans (I think hat's what they're called right?) stuff the sandwich in front of you.  Here it's kinda more hidden and not as open.  That's fine.\n\nThe sandwich came out OK.  I prefer the meat at Subway more and the ingredients seemed fresher at Subways I've been to than this Quiznos.  Oh well.  It was OK.\n\nOh yeah.  The bag that your subs come in rip on the bottom if the sandwich rests against it.  That' kinda screwed half my sandwich.  I'm not counting that against them though, just an FYI for Quizno virgins like me.",2
"This certainly isn't a spot I'd go every week but for a special occassion (family visiting, etc) it's a great spot to grab breakfast or brunch.  The farm is a lovely setting.  If you haven't been there before there are a few restaurants on the property.  This one is in the far back.  I found the food to be very good (better than the other casual eatery at the front).  The ingredients are super fresh (you can see the veggies being grown next to the restaurant) and the portions were sized appropriately.  \n\nThe cost is on the high side for a breakfast but again, you're paying for atmosphere as well.  Give it a go but expect a long wait on weekends.",3
"I just started working in the central phoenix area, and have to say that Cheese n stuff quickly became my favorite lunch stop around.   They use boar's head meats/cheese on their sandwiches and other quality ingredients in their sides.  The shop is small and quirky, and it's probably best as a carry-out location (they do have some tables inside, and although I've never seen all seats filled, I suppose that's a possibility). \n \nIts reasonably priced, with a gigantic menu and selection.  Their breakfast sandwich is delicious, as is everything I've had for lunch.  In fact, on more than one occasion where I have gone for breakfast and lunch in the same day.\n\nIf you like sandwiches, and miss east coast deli's, this place is for you.",4
"BEWARE OF BAD SERVER named Angei.  (6) of us attempted to have a nice meal at El Chorro last night to kick off the first day of Arizona Restaurant Week.  This was my second visit to El Chorro and the first for everyone else.\n\nOur server Angei appeared to be in her first hour of being employed as a server and kicked off the worst night of dining in my life by being completely clueless about Gluten allergies (my sister-in-law has a Gluten allergy).  The restaurant week menu specifically stated that there were Gluten-free options.  When we asked which options were Gluten-free she had no idea what was Gluten-free on the restaurant week menu or the regular  Gluten-free menu.   We sent her off to the kitchen to in quire about the Gluten-free option.  She came back to our table twice more in the next (20) minutes with no answer other than \""We were told the only Gluten-free option was the vegetarian pasta.\""   She actually had the nerve to ask us what would be in their own dishes that would contain Gluten.  How on earth are we to know how they prepare the menu.  She claimed that she had spoken to the chef but she obviously made that story up.\n\nAfter these (2) attempts we finally demanded that she send a manager to our table.  (10) minutes later the manager arrived armed with the Gluten-free menu for El Chorro to help eliminate the confusion.  As he learned from us the confusion was on the part of Angei who had never brought us a Gluten-free menu even though we looked it up on the restaurant's own website and showed her this evidence on our iPhones.  She claimed the Gluten-free status must have been a misprint.\n\nBy this point we are now (45) minutes into the dining experience and just placing our order.  Fast forward another (45) minutes and after a combined hour and a half our young children are now starving and fussy because they are tired of sitting in a restaurant.   My wife and the (2) young children had to leave before the first course even arrived.  When departing my wife went to the front hostess and complained about the poor quality of the service and asked a manager to look into this.  No one ever came by to check on us the balance of evening.  Had they done so we would have shared our experience with them in vivid detail.  We then had everything thereafter boxed table side because Angei stated it was too difficult for the kitchen to box up the courses for my wife.  Even that process was difficult to communicate as we had to remind her to bring additional boxes and tell her it would be inadvisable to place a scoop of ice cream in a cardboard box with a hot piece of chocolate cake that we would attempt to rush to my wife (at home starving with two young kids) 30 minutes away.\n\nBefore the main course arrived she came to the table bearing news that they were out of the dessert feature we had ordered and told us they had a chocolate torte (which turned out to be a chocolate lava cake) and then asked which dessert we would like to choose.  We didn't have a choice but the torte so why ask us which option we prefer.  Torte or nothing?\n\nWhen we finally received dessert my sister-in-law with the Gluten allergy thought she would enjoy the ice cream only on her dessert plate only to find that whatever utensil had been used to dish the ice cream had been previously used to dish something with a cake or cookie consistency thereby cross-contaminating Gluten into her ice cream which will most likely make her very ill in the upcoming hours.  \n\nAngei had (3) tables.  (2) were 2-tops and ours was a 6-top that became a 3-top.  Every single request (water, soda, etc.) took (10) minutes minimum to be fulfilled.  Our table was collecting spent plates, glasses, etc. that never left our sight.\n\nThe simplest of instructions seemed to be received as complex to Angei as diffusing a bomb.  We repeated our requests and answered her questions more than once on several occasions.\n\nAt the end of the night we requested that my brother and his wife have a separate check than my family only to be told that they did not have that ability but if we told her how much to put on each credit card she could do that.  She didn't seem to understand that was the same exact outcome with the only difference being that we would be responsible for sitting at the table and calculating our own bills.\n\nThe food was very good from first course to dessert but the service was the worst I have received in my life.  This individual should have been set free in a sit down restaurant where the meals were $5.00 on average.  Instead we averaged $50.00 per person and could have received better service from the bus boys.\n\nI know that this is probably the first real weekend for the outdoor patio seating at El Chorro which looks like it doubles their capacity so perhaps Angei is one of the new players on the team, but it is completely unacceptable that any patrons, particularly first time visitors during restaurant week, be treated to sub-par service like this.",0
"I've gone to this store more than a handful of times. I usually stop in for their ribbon, and die-cuts since I do not own a cricut machine. The times I've been in employees have been friendly and I never have to wait to get rung up. You can also sign up for their email list which shows monthly promotions and current classes youc an sign up for.\n\nI will be returning in the future.",2
The burger here is cheap at $4.95. It comes with potato salad on the side or you can pay extra for French fries. The burger meat tasted old and yucky. The fries were good though. The price is cheap though and it's on Fremont.,1
"Was in the area because I got suckered into stopping for some pie, those dang signs!!! And was walking towards the gas station and saw Herbs & More, now I love Herb shops,  they are quite interesting for me, it amazes me on how herbs can be used for natural cures.  \n\nThe real reason why I stopped in was for the & More, I was looking crystals, sometimes they are sold were herbs are at and I wanted to check out what they had.  Unfortunately I didn't find any, but the store does have a lot of offer, I did see a lot of herbs, even have dragons blood, if you are looking to cook up a love spell, dragon blood I heard is helpful haha. \n\nIt was a nice shop full of helpful information and I'm sure if you came in with a real need the sales lady would be more than helpful for finding what you seek.",2
"Very cool place to go and chill out and get away from the lights and hustle and bustle of the strip and casinos.\n\nAfter a very brief intro speech to the park you pretty much get to wander and see what you want when you want.  You can sit on a small wall and be like a foot away from the dolphins that come up when the trainers are there.  I'd like to do that \""be a trainer for a day\"" but I'm not sure how much that'd cost - kinda scared to ask.\n\nThere was a 9 week old leopard cub that was there so we got to see him, \""Java\"" (see pics link) and there were give younger tigers in one section too with a trainer inside answering questions.  The guy was way cool and super helpful about all the questions people were throwing at him.  Also white tigers, white lions, black panther, leopards, and out of left field was some alpaca's... \nGoing underneath the pool and watching the dolphins zip around is always cool to me at least.  One of them just had a baby a few months back too so there was a little one (see pics link).\n\nIt's no zoo by any means for but $15 bucks it's totally worth it.\n\nI've got our pictures up here: http://is.gd/hEl9",3
"This was a real find, courtesy of the young woman at the reception of the Auberge Bonaparte. Cafe Stash features excellent Polish food; pierogi, sausage and sauerkraut, hunters stew, and a variety of other specialties. D\u00e9cor is Polish lodge, and service very fast. I highly recommend Caf\u00e9 Stash for lunch or dinner in Old Montreal.   This is a moderately priced restaurant.",3
"My home is 1300 sq. feet.  I decided I wanted my entire home in laminate flooring.  I called Empire because they were having a 60% off special and their ads boasts next-day installation.  The rep that came to my house was very nice and professional.  However, after measuring the floor she informed us it would cost a whopping $13,000!  This amount was way over budget, especially for a no-name brand of flooring.  Plus, we had already removed the previous flooring and base boards so all we needed was product and installation.  Naturally, we declined and the sales rep was polite an left us her card.\n\nWe ended up going with Lowe's who had a .99 cent per square foot installation on Pergo and Armstrong laminate flooring.  Today makes 2 weeks since we ordered our Pergo flooring and it is just want I wanted!  Out the door, we paid 7k for product, taxes, delivery, and installation.  Although it wasn't next-day installation, it was worth the wait to save $6,000!",0
"$65.00 dollars for a family of 3, and that is with a $4 off coupon. We were extremely disappointed in our trip. The whole place smell of feces and urine, now I understand that it is zoo, but it was horrible. In the reptile exhibit, we believe that we saw what was a dead snake. Most of the animals did not have food or WATER, its 107 degrees outside, give the animals some WATER. The map was not accurate. The best part was the aquarium and the only inside building that didn't smell awful. I will that we could have asked for some type of refund but my husband pointed out that there was  a NO REFUNDS sign on the way in. Totally not worth the money, gas, or my time.",0
"This review is not in regards to the food. It was very good, I liked the egg rolls and the orange chicken tasted very authentic. Although, my boyfriend and I sat down and the server mentioned something we couldn't quite understand as we sat he came to mention how handsome my boyfriend was? Thanks but making a pass at my boyfriend with me there is not only rude but awkward. Then proceeded to say I have to say you are beautiful because I told him he is handsome. Well thanks for the not needed added comment. And for hurting my feelings.",0
We ordered the mussels here and my husband was throwing up later that evening.   I think he ate a bad one.  You have to be really careful when cooking those things as  they can make people VERY sick if not cooked properly.  I wouldn't eat here again.,0
"The place is pretty cool but a little creepy, reminds me of that movie Cabin Boy from 1994 with Chris Elliot, man that was a bad movie. Anyway they serve the beers in stemed goblets and there is a small dance floor. Didnt try the food but it smelled okay.",2
"It has been about 6 months since we were at Flo's last. We used to frequent Flo's on a regular basis and it was one of our favorites in town for Chinese food. There lunch prices have gone up to about $9. I understand the need to increase prices, but the half dinner portion that used to be half the price for lunch is now only a few dollars cheaper than dinner and still half the size. You do get a salad with lunch,but it is essentially iceberg lettuce with a little dressing. I would spend the few dollars more for a dinner portion if you like having leftovers. I ordered the Moo goo gai pan as usual. It came out without any chicken. I let our waiter know that there was no chicken and he took the dish away without apology. I waited for about 15 minutes while the rest of my party ate there lunch. Another gentleman brought out a new and improved Moo goo with chicken, but without a word of apology. I then realized that it was almost bone dry and did not have any more than a glisten of sauce. I asked the waiter who delivered my dish for some sauce because the dish didn't seem to have any. He said \""oh , you would like some extra sauce\"" and I said no I would just like some sauce on the dish as it appears that it was left off. He returned with a small cup of sauce, again without a word. I felt badly wasting almost the entire cup as I only wanted a couple of spoonfuls not a drowning plate, but did appreciate some sauce finally about 25 minutes after my party received there food. I was incredibly disappointed by the mistakes and service. This used to be a favorite and I hope that they were just having an off day, but we will not be back.",1
"So before this review, I wrote about how much I loved Flict salon. Unfortunately, times have changed.\n\nMy cousin was over for a wedding and had never dyed her hair before. She liked my red ombr\u00e9, so I decided to take her to Nicole, the hairstylist who did my hair. My cousin has long, curly, thick black hair. I do too, but her hair is longer, curlier, and darker than mine. When I got my hair done before, Nicole did a great job. She lightened my hair before adding the color, so that it would show up. \n\nThis time however, she did not lighten my cousin's hair. The color, as common sense would provide, did not take to her hair. I told Nicole I didn't see any difference, but she said that we should go outside and look at it in the sunlight. That didn't really help... I still couldn't tell the difference. Nicole took my cousin back to lighten her hair. I trusted her to work wonders, like she did on my hair.\n\nShe lightened about two small strands of my cousin's hair. She put the color, and this time it took. It just looked terrible that she only had two red strands while the rest of her hair was black. My cousin has A LOT of hair... At this point we've been in the salon for 6 hours. We were told to come back the next day to make her hair look even and have an appointment with the owner. \n\nI forget the owner's name.. I think it was Helen. The owner would take good care of us... Right? Wrong. She finished up my cousin's hair so it looked presentable. She then continued to charge us $300! She included the fee for the botched hair job Nicole provided. I was paying for INVISIBLE hair dye! My hair cut and color had costed less than $150. It was ridiculous that we had to pay so much for the hair stylist's mistake. You'd think the owner would care more about the actual customers, and not how much money to suck out of them. It made me sad, but I vowed to never go back to Flict. Now I'm looking for a new hairstylist. Any suggestions?",0
"Wow, went to Romanelli's today for the first time, this place not only smells fantastic, the food is awesome!  Do not wait, go there....now!  I had the Italian sub, it was wonderful and only $4.95 for a half, which is plenty for one person.",4
"Maybe biased since we paid only $120/night, but pretty awesome. Rooms are like mini suites, crisp modern look/feel, valet included, free wifi. Highly recommend as long as you're ok with no casino.  Bellagio and Aria casinos are just 5 minute walk though.",4
"The only reason that they get two stars is that my fianc\u00e9 likes them. I have never ordered a single dish I have actually liked or filled me up. It is overpriced for quality and quantity. Don't get the chicken parm!...flattened piece of chicken that tasted like chemicals and there was NO pasta with it. Who does a chicken parm without pasta? I ordered it \""to go\"" and didn't check to see what I was getting. My poor decision to their poor food quality.",1
"I was looking for a better pizza than my Little Caesars or Dominos near my home. Being the discounter, I found that Papa John's had a decent pizza for a nice price. I built my pie online and set up a carryout option with cash payment. Soon I received a confirmation email with all my order information and an ETA of about 20 mins or so. I sent my boyfriend within ten mins to go pick our dinner up. When he arrived, the front counter attendant couldn't find our pizza; leaving Joe to wait an additional thirty mins or so. (He was at the correct location) The attendant then handed my boyfriend TWO pizzas. Clearly, not our order!!  After finding what they thought was our pie based on the ingredient selection, it was luke warm at best and had a sticker for a different client and phone number. I was EXTREMELY disappointed with our experience. I never write reviews-certainly not a bad one-; however, I needed to tell you readers.... Rosati's is worth the gas OR try another location.",0
"Good ol Rum Runner aka The Badger Cafe!!! Me and my wife love this place, and have been frequent customers since 2009. Its a low key bar for Packer fans(blah), located in the Central section off Eastern and Trop. They serve alot of different bar food varieties and tend to mainly locals. I wouldnt know anything about any of the food on their menu besides the popular Build Your Own Burger. Now a couple years back, it use to only be $3.99 w/most of the toppings for free and .75 cent fries. Fast foward to 2014, and similar to gas, prices have rised. It's now $4.99 still most of the toppings are free, however cheese and fries are both $1.00 even. I would always get one with all the free toppings(onions, grilled onions, lettuce, mayo, 1000 island and pickles), bacon and swiss(f*ckin delicious). My wifey would get the same except she would add avacado and tomato for an additional .75 cents each. Back in 09', our total would come out to a lil under $13 bucks. Now 2 weeks ago, we came here and we got the same thing(minus the bacon) and the amount came out to $16.85 to be exact!! Also, wifey always orders hers medium rare and I order medium well, both burgers were well done. A lil bit to well done and a bit on the overcooked side. Nonetheless, aside from the slight rise in the prices and this one hiccup, they have been pretty consistent over the 5 years we've been going to them. Even with the rise in pricing, this burger still beats ANY and EVERY fast food joint in town(not named In-N-Out). Love em and cant wait till the next visit.",3
some of the best cocktails in phoenix. food is delicious but not intimidating.,3
"First of all, like everyone else, I've wanted to try this place. I've heard fabulous things about it but never had the chance to go. So about two months ago, my friend is staying at a casino across the street from Imperial Palace. She and her friends were craving breakfast food and not a buffet so I said we could try this place. \n\nI arrived and told the hostess that my friends were already in there. She told me, (and not even kindly), \""We don't seat parties if they aren't all here, but you can check if they're in there.\"" Well, they were seated and I joined them and we ordered our food. \n\nFirst of all, I give the food a 4 out of 5 -- Chris and I had the farmer's platter or whatever it was called and although it was good, there was just toooooo much of it. I think there's a difference between good and thinking something's good just because they put 5 pounds of food on your plate. \n\nSecond, the service was second...no, wait...third rate. I have lived in Vegas for almost 10 years and seriously, I've had better service when Binion's Horseshoe had their steak and potato midnight special for $2.99. Drinks were not refilled in a timely manner and when asked for a refill, the waitress seemed annoyed. \n\nThird, this place was way too crowded and not enough servers. Come on now...I've eaten at the Cheesecake Factory and you're practically sitting on their neighbor's lap as you enjoy your meal with your dining patron and you still don't get the rudeness or the stress that you can sense from the waitstaff. This way not be their problem so then the management needs to get a clue. \n\nFourth, as we were paying our bill, it took about 10 minutes for the waitress to come back. Upon arrival, she tells us that between the kitchen at our table, she \""LOST\"" our credit card. So not only was she a bit on the rude side, the was obviously tied up doing several other things AND she loses my husband's credit card??!!? COME ON!!! There had to have been at least 200 people in the restaurant and anyone would've picked it up and taken it. About 5-7 minutes later, I guess someone turned it in to the hostess and the hostess tried to find the waitress to give it to her. My hubby then got it from the hostess and although the waitress did apologize, you could so tell that she apologized really to save face and get us out of there. After that, I wanted to take the tip we had left for her. Normally I'm not so mean, but my husband is a busser and he wouldn't be that rude to anyone! \n\nI give this place two stars because the food really was good, but just overrated. I do think it's worth a try...and maybe not the IP location. Maybe Sahara is different...and when the M location opens up, then they have a chance to prove me wrong. We'll see...\n\nSo Hash House a Go-go management at IP, if you want people to  pay way too much for pancakes, you can afford one more server or busser so your existing waitstaff isn't  running around forgetting people's orders, losing people's credit card or cutting people short to take care of others with a stressed out and uncaring attitude. 4 farmer's platters can pay a waiter's 4 hour shift and they'd provide better service so they can generate MORE money for your joint!",1
"I have an addiction to frozen yogurt these days and Yogurt Builderz is a place I have been frequenting. I love how that you can choose your own cup size, your not stuck with a huge bucket to fill up. \nThe coconut is def my fav but the oreo cookie and vanilla bean are very tasty as well. I guess its all low fat but at this point I really don't care since I will be adding all the sinful toppings! I'm a topping maniac and I pretty much add everything that has chocolate in it. And the mochi which I love! I just pick it off the top of my yogurt and pop them in my mouth and let them melt.....mmmmmm.\nThis place is in a great location in Scottsdale and will def be hopping over the summer!",3
"I'm eager to go back and try more dishes!\n\nI ordered an array of contemporary sushi pieces. I told the sushi chef what fish I was in the mood for (akami tuna, hirame, fluke, hamachi) and he created some spectacular duos (see pictures) - the fish was definitely fresh, although some of his creations were better than others, and some were overpowered by his use of greens, resulting in lack of flavor; Which is why I only give them 4 stars. \n\nThe Black Cod soy was phenomenal, but I recommend you share it with someone as the tastes can be a little too much after a few bites.\n\nThey have an excellent Sake menu as well. Service was sub par as far as politeness. One of the servers actually shouted across the restaurant while we were dining, so I'm not immediately jumping in my car to try this place again- maybe in a few months.",3
"I didn't know what to expect when going to this haunted house, but when I got there, it really scared me and my friends.  We had a great time!",4
"Bonfire seemed like a new place. I liked the aroma emanating from the place one night and my boss and I went there for lunch.  I was surprised that we were the only ones in there. Not a good sign. But there is a lot of competition as plenty of good eateries are concentrated in Old Town Scottsdale. The decor is dark and very wooden -- reminded a bit of an hipster version of Stuart Anderson's Black Angus. A couple of TVs played college football games. The music was Country and Western (Yawn).\n\nI ordered a spare ribs appetizer and a caesar salad. The salad was good. The ribs were great. They were fall-off-the-bone tender and had a wonderful sauce that was just perfect. Dollops of bleu cheese on the ribs was a surprisingly good complement to the succulent meat. The portion was entree sized too.  My boss was ecstatic about his dish as well.\n\nAfter the meal, we talked to the manager and asked him why more people weren't here. He said that they do incredible business at night. I also commented that he might want to lose the country music. \n\nI returned for dinner a few weeks later.  I ordered the ribs again, with grilled corn on the cob.  The ribs were again enjoyable, but the recipe seemed a bit different with more chipotle spice added.  The corn was very tender and tasty.\n\nMy very attractive server was also the daughter of the owner.  She told me they have only been in  business for 6 months or so.  It also seemed that they changed the music to a more modern, eclectic vibe.",3
"I had some time to kill and stopped in here on an impulse to try a gel manicure. I've done gel manicures myself at home and love how they last at least two weeks. Since I was treating myself and having them done, I figured I'd go for the french manicure since I'm not that coordinated to do that for myself. \n\nI was the only customer in there, until a woman stopped in to have a nail repaired. Having nothing else to do, the rest of the staff sat around and talked and listened to their ipods and played with their phones. The place wasn't very clean and a fine layer of nail dust seemed to coat everything at my nail techs station. \n\nShe shaped my nails kind of square-ish, which is not really my preference, but they look pretty good. You have to \""cure\"" the polish under the UV light for each layer in order to set it. This just takes a minute or two but my nail tech proceeded to use her phone during this time. I find this annoying.  I paid $35 plus tip for the french gel manicure, and they charge $30 for a regular gel manicure. \n\nMy disappointment as I look at my nails one day later, is that there is a chip already. Gel nails aren't supposed to chip and they are supposed to last at least two weeks and just sort of grow out as your nails grow. So what's the deal? I guess I'm better off doing them by myself at home.",0
The service is good. Like the pad Thai with ground chicken and veggie& tofu red curry. Prefer 4-star spicy.,3
"I love hearing people hate on the Vet. Every native of Phoenix knows the history of the Vet, its importance to the town, and so on. Just a few decades back, it was the liveliest stadium in the NBA, and housed the first true sports team in the valley, Phoenix Roadrunners Hockey. Now a hulk of its former self, its depressing, yes. \n\nThe Vet gets 3 stars for three seperate reasons:\n\n1-History: Like I mentioned, this place has a lot of Phoenix history packed in it. It was THE stadium you would go to for an event. Hockey games, when played here, were very fun, boisterous, and there were very few parking issues. Every Suns fan knows this place as \""The Madhouse on McDowell\"", and for good reason...it could get extremely loud. The seats are old-school, you can see the 70's style billboards still up there, and of course they have all of the old Roadrunners info up in the rafters...the place has history, a strong history, that can't be denied. Connie Hawkins, KJ, Dan Majerele, Dick Van Arsdale....list goes on, all of them played here. Just remember that when bashing the place.\n\n2- Parking: For a small stadium, they do have a ton of parking in the lot. It may not seem like a lot when the fair is in town, but when a general event is taking place, they have more than enough room to accomodate space. The original planners did a good job with that, at least.\n\n3-Architechture: Like I said, this place is a blast from the past. Everything is old-school. Who DOESN'T like old-school? I love the chairs, once again...I used to sit in those same chairs decades ago when the stadium was still in use, the Dbacks were just a dream, the Suns were at the Purple Palace (aka AWA) for a couple years now....its old, lol. The outside has aged a ton because of the Sun's rays, but the old retro stylings on the outside are funky-cool.\n\nIt loses a couple stars for just the same reasons as mentioned above. Its old...probably should be replaced because it needs repairs (despite what others have said) if you want to make it a multi-use stadium again. It has very few redeeming factors to out-of-towners or kids these days, they really do not dig history much, bank on that. To many, its just a big hulk that \""smells bad\"".\n\nI love this stadium. Sooner rather than later it'll get torn down, and a part of me will die. Oh well, life goes on. Go Runners'!",2
"Horrible customer service! The cashier that just opened her register didn't take the next person in line, she took the person at the end of the line? What's really going in with that?",0
"Very rude cashier named Angela, I believe. Dark hair, glasses, sour face. My daughter, an ASU, student was short-changed $15. Angela  kept giving us the run-around about getting our money back.  In the end, we never did. So we stopped going to this QT.  That's a shame because we were going here twice a day on our way to and from ASU. We still love QT--just not the girl at this location. Hopefully she's gone by now..",0
"Somehow we had this company come to our house even though we live in the Bay Area, California. The contractor called us from a 707 area code, so I know I have the right company. They've been out to our house TWICE and our refrigerator has not been fixed, even though we have paid them.\n\nHowever, today, we had a dumb *** contractor come to our house to look at our refrigerator. This contractor really should go back to school or something, cause he doesn't know what he is talking about. When my mother basically told him his idea of 'defrosting' a frost free refrigerator (keeping the door open and unplug it for 12 hours- uhhh plus, we'd lose a lot of food if we did that!), he lost his cool and starting being rude.\n\nI would really not deal with this company even if its the last applicance company on earth. The contractors are unprofessional and wasted our time, because my mom had to take a day off work for this.",0
I absolutely love this place! Since the minute you walk in it is so cute and different. They great you with an edible menu and you choose your main dessert for your 3 course deal. It is very small so it makes it more exclusive. They only serve dessert so if you are looking for food you are at the wrong place :),3
"fresh.. & pretty fairly priced.  not the best sushi i've had.\n\nnothing special with the miso.  [of all things to look for something special i had to say the miso right?]\n\n- tempura calamari for an appetizer..\ndope. calamari is super tender.  it came with about 6 pieces [french toast sticks size]\n\nthen we tried a deep fried assorted stuffed with assorted fish sushi that came in 2, 6.. etc. it was decent.  a lot going on.   I don't remember the name but the sushi is shaped as a fish. :) I thought that was interesting.\n\n- tuna poke salad!\nwasn't the best I've ever had. \nbut still yummy!    \n \n-I had a rainbow roll\n-husband had an eel roll & a chicken terriyaki bowl \n\n and at the end of all that.  plates were empty and we were super satisfied. \n\nexcellente.",2
"For the price, it is not a bad place to stay. It is on the north end of the Strip, so a bit far from the other hotels and casinos. However, the rooms are clean, large and reasonably priced. The restaurants are also quite good. One of the bars has a $19.95 (from 4:00 - 8:00 PM) 'all you can drink' (draft beer, martini and margaritas only) happy hour special.",2
"Although they had some lovely starters, I wasn't blown away by the meal. It was very standard Thai food, which is what you can expect for the most part. But the prices were substantial, myself and my 5 year old son somehow managed a bill over \u00a330. \n\nI went here of a very quiet Saturday early evening, I think they had just opened for tea time. It was absolutely dead, I think there was myself and another couple in the entire restaurant. \nThe service was very considerate and attentive I couldn't fault them for that. Although with only 2 tables filled how else could they be.\nThe food was definitely fresh and plentiful. Although in comparison to some other Thai places I have been to in the city, not a scratch on them.\n\nOverall, it was just OK",2
"Since Greens and Proteins opened, the gf and i eat here at least once every other week.  It's one of several dining options within walking distance of LVAC and it's definitely our fav especially when we are faking it trying to eat nutritiously.  About the only thing we haven't tried are the various smoothies, shakes, veggie blends, etc.\n\nOur fav item on the menu is the make your own meal - a protein, a veggie and a starch with a sauce.  The cost ranges from $9 to about $18.  I generally go for the pork loin or turkey ( the cheaper selections ) with the veggie choice of either mushroom, asparagus or spinach and the brown rice with the pesto sauce.  they have about 8 choices in each category.\n\n\nAlso like the tofu fries, the chicken fingers and the caesar salad.  The pizzas are also decent but suggest you ask them to make the crust crisp since at times i felt the crust was \"" limp\""\n\nGood service and they have a several flat screen TV's for sports watching.",3
My first taste of chick fil a in YEARS. It was going great until they forgot the mayo.,2
"From the outside it doesn't look like much and the decor consists of rejects from my grandma's garage, but once you bite into their special pesto-mayo, bacon, tomato & onion hot dog, you'll be singing their praises.\n\nThis little shop is run by some very friendly people who put together some deliciously unique \""fast\"" food.  The menu is simple - hot dogs, tacos, and burgers. However, don't be fooled into thinking the food itself is simple.  The tacos are overflowing in both flavor and portion (3 tacos for $5) - I think the chicken is the best.  The hotdogs come on homemade buns and the dogs themselves have a wonderful \""snap\"" when you bite into them. And your meal just isn't complete without one of their exotic icy lemonades -- I'd highly recommend the dessert pear.\n\nSince my first visit only a month ago, I've been back several times and plan to keep going back.  Now I just have to try their breakfast menu.",4
"This is a whole lot of dungeon than fun.  I used to love this underground playland when it was still Fantasy Faire with the Little John's Snack Bar and gift shop, but now, it's just dumb. Yes, it's just dumb. \n\nThere's no real excitement here anymore, I surveyed the games and about 67% of them were down (turned off, broken, not manned) at only 8:23PM! (Supposedly, they're open till 10PM on Friday nights...) Games are more expensive now too, about $1-$2 per game, and the stuffed toys aren't the cutest either, they do have Despicable Me Minions and Hello Kitty, but the rest are Made in China-UHHHGLYY.  I'm just not happy with this place, upstairs in the gaming floor isn't that great either.  By the way, they took out the gift shop, Milk Jug Toss game, Basketball, and Witches' Cauldrons.  At this rate, they'll probably go without prize-winning games in the near future, just saying.\n\nI suppose, certain hyperactive kids will enjoy this place especially if they don't know any better than spending their parents' money.  This place does get stuffy, I don't know why they won't upgrade their ventilation system instead of adding the stupid Dairy Queen/Orange Julius booth.  But, if you do need a breather, the men and women's restroom is roomy, bright, and very well ventilated.  \n\nEmployees here are an absolute drag, it'll be a miracle to actually get an attendant's attention when a coin-game has no tickets without leaving your child there to stand guard at the machine.  There used to be happy-go-lucky employees at every game but now they've been replaced by emotionless beings, well okay, there's maybe a couple pleasant beings in the area. \n\nOkay, so, this place isn't all horrible, they have one of the MOST GLORIOUS TICKET REDEMPTION CENTERS of all.  They have everything from licensed material Monopoly to mini TVs to Barbie Dolls and sports blankets, a lot of their prizes are pretty cool and not much of that lame-o plastic knickknacks.  \n\n2 stars because it went from quality fun to wallet-emptying \""fun\"" and for doing unnecessary changes to my once, favorite arcade.  Honestly, just go to Circus Circus Midway Acts for any arcade fun, they still have a majority of the prize-winning games, it is more stuffy and smokey, but it is more fun!  Go to the Fun Dungeon to have the fun sucked out of you for more.",1
"Me and my husband ate here for the 1st time. It was lunch time and we were hungry.  I think this resaurant used to be a diner because it has a diner feel to it but they redecorated it well. We were seated in a booth and it was comfy. We had chips, salsa and bean dip and they refilled it when we were out. Yay! I had the chicken flautas and it came with beans and rice. What is really nice about this menu is that most of the dishes come with guacamole and sour cream. Not many restaurants just give that out. The food was so good, I can't wait to come back.\n\nThe restaurant is very clean. There is a bar inside with no gambling.\nThis is located in the Albertson's lot on buffalo at vegas.",3
"My hubby works at Town Square and walked by this place-he brought home what he clued \""the best $28 tea you'll ever have\"". I said \""it damn well better be!\""\n\nWell, I walked by this place the other day waiting for him to get off work, and was immediately please at the hot tea sample stand,with two varieties, right outside the door!\nI had both and they were AMAZING.\nSO now I always drink the one he brought home,its incredible. It always seems to be on sample there. \""white ayervedic\"" something with \""samurai\"" something lol I'm awful with names!\nYes it is pricey, yes there are MORE samples to try inside!, and no there isn't a tasting room or a place to order and drink :( but you won't be disappointed if you appreciate a good tea.\nPS: If you buy, you will get a nifty purple,metal canister with your tea leaves inside. They smell amazing.",3
"The best burgers in Edinburgh. Check.\n\nBlink and you miss Bells, it's small intimate and quaint but oh does it deliver a mighty burger!\n\nYou'll find a variety of choices ranging from good ol classics like cheese and bacon to more exotic Roquefort and mushroom. There are also a few different meat sizes so even the biggest of appetite is catered for.\n\nFor me a burger is all about the bun and the meat, the bun should be soft, sesame topped and lightly toasted. The meat should be flavourful, slightly spicy and cooked medium to well. Not too much pink, and hold the leather. Perfect!\n\nNow I love a sauce with my burger, the more the merrier, and its a good job you get a tray of 8 varieties of sauces, to douse your burger to your hearts content. I go for a different sauce with almost every bite. Weird I know, but you don't want to miss out now, do you?\n\nI'm not a fan of milkshakes but there's a good range offered including beers and the usual soda drinks.\n\nNow I mentioned that it was small, which means you're almost never going to get a table on a weekend without booking, so do yourself a favour and pick up the phone and book.\n\nBecause of it's size and the constant stream of people looking for a table, for me, it's not a place where you can hang around to socialise after your meal so for that reason 1 star down.\n\nThe best burger in Edinburgh is a controversial subject, I know, but I'm happy to play Bells as the ace up my sleeve.",3
"I live 10 minutes away from Limon so when my sister called me and asked where I wanted to go for my birthday, I figured it might be nice to hit Limon and enjoy a nice Mexican meal on the terasse. I have to say the night started off on a bad note when we were told that they didn't have a table for us on the terasse even if we had made our reservation the week before and were assured a table on the terasse. The hostess gave us an attitude as if it was our fault they had given our table away. We were seated at the noisiest table in the place right next to the bar where the owner seemed to be hosting a party for his friends. This made it hard to hold a conversation with anyone other then the person sitting next to you.\n\nThe hostess seated us but forgot to give us menus and the wine list, so when our waitress finally see if we wanted something to drink and we asked for menus and a wine list she turned walked away mumbling something that sounded like insults and didn't come back around for another 10 minutes. We finally ordered drinks and some appetizers which came quickly because they were delivered to our table by the busboy. Our waitress spend the entire night at another table drinking wine and doing shots, thank god for the busboy. If it wasn't for him I fear we would have never received our meals. \n\nWhen we finally got our food we all agreed that it had about as much in common with authentic Mexican food as the taco kit from old Elpasso.\nmy meal was bland, the presentation looked thrown together and it was served cold. Suffice it to say I was unimpressed with my meal.\n\nThe decor of the place is interesting, they had framed images of various Mexican themed pictures that made us chuckle, the tables had good separation between them and were pretty comfortable.\n\nAll and all our experience at Limon was disappointing. Bad service and bland food makes that I won't be back anytime soon.",1
"Three words, Thai Yoga Massage. Wonderful experience. Staff was friendly and courteous and the locale itself is just lovely.  Four stars not five is because I was expecting a different sort of  Thai yoga massage. =p Nevertheless it was a fantastic experience.",3
"This place is stellar Mexican food.  So far I have yet to find a great Mexican spot, but this might be it.  I have had several dishes off of the menu which were all tasty.  \n\n     However the garlic shrimp was bomb, I love the beans here also.  I had the fried chicken I forgot the name, it was good however if it came with sauce it would be better so I added there chipotle cream which made it right.  Taquitos and imperial shrimp apps are delicious.  You have to order the lemonade agua fresco, so bomb I had about 5 glasses.  I'm not a big Sangria drinker but even that was tasty. Desert the churros are so good, they come with a little cream filling and a banana foster sauce to dip them in.  Flan has a cheesecake like consistency which I like, because I don't care for traditional Flan and the eggy taste.  I will definitely go back. So many good dishes and Chef Paco can custom make dishes to your taste. \n\n     Some dishes are $25 and I think they could be a little cheaper however on average dishes are $10-$17. Its good for groups and even coming in by yourself has a nice open layout and friendly staff.  If you come to Vegas for Mexican food near the strip or just good flavors, try it.",3
Went for my second time and I was not impressed.  Food was ok.  Too pricey.  The atmosphere is great.  I just wish the food was as well.  I won't be back anytime soon.,1
"Ended up staying at the Stratosphere, and at first glance these jumpers looked quite insane. When you're on the ground, the jump platform looks like a tiny rectangle ridiculously high up in the air. The people are barely visible when they first jump. \n\nAfter watching them both outside and on the TV all weekend, I figured what the hell, what's a 855 foot jump off the 108th floor, right? So I went and paid my fee and suited up. Everyone was very professional through the whole process and my harness was checked several times by multiple different people. Really the scariest part of the whole thing I think is waiting up at the top, in line to enter the glass fishbowl room that is connected to the jump platform. A number of the people at the bar are asking if you're scared while others are just kind of shaking their heads as if to say \""yikes\"".\n\nLike the other reviews already said, they walk you to the edge and make you put your toes over the ledge and grab the rails after they hook you up. You really notice the hot wind blowing around standing there (for what feels like an eternity). I was then asked to lean forward a bit which was easy because the line you are connected to has some tension on it pulling you out (the staff will help hold you in place). This is followed by a super-fast 321 countdown and they let go, and then you let go.\n\nA split second after you release, there is a \""oh sh*t, what did I just do\"" moment. Not that it matters because you're pretty much committed at that point. After that initial moment, its smooth sailing all the way down, and over way too fast. The touchdown pad is very soft and springy.\n\nI did a 1am jump, and the skyline with the hot summer breeze was really nice. Next time I may try it during the day. I would say overall I am not terrified of heights but Im not really excited about them either. It's much easier if you don't look down when you are on the platform, just look at the strip and when they count down don't think, just do.\n\nIf you're from out of town think of it this way - when the hell are you ever going to have a chance to do something like this again? You get a really nice adrenaline rush and its very exciting, especially if you have never done something like this before. \n\nWould I recommend this to others: absolutely!\nWould I do this ride again: You bet!\nWill I buy any extras besides the jump next time: naw",4
"Walking into Dish provided me with a sense of comfort since I come from a deep Southern background.  The menu was rich in choices that I would expect of a place like this.\n\nThe food was average if not a bit above average, however the waiter we had was unattentive and slow.\n\nI will return and try this diner again to see if possibly a different experience with the waiter/waitress will enhance the mood.  However, if I receive the same service, I will definitely reccomend other places instead of Dish because what you will find here is nothing extraordinary.",2
Great location in the Aria casino for people watching. We came here to watch the Kentucky football game which they were kind enough to change on one of the TVs. My husband and I started off with bud and I got the Blue Moon. After a while it looked like the waitress got a a little busy since she was the only one working the floor so we moved on to buckets. They are a great deal. $25 for 5 but the selection is limited. They only had Heineken or dos equis so we opted for the former. They gave us some corn nuts and snack mix whisk was a nice touch! Might have to come back here later to try their cocktails as a night cap ;),3
"Stayed here over the weekend and it was fantastic! The pool is fun, the rooms are cute, and the best part is there are NO KIDS! So if you want to have fun without kids around this is the place.",4
"We ordered take out tonight for the Yankee game. 3 Egg rolls , 2 orders of dumplings in peanut sauce, and 2 orders of general Tao chicken. The order arrived in 20 minutes and it was still hot. The dumplings were good. the sauce was fine. But that's the only positive note I can make, for a 58.00 order plus 20 percent for the delivery man. \n\nThe egg rolls were overlooked - in oil that was long gone. Dark brown, hardened to black edges. The chicken was no better. Nearly blackened on the outside, and yet without the sweet crunchy flavor we all expect of the ever popular General Tao. Soft and oily, slightly bitter, with none of that simple sweet comfort food General Tao flavour. \n\nMy young teens were as unimpressed as I. This is the first time I've seen these two carnivores leave Chinese fried chicken on their plates. But It was a good night for Leo the dog!\n\nI called he restaurant and let them know we were disappointed. There was no offer of any recompense, and only a rather insincere apology. Even after I said It was the last meal we would order from the restaurant.\n\nI would never order out again, it's too difficult to send the plate back to the kitchen. A visit to the restaurant is a safer bet. But I wouldn't bother with that either. Yelp requires at least 1 star. but I'd like to  give them a negative 5 stars!",0
"Worst service i have ever experienced. Not even worth one star!! We went because of the groupon - not worth it. We waited over an hour for our food, the order was wrong, never refilled our drinks. We complained to the manager who rolled his eyes then asked to speak to us outside.... Like we were in trouble. Will never be going back!!",0
"Perkins is akin to Denny's or IHOP in my eyes and has food that is consistently lousy. That said, it's quite cheap and there are free refills on coffee and soda. I would say the pie is decent, at best.",1
"Great classic breakfasts, nothing fancy but very fresh and very good. I'm coming back!",3

"This is not the easiest review I've had to write. I want so bad to love this place and it has several lovable qualities. But it also has several dis-likable and even hate-able  qualities.\n\nThe decor is super nice. Naulins' in Charlotte for sure. Not overly busy like an Applebee's or similar, but lots of interesting stuff to look at. The hostess was nice and got us to a table quickly which we appreciated. Our server was smiley and pretty attentive but almost blase' about service. \nThe food is where we start really running into problems. We hit that joint on a hungry Sunday morn. We ordered drinks and my dad even mentioned how the menu pics really did a great job of selling the dishes. At our table we ordered a couple of plates of Choc Chip pancakes (fer the youngens), a Crab-cake Benedict, a Florentine Benedict, a 2 egg and bacon plate and the New Orleans omelet (Pork-apalloza would be a fair name as it had bacon, ham, sausage and andoille in it) I also ordered chipotle sauce to slather my porky beast with. \n\nMy wife enjoyed the crabcake dish but the size was somewhat underwhelming. My sis-in-law loved the Florentine with the fresh spinach and hollandaisse, the eggs and bacon was reasonable and my omelet was tasty. The pancake review from my 11 year old was less than stellar when he said that Bob Evens pancakes were better.\n\nHere's the not so good stuff. \n\nMy wife's plate came with green leaf lettuce as a garnish, unfortunately the lettuce was nasty! Brown and slimy at the tip. Really unappealing. Was not caught by the cook who put it there, the expediter or the waitress and food runners that helped. It really was nasty.\n\nThough its a nice touch that some of the meals come with what I believe is a house-made muffin, they are really not that great. The Chocolate Mousse muffin was passable but not memorable except in it's passable-ness.  As I've mentioned before in another review, if you make something a flagship item, then that mother better be AWESOME, not passable. \n\nAs aforementioned, the server was a little blase' about service. I asked for a cup of ice to thin down my very good but thick orange juice which took way too long to receive. My dad asked for extra butter with his toast (they served 2 slices of toast with one butter pat) which first, took a while and then they gave him 4. Underkill and then overkill. Then at finishing time it took a several minutes to get the check and then I got to watch her do way to many things rather than pay out the check and get me my change. I can dig it when I server does their job in a seemingly calm and together manner, but when they can do it in that manner and get stuff done quickly it's magical. No magic this Sunday.  \n\nHere's the hate-able:\nBoxed frozen taters! REALLY! And not nearly enough even if they were good. My wife and I were blown away by the quality of the potato's (Not really a hash brown but rather a cubed potato thing lightly seasoned with an orange colored seasoning.) No self respecting breakfast joint should ever consider this as an option.\n\nSo, not great, but also not awful. Too much Meh to give it a 4 star but not enough Meh to give it 2. I won't go out of my way to get there but will not turn down a free meal there. \n\nEat well my friends!\nV-Dub",2
"Grabbed a coffee and a new book. 10% discount for B&N members. Not necessarily the best coffee (I mean it's Starbucks - what can you really expect?) nor the best book prices (c'mon it's not an online retailer), but it's a tranquil spot to pass some time and catch up on some reading.",2

Vegas 5 Days 3 Nights at steakhouses and unfortunately they were all this trip from OK to downright awful.  Our last night was going to see a show at the MGM and we decided for simplicity sake to eat there at one of their many restaurants.  Craftsteak was the selection. \n\n5 of us arrive and its a handsomely appointed modern vibe type steakhouse that certainly has the ambiance downpat. We had requested a table not a both and there are no tables available in the main dining room so they stick us in an ANNEX room that appeared to be part of the private dining area. Just us 5 here took away from the incredible ambiance of the place. MAJOR STRIKE 1.\n\nWine list presented and 150% to 200% mark up on the wine but the sommelier was very good and we ended up with a not over the top price wise cambernet that was excellent.  Hot Buns more like whitel castle hamburger buns were served as we perused the menu that aparently changes daily.  Heavy meat selections almost no fish  with very high price points particularly to the point only 2 of their cuts were prime meat so you are talking overkill for a step down in grade. \n\nA Beets Salad to start was fresh and tasty but really had nothing to offer that made itspecial $15.00\n\nRoasted red peppers with garlic chips.. Not quite sure what that ment but they were out of jar red peppers with no taste and some sliced garlic and olive oil $15.00 (FAIL)\n\n2 Shrimp Cocktails 5 to order 12 to a pound size shrimp $24.00 each... Umm HELLO over priced so I could not get past the price points for the ok Shrimp. \n\n1 Ceasar Salad $15.00 Nothing Special at all \n\n\nDinner:\n2 bone in Prime Rib Eyes were OK and their steak knives were awful ... Their 3 Bone IN NY STRIPS were also OK but with prices points of 69.00 each they are Completely out of their Minds.  All and all Price was Steaks Fail.  Sides were Asparagus dry and tasteless\nFrench Fries Good\nRissoto excellent and baby shitake mushrooms sauteed tasteless  ...5 Coffees hot and fresh... \nSo 5 Persons 2 bottles of wine with the above order and with tip $1025.00 Sorry folks I don't mind paying for top shelf but from the seating to the really fail food I can't go over two stars here. PASS better options around.,1
"Always consistant, and this locale is perfect for a quick save u a bunch o cash if ur going to a shoreline show. I cant.tell you how peeps look at you with those \""wanting eyes\"" when u whip out a double double animal style with frys. Especially when they are prolly just as hungry as u with only $10+ options that they also have to leave their seat to get, those crowd hawkers dont bring burgers or real food around now do they?",3
"Service is great, the food is just OK but the prices is steep for the portions. Good variety of filipino food. Plus is the bakeshop.",2
"I went to Society late in the evening on it's first day open.. technically going on on the second day.. but they are open very late so that is that. \n\nFirst off.. hilarious is the review of  \""hard to please\"" I saw the review the first day that I went to write this, and it slightly annoyed me that someone would rather complain about toast that is over-done, rather than ask for new toast.. not that big a deal. Then, (lol) to post a photo of the 'toast scrapings\""... classic. Seriously? I waited to read other reviews as I was in a hurry to get some late night action in :)\n\nAnyway, I had a great time. 4 stars instead of 5 because it was the first day, the server was trying hard to please us as she was swamped and the cute busser from France ended up helping us out more throughout the meal. (Even taking an order when needed) To me this says a bit more about the service.. again, the minus 1 star because they had kinks to work out, and I am sure they will. It's a new joint.. but  I will definitely go again. \n\nFood was quality, I had short ribs (hard to mess up) .. and the warmed pretzel bread with grain mustard butter was a nice touch while we waited for food. The price is about $50 per guest.. that was with 1appetizer, 1 cocktail each.. and 1 entree each.. no dessert.. We were too full. Portion sizes are great, and the setting is modern and comfortable. \n\nAnyway, if you are @ Encore and need a late-night meal.. check it out. \n\nOn a side note SWITCH Steakhouse looks awesome, and if you can't join them in the dining room, sit at the bar just outside and watch the scene and color of the dining room change every so often.. then go eat there! Happy eating!",3
"Jodie is a true professional. She is fun and outgoing and made the wedding announcement energetic. She knew exactly what type of music would get the crowd going. What's even more impressive was the help she provided to us before the wedding - timing and feedback on the schedule of events and even how to toast - since my fianc\u00e9 and I had never done that before. Even though the reception was running late due to limo problems, she was right there to keep everything going. I highly recommend her to every bride out there! You will not be disappointed!",4
"I don't understand all the five-star reviews for a statue of a dog and a maudlin tale on the plaque.  Five stars means \""as good as it gets.\""  \n\nEdinburgh is great and it is much better than this statue of a dog.   A very cute statue of a very cute dog.\n\nIf you're traveling with kids, read them the story the night before and take them to the statue.  But then go on to The Elephant House (apparently a pilgrimage site for Harry Potter fans) for lunch.  \n\nIf you don't have children with you, stop for a minute or two, take a few pix, and then cross the street to  the National Museum.  The National Museum is in fact as good as it gets.",1
"Old hotel, not a real fan of it.  But, they do have Wolfgang Puck Grill & Bar inside, which has rather reasonable pricing!",1
"We were looking forward to trying this neighborhood restaurant since we heard good reviews about its Mesa location.\n\nWe were incredibly disappointed.\n\nThere were 4 hostesses at the front desk, none of whom could care less about actually greeting us.  We felt as if it we were an imposition to take our name.\n\nAfter waiting for our table, we were seated about 20 minutes later.  The service just went downhill from there.  The waitress, Angela, was slow, inexperienced, and not particularly knowledgeable about the wine list.  She even kept apologizing for the poor service and acknowledging her responsibility for it.\n\nWhile I have to say, the food was very good, we will not be back because the service was so poor.",0
"Quite frankly, I'm not sure how the reviews for this place are so good. We went for lunch for Restaurant Week, and it was really pretty meh.\n\nStarted with the smoked salmon on crostini--definitely the highlight of the meal. The smoked salmon was done in-house and seasoned well. Really good. The greens that came with it, though, were oily and overdressed. Points off.\n\nFor the entree, all three of us got the short ribs--they were really, really mediocre. I mean...just not that good. The pieces were overly fatty (so much so that there wasn't much meat on them), there was a bizarre, hoisin-like sauce on top and then a random piece of parsley (maybe cilantro?). Honestly, the dish came across as confused. The mixed rice told me they were going for Asian inspiration, but the flavors just didn't really work. What meat was actually on the short ribs was good, but didn't stand out.\n\nDessert was profiteroles--the ice cream was absolutely delicious, but let's be realistic--everything that comes from Babcock Hall is delicious. Profiteroles were good, but nothing special. Whipped cream wasn't as thick as it should've been, and was really falling apart.\n\nI debated giving them 2 stars, but the salmon was truly great, as was the service. As for whether I'd go back? No. Restaurant Week is an opportunity for a place to show off how good it is, so I'm willing to go back when it's not RW. Veranda certainly didn't do that.",2

This place is awesome! There bacon jam is heaven in your mouth. The sliders and macaroni are awesome. If you are in Las Vegas this is a must. This place a a great retro look to it. Most people that come here wear button up shirt with jeans. I would highly recommend this place.,4
They have the most unhappy employees that I have ever seen in my life. The restaurant was filthy and I couldn't find a clean table to sit at. After asking a cashier to clean one nobody came over so I cleaned one myself with a napkin. Meanwhile I noticed 5 employees sitting down chatting in the restaurant and watching me clean the table. Management needs to make their employees have pride in their job because everyone is miserable. Worst customer service I have ever experienced. I can see I'm not the first one to have felt that way.,0
"Unfortunately this is another bad review for both Fosters pool service and Old Republic home warranty.  My biggest issue with Fosters is that they do not answer calls or return voice mails... over the period of 2 weeks I left countless voice mails trying to get them to come fix the problem they diagnosed, they never returned one call.  I had to have another pool company come out and and take care of the problem.  As it turns out, Fosters misdiagnosed the problem and the other pool company that came out fixed everything and was much better.  \n\nOld Republic home protection/warranty is a completely different level of bad service and I will be leaving reviews on them as well.  If anyone tries to send Fosters out, dont let them because it is a waste of time.",0
"Love the teriyaki, how it's not too fatty, and the sauce is amazing!

Will definitely be back when I'm craving quick Japanese!",3

"Ok, let me tell you about this place. FYI: I am a real customer, not a family member. So be warned, this is a real review.\n\nThe only thing truly Persian here is the attitude.\n\nI wish this was a friendlier place. The food is ok. Not bad, not great. Has a clean Plebeian atmosphere.\n\nThe food is overpriced and they wont give you half rice and half salad with your meal, a standard in Los Angeles. No, you must eat 3 pounds of rice with your meal.\n\nThey are also super slow. If there is a line, you will wait!\n\nThe Kabob is a little undercooked. No caramelized meat here.\n\nThe staff does not know a lick of Farsi. So dont ask for ghormeh sabzi.\n\nThey dont have  most home made Persian dishes. \n\nWhy cant they open up an authentic Persian restaurant here?\n\nOne more thing, they give you a pat of butter for your rice with the to-go dinner. However, they put it in the same box so if you have to go more then 100 feet before you eat, its melted all over your food. And the close very early.",1
"Nellie had a miserable day today, she really showed her age today and why she was still working cutting hair as she approaches 70. First, she takes a phone call ( a personal phone call from her daughter) during the haircut. She tell me her daughter wants her to do her a favor, then she rushes through the haircut, flubbing some major areas. The area around the ears was left hairy, she kept forgetting how to turn and keep the electric buzzer operating and she was finished in ten minutes. I would expect more for 13 bucks, so unless they have another $6.99 sale, it is adios to Nellie and those in-haircut phone calls.",0
"Not very impressed. It was a half hour to closing time, so maybe they just slapped mine together or something, but I got these duck rolls and they were just.....kinda fatty/greasy and they had a strange smell to them. Then I also got pad thai with salmon and the salmon was overcooked and hard....ugh no good. The pad thai, itself, was pretty good, but not $13.95 good. I spent $30 just on myself there and it TOTALLY wasn't worth it. Save yo money!",1

"Sooo...I ended up here last Fri. night at around 10:30 after a total customer service fail at another bar downtown that shall remain unnamed (see my bad customer service list if you must know...)  My friend and I had just finished crawling the art galleries downtown, and were in the mood for some libations and grub.\n\nWe started off with some drinks.  Upon opening the drink menu, I was struck by its length and breadth.  I was initially tempted by the lavender-lemon concoction, but ultimately decided to go with a white Russian, since I'd never had one before and my lab manager had talked them up, and I enjoy my drinks sweeter as the night goes on.  It was a nice little drink--very smooth and strong, and I enjoyed the blending of the vanilla and coffee liqueur.  The best part, however, was the graham cracker crumbs on the rim!  My friend went with the painkiller, a favorite of his.  I had a sip, and it was also quite good, even though it involved coconut and I'm not usually much of a fan of coconut flavor.  Later on, he also ordered a beer (forget which kind) and a shot of yellow cake (he explained that this is a tradition because [insert backstory involving hung-over friends here]), whereas the white Russian was sufficient to quench my alcoholic thirst for the evening (I'm a lightweight when it comes to drinking).\n\nIn terms of food, we ordered the large plain macaroni and cheese.  (He doesn't eat much seafood, and I don't eat beef, which precluded all of the other options.)  Given that I'm a mac and cheese connoisseur, and that another friend recommended the mac here, I was excited to try it.  When it came out, it looked quite attractive, with interesting noodles and a sprinkling of bread crumbs on top (I'm a fan of bread crumbs on my mac).  While the flavor of the cheese was pleasant, the cheese:noodle ratio was way too low, to the point that I ended up scraping the plate to get enough of it to cover my noodles. This should never happen with a quality mac and cheese!  Even my friend, who'd had the side dish mac and cheese before, said he thought the cheese was lacking in quantity.\n\nBecause there wasn't any seating available on the patio, we were seated inside the door to the left, against the wall between the hallway and the bar.  The lighting was pretty dim, which made it a bit hard to see.  The atmosphere was definitely casual, and service was acceptable (though perhaps could have been a bit more attentive).  For the items listed above, we spent $50 + tip, which seems a bit steep.  If I were to return, I'd try to come during happy hour, since they have some nice deals on drinks and food.  3.5 stars.\n\nEDIT: I think the lack of cheesiness in the mac and cheese that I received was a fluke, based on reports from friends and the owner's comment (see below).  I'll have to come back another time to resample it--if I do, I'll update my review accordingly.",2
"Probably the most unpleasant trip i've ever experienced. Flying with this airline out does sitting in economy by the bathroom on a 15 hour flight. A friend and I were on our way back to JFK from Mexico but had a layover at Charlotte. As we went down to claim our baggage, we realized the conveyer belt wasn't working. A worker comes down and I hear her say that it has been broken for about an hour. So i  assumed it was almost fixed. But we stood there for another hour as this tiny old woman was attempting to throw a few bags down from the machine that drops the bags down onto the belt. She eventually gave up. What I didn't understand was why they left the conveyer belt broken for so long, knowing that it was broken and that most of us had a another flight to catch relatively soon. \n\nWhen we went through customs, another lady indifferently warned us that we'll probably miss our flights. So yes, we missed our flights and when we finally claimed our bags, more US airways workers gave us no direction on where to go and just took our bags from us and threw them onto another conveyer belt with no explanation. It was just insanely hectic. The only flight after that 1 pm flight was the 10 pm flight which left us stuck in a city where even the airport workers told us wasn't worth the money to visit. We were completely exhausted, but the added indifference of the airline as well as the incredibly rude and snotty workers did nothing but make me realize that I will never fly with US Airways again.",0
"The service from our waiter was quite good. He is the reason I gave GB more than one star. My wife and I went with my parents after a movie, hoping for a good meal. After spending 70 dollars on four entrees and 20 dollars on drinks, we got out after tax and tip for over 100 dollars. The food was flavorless, expensive, small portions, and boring. It was very disappointing. My dad ordered the lobster crab cakes, which came in a pair, and about two inches in diameter. The price on these were I believe over 20 dollars. I don't think I would go back, maybe just for reverse happy hour. Our server was the highlight of the evening.",1
"This was my second trip here. I waited to review in hopes of a better experience but that didn't happen. Service was excellent as our server was quick to deliverer both food and drinks. I'm just not a fan of the food here. A few of our shrimp appetizer were over done. They put the dark side facing down but it was obvious. The calamari are the long cuts that look like chicken fries and there are not tentacle pieces, just blah on the flavor. We kept it to just appetizers and left, never to return!",1
"DREARY\nDark rooms, chipped paint, peeling laminates, uncomfortable beds... Just pass on this sad hotel.  To enter the \""business center\"" a manager had to use a screwdriver to jimmy the door open revealing a computer 14 years old that wouldn't even print a boarding pass.",0
"People line up at this place like they never had Good Italian.........over rated IMAO!\n\nKeep in mind that good food means little if the service is slow or the order is always wrong. Venizia's does have some tasty food no doubt but the wait time and goofed up orders are unacceptable. \nI was blessed to grow up in a little town off the Pacific coast that had a large Italian community and a Ristorante was never far away, not pasta mills but food that was more like you would get on Sunday at \""Nonna's\"" house.",1

"When I first went into the store to get a product, everyone was so nice and helpful. I got a Mi-Fi for my tablet. I was told there was no contract and I could cancel anytime. I really was not happy with the functioning of the product, so I decided not to keep it. All of a sudden when I came back to return it 3 mos later, I had a 2 yr contract and could not cancel. They told me to call customer service after that and they promised me to cancel, but they did not. After multiple phone calls, lies and stories, I finally wrote the corporate office who took care of it and gave me back a small refund. Would never buy from them again. What a nightmare.",0
"I've been living on the East coast for the last 4 years, and probably hadn't been to a CPK since I was in college....ooof, that's a long time ago!  But I do remember always loving CPK! So since I had some hours to kill while awaiting my flight at McCarran, I thought I'd revisit my roots!  \n\nBoy, was I disappointed!  The service, while friendly, was SUPER SLOW (okay, I understand that there were like 5 tables and only 1 server, but still....the restaurant was pretty emptyyy).  But worse than that, the food was UBER BLAND!!! I ordered the Tequila Chicken Pasta, and it promised lime/jalepeno cream...ugh, it just tasted like nothing. Seriously, like nothing.\n\nAt least the view is nice (floor to ceiling windows overlooking the tarmac).  And there are power outlets along the wall.",1
"Saw Zombie Burlesque opening night. We found  a Groupon that had two tickets for $50 and we definitely paid too much. \n\nThe show is set in a zombie club and run by a zombie host. There are multiple  short skits featuring zombies and 2 humans over two hours. The skits have little-to-nothing to do with each other and there are  some that don't have any real point. There is a Black comedian that makes horrible jokes about Black people throughout his set (he comes on multiple times).\n\nThe Good\nThe aerial artist is very talented (but the song she performs to about girls being stupid was NOT okay). \nThe contortionist was bananas!

"They are trying to be Soho Fusion in the Heart of Dilworth. It doesn't work for me.  When you see fancy places on the travel channel with a few slices of celery and a meal the size of a ritz cracker... Well, that's called high end fusion.  I'd stay away from this place if you're hungry. If you have the urge to eat like Kate Moss or the one Olsen Twin.  This is your spot and its pricey to boot.",1
Tried lunch.  Salad over dressed. Sandwich missing sauce noted on menu. Service very slow given only three tables occupied.  Can't recommend.,0
"I went here a couple of weeks ago as a chaperone for a 3rd grade class.  The same day we were there, there were 2 other schools.  The place was adequately staffed enough to put on a 7 person gunfight.  Most of those volunteers worked elsewhere on the compound (ie the blacksmith and sheriff also did the shootout.)  \n\nThe \""museum\"" is quite large, almost entirely outdoors - so do not plan this on a hot and sunny day.   Most of the buildings w'ere deconstructed and shipped there from other parts of Arizona.  All of the buildings have a decent amount of information posted on/near the front explaining the building's origins, history, and use.  Everything from a farm, to a church, to a school, homes, root cellars, sheriff,  cemetery, bakery (worst exhibit imho,) and the list goes on and on.  However, you can't go inside most of the buildings.  Most are blocked off (to preserve the antique items inside presumably.)\n\nTheir website is awful.  Don't even bother.  \n\nIf you go, as I mentioned, it's all out in the elements.  Beware.  But you can bring your own lunch, which you can enjoy in the town square under one of several giant shade trees.  \n\nMy 8 year old son enjoyed it and would like to go back.  However, as a mother of 4 kids, I know more kids will not enjoy this than will -- but it's a great place to take out-of-towners and history buffs.",3
Weird service here.  Came here for a friend to pick something up.  1 person working the counter and about 8 girls walking the floor.  \n\nAfter waiting in line for a bit I got to the front and asked the counter if they put something away for my friend (she called it in) and they said no.  The girl working the counter was nice enough to call over the speaker to get someone to help me find the item....3 or 4 girls came to the counter to help others who weren't in line.   I waited about 15 minutes until someone came by to get the item.  Not to friendly but they went to check the back room.  They were able to find the item and off I went.  \n\nIf you can get someone to help they're pretty helpful but not to friendly.\n\nI can see why people love this store but the service is still weird!,2
"Ordered the personal pizza.  disappointing. Then dough is cut from a larger, refrigerated ball.  It is then \""massaged\"" into the size needed.  No throwing pizza to size.  Even for the larger pies, I didn't see the usual pizza toss.  Perhaps it's done in the back of the store?  Crust is a bit thicker on the personal pie than the regular NY pie.  Crust is bland and tasteless.  No spongy/crusty olive-oily flavors at all.  Tasted like pre-made cardboard. The base sauce is only average and has a canned, institutional flavor.  I'll give them more time to improve, but if this is the best they can do, the shop isn't going to last very long.",1
"Finally got to try the Food Network renowned Hash House A Go Go.\n\nWe got here at around 8-ish on a Saturday morning; and the wait was already about 30mins.\n\nIt's like... \""c'mon people...aren't you all supposed to be dead tired on your beds from partying last night?\"" --No.. not the case.. apparently.. there are a lot of breakfast enthusiasts that actually do come on breakfast time (They do serve their menu all day...24/7 okay)...\n\nCory and I got seated on a little booth by the bar on the left. Even my tall husband said the table was too high. Let's just say it wasn't too ergonomic for eating.\nOur server's name was: Sassy..... She got our drink orders and Cory and I already knew what our orders were even before being seated.. so we gave that to Sassy too....\n\nWhat i like about Hash house is that... It doesn't have a cellphone network coverage for AT&T!!! And it didn't seem like they had wi-fi either.\n\nSo pretty much all my check-ins and foodie Instagram photos had to wait....\nBut I liked how Cory and I got to spend the whole breakfast date...Phone less... How liberating. I was a bit on edge.. but it was awesome. We played with straw wrappers; we checked each other's noses for boogers... we made faces at each other. Yes.. lots of things you can do while waiting for your order.\n\nAnyway...\n\nMy gigantic SAGE CHICKEN AND BACON WAFFLES walked over to the table (like seriously, it covered Sassy's head while she was walking towards our table).... and man was it seriously massive. My jaw dropped and I instantly gained 5 lbs after it was placed on our table.\nLet's just say that It was a different taste of Chicken and a different taste of Waffle.\nThe chicken is deep fried and breaded but with a hint of herb. It lingered in aroma that at one point; i thought i was eating a grilled chicken breast. Ha! Not.\nThe Bacon Waffle completely took me over the edge.They weren't little bits of bacon okay. There were huge pieces of bacon embedded in that waffle. \nThe plate came with two JUMBO pieces of chicken; and 4 jumbo pieces of waffle. TOTALLY SHAREABLE.\n\nCory got the SAGE CHICKEN BENEDICT.... Oh dear lord.. that hollandaise that covered the whole plate? it looked like it was whisked into butter submission goodness perfection.\nRich.Good.. Yummy.. Fried Chicken yummy.. give it to me. I personally liked his better than mine. \nAnd once again.. TOTALLY SHAREABLE.\n\nHighly Recommend to those seeking comfort food that can compensate bad hangovers.\n\nI gave this 3 stars because I wasn't sure if i liked the taste of the food itself; or if i was just overwhelmed with their extraordinary way of plating. I mean.. my two chickens were atop each other on a stack of waffles secured with a huge steak knife.\nI'd have to give this another shot again and try simpler items on the menu to break down their food artistry and concentrate on their flavors.\n\nBoth our orders plus a little banana Latte was close to $50.00++. So... it could get pricey for two people..",2
"We went back in last night after corresponding a bit with the owner, Jason.  He graciously comped us two entrees so we could see that the staff had been talked with about our experience.  We were very happy that Nicole waited on us.  Have always had good service from her in the past but last night she was better than ever!  And this was without me pulling out the e-mail comping the two entrees until it was time to settle the check.  Normally their dinner special isn't ready till about 6 pm (esp on Monday's when it's prime rib!) but after seeing my reaction she took it upon herself to see if it was ready...now that's a good waitress!  There's only one thing I'd change...some fresh horseradish would've made the meal a 10!  Food was great, service was great and we will definitely be back!",3
"I love Dairy Queen and especially their chicken strips and fries. I get this almost every time I come, and am never disappointed. My one complaint is that every time I do, regardless of I just waited behind other customers in the drive thru, I am asked to drive to the front and wait for my food. Tonight I sat for a good 10 minutes and when I pulled up, I paid and immediately asked to pull to the front. The good thing is I know my food is fresh, but what bothers me is in that 10 minutes I waited behind two customers, my order hadn't even been started? I waited in the parking lot an additional 11 minutes before someone brought me my one order of chicken strips. Hopefully they improve this.",2
"Well, it's official. I am addicted to boba. Easy Life Boba is the third place in town that I have tried, and easily my favorite thus far. \n\nWhat makes Easy Life so great compared to Lollicup and Boba City Cafe? First and foremost the price! I was able to get a large taro tea with boba for under $4, which is about $1 less then the other places I have tried.  Add in the fact that they have a punch card and this is a great deal! \n\nNow, I realize that sometimes a cheaper price means you are sacrificing quality. Not here. This drink was just as good if not better then any other drink I have had with boba. \n\nAnother reason that Easy Life stands out is the service. The girl that helped me was great. I let her know that I was somewhat new to the world of boba, told her what I normally order (honeydew milk tea with boba), and asked for a recommendation on another flavor to try. I have done this before at other locations, but Easy Life is the first place where I have been offered a sample to taste before I ordered. \n\nI was in and out in about 7 minutes. The only thing I would change about Easy Life is the location, and that is just for purely selfish reasons!",3

"We've gone to Rocks Lounge twice to see Franky Perez.  In you haven't heard of Franky Perez, he's this talented, local who has a show here (Saturday night) and at Palms (Sunday night).  My friend took me to the Palms to see him first.  I absolutely loved him!  My husband and I have made a point of going to Rocks Lounge to see him.  There's something missing about this lounge.  I'm pretty sure it's the acoustics.  Everything still sounds good but it doesn't sound as great as at the Palms.  \n\nAs far as everything else goes...no complaints.  Fast drink service, friendly waitresses, average drink prices.  I'm sure we'll make our way back here to see him so long as he continues to perform on Saturday nights.",2
"I decided to read the reviews before I wrote mine....and how I agree with Adam M....(Much to my dismay!  LOL)  I didn't know about this bar before I came here, so I do not know much about the history.  I am just happy to find a place to go that plays Sisters of Mercy, the Smiths, and Ministry.  I now have hope that Scottsdale does have some down-to-earth dive punk bars that deserve its due.\n\nI will say that the drinks suck...that is true.  The service, though, isn't that bad.  I was dressed up in a dress (since I just came from another event where I had to wear a little black dress)....I didn't look \""punk\"" or \""alternative\"" at all...and I was treated with respect.  (Odd enough)  It does help that I actually KNOW the songs that they played there and I am not some 20 year old poser.  But that is another story.\n\nThis place is very reminiscent of my younger days and I am very happy to have found it.  I just wish that Daniel Ash showed up before Midnight....DAMN!!!!",3

"I love Dr. Shealey, she is awesome.  However, the \""referral coordinator\"" Dawn and \""aide\"" Mary are completely rude and condescending.  They do NOT want to help they just want to get you off the phone.  I had and appointment with the Dr. and asked for a referral to bariatrics, because I knew the program required an official referral from my PCP (my patient coordinator had even checked my benefits.  In the mail, Dawn sent me a letterhead stating \""your insurance does not require a referral.\""  I called them explaining that although upfront it does not generally require a referral, for this program, and according to the procedure code, it does.  She became very condescending and told me she'd been doing this 15 years and they \""don't do that\"" (give the referral I needed, even though Dr. Shealey had said it was a good idea and agreed to....) and continued to transfer me back to Mary who was also very rude and just said \""WELL WHAT DO YOU WANT ME TO DO?

"It's a great place with great food!  It is a bit pricey for what you get, but the atmosphere is great for a chain restaurant.  The service is top notch; the bar tenders are very chatty which is always great.  Overall, a great place.  \n\n I'm not a fan of their beer selection though, very average.  I hope they expand their selection to carry more upscale beers like Trappistes Rochfort or Duvvel.",3
This place is decent if you are in the area.  We ate here before a Penguins game and it satisfied our needs.  The appetizer with the tomato chutney and the bread was very delicious.   I recommend this appetizer if you do go there.,2
Super delicious food at a great price!!! \n\nRight now they have a great dinner special with both bulgogi and sushi! \nTheir lunch specials are pretty awesome too.  \n\nThe only reason I wouldn't give this a 5 is that the service tends to be a little slow (though overall not bad).,3
"After hemming and hawing over having a desperately-needed water system installed in my house for the past four years, I'm sooo glad that I didn't go with the super-expensive \""big name\"" company (whose reviews, quite frankly, stank).     Before going with Big Name, decided on a whim one day to call AHW because of stellar Yelp reviews.  My call was promptly answered by none other than one of  the owners of the company, who surprised me by saying that he could swing by my house within the hour for a quick 15 min quote - nothing like the two hour, by appointment, only-if-your-husband-is-also-home kind of thing that I'd grown used to.   The price he quoted was literally 1/3 of the \""big name with the bad reviews\"" company.  Still a significant expense, so I waited another four months before deciding to go ahead with it.  I called on Dec. 30, and they scheduled my install for the next day!   Even honored my original quote when they could have waited until after the first and hit me with a price increase.   Install was a little tricky, as I live in an older house and there's a bit of digging and extra plumbing involved.  However, job was done to perfection within hours by very courteous and professional installers.  My water now feels great and tastes amazing.   Here's the kicker: I had two different issues within the first week (one was truly a non-issue,  and one had to do with my irrigation line being affected by the outdoor digging/plumbing).  In each case, my call for help was received immediately and responded to, literally, within the hour.  Unheard of.   This is old-school service.  You will not regret giving these guys your business.  Great job AHW!!",4
"So I have been here a million times, not literally. They used to have the half off sushi after 8pm, but got rid of that recently. The food quality is good, service  8 out of 10 times is completely terrible during, dinner especially even when it's dead, lunch is usually pretty good. We usually come with friends so we can stand the service while we are waiting, if you come with you significant other only, you will be quite frustrated. Overall, food and service could step it up.",1
"The pizza isn't the best, the crust was the real winner.  I was able to sample both the pepperoni and chicken bruschetta pizzas - I think the pepperoni was the winner.  The chicken bruschetta has almost too many toppings, making it difficult to eat without a knife and fork.  The crust on the pepperoni pizza was light, crisp, and tasted very fresh.",2
"Had lunch at the Brat Haus today. The food was good, but the service was terrible and they were not busy. I had the spicy brat with the sauted rootbeer onions. The fries are fresh and they have a lot of dipping sauces to choose from. This is outdoor patio eating, so I would not come here on a hot day. They do have some outdoor games that kept my kids entertained as it took 30 minutes to whip up 4 brats, fries, a salad and a kids grilled cheese. \n\nThere are a lot of other options out there to choose from that don't take this long.",2
Went here with the family on my birthday for dinner.  We sat outside and enjoyed a variety of food from the menu.  The service was nice.  I'm not sure I will venture back... the food didn't stand out in any way and I didn't consider it that cheap.\n\nWe had-\nCalifornia Roll.... my son ate most of them.\n\nInari... good.  just like grandma makes them except I don't have to pay when she make them.  :)\n\nVegetable spring rolls... good.\n\nGyoza... my girls wanted these and then didn't care for them.\n\nSunomono... good but a super super small portion size.\n\nTeriyaki All White Meat Chicken... husband thought it was fine.\n\nSide salad with special house dressing.... was just okay\n\nVegetable Bowl ... YUCK!  No flavor at all.\n\nDecadent Cheesecake (strawberry)... was brought out free for my birthday.  it was just okay\n\nI tried to order miso soup but they were sold out.,2
"Before it was time for me to leave Wynn, I saw someone eating ice cream which looked so darn good.  I found out it was from Sugar & Ice.  I got the tiramisu ice cream and creme brulee ice cream, both were absolutely delicious but my favorite was the tiramisu ice cream.  I cannot wait until my next visit so that I can get some of that ice cream again.  It really doesn't make any sense for something to taste that good...I am still thinking about it. :-)",3
"Only place on the A gate side of the airport to get a good drink and people watch while eating some tasty Mexican food. Cholula everywhere, that's my favorite side chick. Large tequila selection if you're lookin to booze through you next flight. \n\nAlso, the larger tables beside the bar have outlets to charge your electronics. Necessity for anyone needing juice. Unfortunately no Wifi. Five stars if that were the case.",3
"they have a pepper bar!!!! with jalape\u00f1o slices, pepperchinis, and baby peppers! this alone is totally worth coming here. the service was great, staff were super friendly and asked how the food was and came by to throw away our trash. teriyaki burger was delish and tender and flavorful! their fries weren't greasy and they were plump and crispy. I'd definitely come back",3
They redecorated the place and it has a fresh new vibe! Still recommend Le or Anna for fills. Pedicure girls are all pretty good. New Greek restaurant next door is yummy!,3
"Beautiful restaurant in the middle of downtown. Some good advice from the bar tender on wines, even let me taste some before buying. However, as a wine bar, I wish the menu by-the-glass was a little better. They only had about 20 choices in total between whites and reds. I didn't recognize but a couple on the list and wish there was more to grab my attention. Overall though, not bad. I would go again.",2
"Let me start off by saying that I am the so called \""friend\"" of Dave S. as mentioned in the previous review.  What you are about to hear is the truth and not Dave's liberal propaganda.  First, some facts:\n1.  Dave wasn't even hungry to start with.  He just wanted to go home and pass out.  So he was already in an \""anti\"" mood.\n2.  Out of the kindness of my heart I paid for the weird guy on the rickshaw to pedal us over to the shop.  I also paid for the deep fried mac and cheese and we split it.  (Typical liberal, free loading off others.)\n3.  I never said the cheese steaks tasted good.  I only hyped up the deep fried mac and cheese.\n4.  Dave doesn't even know if they really offer peppers or not.  HE DIDN'T EVEN ASK FOR ANY.  Maybe they don't offer them but Dave was too busy being an angry liberal that he didn't even think to ask.  I got an idea...when the lady taking your order asks you what you want on your sandwich....you should tell her!! \n\nThe live DJ in the shop and the party atmosphere at 2 am is a can't miss.  I even meet some fat ugly girl there that just sat down, didn't say anything and started eating the scraps off my plate.  Where else can you get that kind of entertainment?  However, we both did agree that the deep fried mac and cheese was great.  As for Dave's claim about the stale bread and dry meat, it tastes great to me.  As I was busy enjoying my great meal, Dave was trying to explain to me why he didn't like it.  See, Dave had just returned from a 1 month trip in south east Asia.  Dave said he didn't like the meal because his \""palate had changed\"".  Wow, sorry Dave.....I apologize that the Philadelphia Sandwich Company here in America doesn't use dog as its prime source of meat.  So Dave, some parting words of wisdom.  As the great Elbert Hubbard once said, \""Genius may have its limitations, but stupidity is not thus handicapped.\""",4
"I wanted to like this place, because it's a very nice place to watch a game, with plenty of TVs and good view lines.\n\nBut... the food!  Just not good enough.  The burgers are missing a key ingredient - taste!  Really overpriced, and the chef needs to figure out where to locate the seasoning.\n\nLastly, I don't think the waiter every made eye contact with the group.  Flying around, all sweaty and gnarls.  I have been rushed out of nicer burger places (read: In N Out).\n\nGo for the game and a beer, leave before the burger arrives.",1
"Homestead was fairly new when we tried it (kind of late on the review). The steaks are prime cuts and worth every penny. Great atmosphere and design in the dining room. The servers are very seasoned at what they do- 3 sips of water and they refilled in no time- Very good at attention to detail. The bone in ribeye is the best. So much flavor, aged just right- My wife got the prime rib- very good as well. Between the food and the service, the entire visit was exceptional. 5 stars- definitely recommend!",4
"totally worth it.  came in here twice in four days.. which says a lot given all the good food available in LV. \n\nSome hits and misses, but i cant say much about the misses because this is a Singaporean's take, and the cuisine can differ some across the causeway. Also, the restaurant IS called island Malaysian..\n\nalso, for those wondering about its similarities to Penang (the restaurant chain)-- the waitress said that it used to be a Penang chain but then other people bought it out.. so i guess the decor and the recipes via the cooks were retained? \n\nbut: \n\n1) sambal kangkong-- good ratio of leaves vs stems. sambal sauce was a little too thin for my liking, but i think it's a Malaysian thing. \n\n2) Char Kuay Tiao: Delicious to the max!! fried soft white noodles with fresh prawns and bean sprouts.. hmmm. they dont skimp on the bean sprouts either! but seriously, what is it with LV and awesomely fresh bean sprouts?! Kinh Do served up some super bean sprouts too. Our table of 7 inhaled 3 servings. \n\n3) Roti Canai: We had 4 servings.  crispy and chewy dough.. Curry was spot on authentic. Enough said. \n\n4) Hainanese chicken was meh.. at least they stuffed the bottom with fresh cucumber slices\n\n5) mee goreng was pretty good.. very malaysian styled though, ie sweet, a tad mushy, and with fried dough pieces in it\n\n6) house-made toufu was pretty sweet!  At this point we were so stuffed, but you could definitely taste and feel that the toufu was artisan-made and not from a factory. \n\n7) Barley drink-- great because it was tasty and not too sweet (critical, since other places would pour on the sugar syrup and then dilute the whole thing) but personally, ratio of barley grains to liquid in the glass was a tad off. \n\n8) ice kacang!! had it during our first meal there.  the waitress was so sweet.. I asked if it was possible to have more attap chee pieces cuz when i was young, my sis and i would fight perpetually over it, and she laughed and said that she'll put 5 pieces in it-- one for every person at our table! that's great service. \n\nI swear we ate several other dishes, but at this point in time.. my mind is still fixated on the roti canai and char kuay tiao.. LOL\n\nanyone craving straits cuisine-- GO!!!",3
I wasn't even planning on buying a vape... My boyfriend went in to get one but everyone there was so nice and friendly (even their cute pup!) and there were soooo many good flavors I ended up buying one!  The small starter one... They help me put it together & everything.  Great experience :),4
"Overpriced and under seasoned.....I tried the coconut soup with shrimp spice level 5 and the basil leaf with chicken spice level 7. For what its worth the coconut soup was only marginally better than the basil leaf mainly because I could at least tell that they attempted to season it. The shrimp however were way overcooked to the point of being rubbery and there were only 3 of them in the soup. Next the basil leaf was only \""hot\"" when the temperature of the food was; so much for the spice levels. It had no flavor at all and tasted like cheap chinese food which is unfortunate because the dish was not cheap. There you have it $20+ wasted on garbage. Dine at your own risk. If you are looking for Thai food I strongly recommend The Green Mango instead.",0
"$1 jello shots made from the bottom-of-the-barrel liqour.\n\nIt's a Vegas tradition, no matter how much you've \""matured\"" over the years.  Who knew $20 of jello shots could be so exciting?",3
"Stopped in one night during my business trip and had a medium pizza. Overall, it was ok -- but man did it remind me of Digiorno pizza, just cooked a in a better oven. \n\nEstablish was nice, watched a soccer game and staff was friendly. Just not the best pizza.",1
"Saw owner opening walmart chocolate chip cookies, and then repackaging them as their cookies, yuck! When they opened their first store it was great, but over the years the flavors have changed and the chicken is bone dry. Any grocery store rotisserre chicken is better. Ordered 1/2 rack ofribs  for $13.49 , they gave me 4 ratty looking ribs. Mashed potatoes are so bland. Gave this new store a chance but, not going back.",0
"For some reason I always park at Binion's. I was there this evening to eat nearby so I pulled in the self park. I know this is an older place but I wish they would update the elevator to the parking garage. I always use the stairs but I was with mom who was traveling all day and needed the elevator. We stayed and played a few slot machines for a few hours. There was only one cocktail waitress that came our way the entire time, that's pretty bad.",2
"I don't know why we keep going back. The girls are always new, because they can't keep anyone there. Apps and dinner always come out at the same time. So tonight we sent out app back; two reasons: it came\nOut with our food, it was cold. Maybe we should just stop trying to go on Wednesday!maybe it would be better.",1
"I went to grub hub to place my order. Since I run an at home daycare I wanted some good breakfast food. I had a $20.00 order. I submitted it then almost instantly my phone rang. The owner was very rude and told me the ONLY reason he was delivering my food is because I pre-paid thru the site. That he only delivers to commercial businesses. For one grub hub doesn't say that and when I called them they were as shocked as I was since he has never stated this. I will not lie, I will never walk foot into his deli. I do have a business n since my name isn't pet smart or something he doesn't want my business. Your loss I use grub hub a lot!! Anyway food was good, but I lost ALL respect for you sir! Remember your a small business owner as well n karma is a b!",0
"Yes there are a million Chinese take out places in Champaign-Urbana.  However this is one of the better ones.  When I am at work, late nights, they deliver and when you call there is always someone nice and helpful to help you.  Their prices are reasonable and the delivery people are very personable.  I generally order the Chicken Broccoli combination which comes with steamed or fried rice and an egg roll.  Their egg rolls are chicken and always nice and crispy.  I am a big fan of this place and have recomended it to my coworkers!",3
"Fast, fresh, hot, friendly",2
"I would not go back, I will not conduct business with them anymore.\n\nThey wasted my time and I wasted my money on them. I brought in a painting that was about 40 X 30 inches and weighted about 3lbs. I ask the blonde girl at the counter for an estimate to ship the painting as I was getting a few quotes for the shipping businesses in the area, she tells me it's going to be $50 total. \n\nSo, I come back in the next 2 days after thinking they had the best quote. I go through the process of sending out the painting and the lady (different person) tells me it's going to cost $233.14 in total. I was f''ing pissed AND now I'm in a time crunch to get this out before a meeting. I told the lady what I was quoted before, but all she could do was apologize and give me $5 off. I paid the f'ing amount and I was livid. I felt tricked and I would have went somewhere else if I had the time at that moment.\n\nI have many more paintings to mail out but I won't do business here again and I will let everyone of my business associates know of my horrible experience here.",0
"Great new place, had a large group of family in and it could not have been better.  Food was outstanding, really loved the tri tip nachos and the taco sampler platter.  Had a new beer I had heard about called Mex 1, it is a home town brewery and really was very good, would definitely recommend over corona.  Be on the look out for it!!  Service is excellent and friendly.  The owner Jeff even came by our table and made sure everything was perfect.  Next time you are close, it is a must try!!!",4
"Very nice staff, great selection!! I love the framboise. The smaller of the two is a bit cramped for me, and they could be a bit cleaner but that's practically every bar in existence. Really great specials. The clientele is so-so.",3
"I've stayed at many Embassy Suites accross america and by far this is the worst. Really bad housekeeping service. will only service if you ask. Worst yeat, the tub allows sewer gases to enter the bathroom. Yeah real nice. and check the in-room refridgerator before using it, ours was turned off. Overall this is a dump.",0
Stopped in looking for a great breakfast. Ordered the salmon hash. It tasted more like cat food than something edible by humans. The hash browns had no flavor and the eggs were served cold. The biscuit was rock hard and the service was mediocre. For having such a good reputation this restaurant was an exceptional disappointment. I'd advise others to look elsewhere for breakfast.,1
"Absolutely fantastic, amazing, awesome, plus more enthusiastic adjectives. Maybe I'll slip the word magnificent in here, as I've wanted to use it in a review for ages, but it's not exactly a word you can shove in anywhere, seeing as it usually describes palaces and mountains and other such things of an immense nature.\n\nBeing from Edinburgh, this of course makes me instantly biased when it comes to my opinions on the merits of the Edinburgh Fringe, but the facts are that this festival has been going for many, many years now, and is internationally renowned for the quality, multitude and variety of shows it offers, plus, and I think most importantly, it gives smaller acts, who often pass under the radar, a chance to shine.\n\nAfter many Augusts of experiencing what can be the frustration of trying to enjoy every part of the Fringe to the full, which is actually impossible, because it would take you around six years to see every single event happening at the festival, I've learned to plan ahead a bit. I figure out what I want tickets for in advance, as soon as the brochure comes out, but I also just go with whatever I feel like seeing on the spur of the moment, once the Fringe actually starts. Sometimes it's the random shows that can seem a bit dubious when you look at the flyer, that turn out to be surprisingly amazing. There is absolutely without a doubt something for everyone here, and I implore anyone thinking of coming to Scotland in August to visit Edinburgh and take in the crazy, chaotic, cultural carnival of amazingness that is the Fringe. August is when Edinburgh is at its best and most vibrant - you must experience it, you must!",4
This show exceeds all expectations. My husband and I were both blown away. The choreography and visual effects are super. I was teary eyed several times throughout the performance as it was so mind blowing and MJ was truly one of a kind. I recommend this to anyone who likes music. It is an uplifting show and a must see!,4
"Lovely for both sitting in and taking away, the Hula Juice Bar is a little ray of sunshine. It offers a lovely array of soups, to go with its range of signature smoothies.\n\nOverall, we said: \""It's always such a delight to see people enjoying what they're doing at the same time as producing things to a high quality. We'll be back to try more soups and wraps from their range, soon.\""",3

"I've been here a couple times before, but once I turned 21 this has been one of my go-to spots for happy hour because the specials are amazing! The fact that they have mini take home happy hour menus makes it all the more tempting as well. \n\nAllow me break it down for you:\nHappy hour is Mon-Fri 3pm-6pm, Sun-Wed 10pm-close\n\nDomestic Pints - $3.50, Craft&Import Pints - $4.25-$4.75\nSliders served on a bed of fries  ($6.75): Classic, Bearnaise, Pastrami, Turkey, Veggie. Ahi is $9.95\n\nHalf priced pizzas: BBQ chicken, 4cheese, Ham & pineapple, Margherita, Pepperoni & Mushroom, Spicy Thai Chicken\n\nHalf priced apps: Crab cakes, Calamari, Cali Roll, Chinese Garlic Noodles, Chicken Nachos, Onion Ring Tower, Wings, Boneless wings, Veggie wings, Hawaiian Poke stack, Spicy tuna roll, Seared Ahi Sashimi, Chicken lettuce wraps, Fried chicken strips, spinach cheese dip, Moo Shu egg rolls\n\nDoesn't that just BLOW your mind? It's like a plethora of cheap happy hour eats and you'll probably get full off of one order of sliders, or 2 of their apps. \n\nSo far I've tried:\n-Bearnaise sliders (Bearnaise sauce and fried shoestring onions on the patty w/ a side of very skinny fries that are tenderly cooked with a very light batter coating which gives them a perfectly crunchy exterior and \""juicy\"" inside)\n-BBQ chicken and Margherita pizzas (They pretty much taste as they should. Sometimes the BBQ chicken is a little too saucy for my taste though)\n-calamari (Yum. Perfectly fried on the outside and melting on the inside. Served w/ marinara and, I wanna say tartar sauce? I usually go with the red..)\n-Traditional wings (First and last time I had these, they were so spicy! My bf couldn't even handle them and he claims to love hot stuff, hehe. The thing that I don't like about these wings is that you can't choose how spicy you want them, so you have to be prepared for whatever they give you)\n\nEverything I've tried has been pretty good so far and there is still so much more I have yet to try! I know my boyfriend has been having some sort of frenzy over the happy hour poke stack. He's gone to this location about 4 times in the past month, by himself, just to sit and eat the poke stack, so I can only guess how delicious it must be. \n\nKey points:\n-Happy hour is awesome here\n-Traditional wings are hot! (at least for me)\n-Calamari is delectable\n-French fries are close to perfect\n-Great for groups\n-Service has been pretty fast on the days that I've gone",3
Service was awful. Food was ok but for the price... You can definitely find better. Warning!!! Do not let the server suggest what to order... He will pick the most expensive dishes on the menu and will fail to tell you how much it is.. They should definitely warn you that your dinner for two will cost u nearly $1000.00!!! UNBELIEVABLE!!! THESE PEOPLE ARE STRAIGHT UP CROOKS!!!!,0
"jakes has threatened me when I said what my experience which was not at all what I paid for I went in for a tune up in my Mercedes and I guess he thought I was rich! he charged me 311.00 and when I went and picked it up there was no old parts in the car nor did he show me them like he had said he did in his attorneys letter I received after putting my experience with him on the internet sayin I would be sued if I didn't take it down. I got scared so I did when I was informed that I have every right to voice my experience with the freedom of speech act I am now putting it back up as his threats have no merit and he just wants to bully people .I went and picked up my car paid him cash got into my car and the light was still on so I said hey the light is still on he then told me to pull it in he opened hood and obviously  unplugged it within seconds and said ok its ready to go I thought hmmm.I drove the car for a few weeks and it wasn't running any better and no gas saving ,so I returned with my friend that was picking me up asked where the old parts where if he put them in my car as that's what she has and she wanted to look at my receipt I told her no old parts where left in my car and he never gave me a receipt when I picked it up she then asked jake if he had my old parts and could she get a copy of the receipt he was less than happy and said he would go look for them was gone a few minutes and said nope he threw them away and as he lied in the letter saying he showed me the old parts he never did then he said he gave me the receipt and I said nio sir you did not he wanted to know why she wanted a copy and she replied because if you cant get it right I want it to show my mechanic so he knows what you have done already he was obviously not happy I picked my car up and he was rude and short ,when I asked him for a copy of the work he did he then threw a copy of the work he has done I said I wont be back that's when he yelled at me get the f--ck off his property he didn't want me back I said that's great service wonder how long you will be in business.I then drove my car another couple of weeks still no better than when I took it in to begin with so I had another mechanic check it and was told no new spark plugs no filter no tune up he did nothing,i went back and asked for a refund telling him I had 2 mechanics that told me no tune up was made on my car and we would go to court he said letrs go to court I said ok and he once again told me to get the fckkk out of his business and then is when he said he put a new motor mount on my car I thought he was lying again never got a receipt for that until I got it in the letter from the attorney I said to him I wanted a tune up and never asked for a motor mount which I was told you never put just one motor mount you always do both as Mercedes only have 2 to begin with and never spoke to jake about any motor mount I didn't even know about motor mounts and I paid for tune up .Then I put up on internet my experience and got a certified letter from his attorney stating I had 3 days to take down my review or be sued and I hadn't talked to an attorney and was scared so i I did. I have now researched my legal rights and have every right to share with the public my expierence from jakes auto body so others don't get the same rip off I did as he lies and steals money wont back his work and is very unprofessional DONT BELIEVE ALL THE GOOD REVEIWS HES HAD TO BULLY THE REAL REVIEWS TO GET THEM REMOVED BUT IM WILLING TO GO TO COURT SO NO ONE ELSE GETS BULLIED AND RIPPED OFF BY JAKE",0
"Food was ok. Mediocre over priced foods. The problem is that I think they are lost in finding their own identity. Japanese food with a twist but they seemed to be trying too hard in the casual setting restaurant. \n\nwhat made our dinner one bad dinner is when we found out that the server and the managements were not on the same page. It was very awkward and we just ended up taking the damage caused by the server because the way he tried to correct the issue was not right. (I don't want to talk about the details because it may point out the individual.) Also, one of managers who explained us about their whiskey collection had no smile at all even though we were smiling the whole time. The whole experience was so awkward that I will never forget. Managements and the employees clearly need more communication.\n\nWish we went to some good local restaurant. That is all I can say after eating at this place.",0
"Amazing!!! I have been here four times and each time I've been impressed. I just had Anne do my acrylic nails with gel polish and she literally had me in and out in les than 45 minutes. Not only do my nails look spectacular, but the salons customer service is always on point. Tony, the owner is a crack up so if you get him, you're in for a treat.",4
Terrible. I drove all the way to Matthews from Huntersville for pants that they said were in stock. I'm extremely disappointed that they were NOT. Thanks for wasting my time with inaccurate stock counts Old Navy!,0

I had been taking my MazdaSpeed3 to Chapman Mazda since I bought it two years ago.  I had always been satisfied until this week.  My services used to run about $40 and they were done in a hour or less.  Yesterday it took over 2.5 hours and it cost me $350.  And there was nothing wrong with it.  They also used to have 2 waiting rooms and they don't any more.  I won't be taking my Mazda back to Chapman and I won't be buying a new Mazda (planned for next year) from them either.,0
"The only thing that I would suggest here is getting their ice cold beer. One of the girls suggested a flavored beer which was pretty good. It was like a tea mix or something. Other than that, the food was nothing to die for. The sliders buns were pretty hard and we didn't even eat them. The one decent thing was the buffalo wings. From what I recall they don't call it buffalo, but it was pretty much buffalo sauce. The girl was nice but wait times were heavy. It's nice inside but just another normal place. Not too crazy about it, probably wouldn't go unless it was somewhere someone really wanted to go.\n\nThese girls gotta learn how to smile and look friendly, not snotty and stuck up. Just sayin!",1
"One of our favorite places.  Great beer, amazing BLT, plenty of choice for burgers, great for kids, friendly staff",3
"Go there if you want to spend $21 for two hot dogs and fries.... I asked for a Diet Coke and the waitress looked at me like I was an alien before explaining that all their beverages were organic and made with blah blah blah.... Please remember that you're serving hot dogs, oh and the frites (fries) were basically crumbs.\n\nI won't be back.",1
"Maybe the only place that closes in Vegas, Todd English opens at 11am,  a miss for those in search of morning pub fare as an alternative to the traditional Vegas brunch options.\n\nRaw bar is very good, with the lobster cocktail hitting all the marks: fresh and abundant, served in the shell (full tail and claws!) with a homemade cocktail sauce.  The sliders were average, the frites were frozen (my life's biggest angst...); while my colleague had English fish and chips, while it was cod (yum!) it did not look hand dipped, and again with the frozen \""chips'...\n\nI asked for Guinness, and while the server (who was very attentive and friendly) never said anything, I know she was feeding me semi-stout from a local brewery. Why not just say so?  If I ask for Diet Coke, servers typically go out of their way to say \""We only have diet Pepsi...\""  but I digress.\n\nImpressive facility (hell, its Vegas...) but didn't have the requisite pubby feel to it. And $140 for lunch for two (3 pints each) is a bit rich.  Yeah, yeah, maybe I don't need 3 pints at lunch... save it.\n\nOh! and they have a hot dog on the menu for $18...wtf?",2
"First, the pizza - it grew on me.  Its simplicity fooled me at first but after a few pieces I began to crave more.  My only complaint is that it could have used a few more minutes in the oven.  The crust was a bit doughy for a thin-crust pizza.  \n\nThe caprese salad was decent but not outstanding.  It was served ice-cold and tasted much better toward the end of the meal once it warmed a bit.  \n\nThe wine was served in 'juice' glasses which was a cool touch of authentic Italian dining.  \n\nThe service was pleasant but not fancy.  The semi-prominent  gas fireplace 'doesn't work because we have no gas'.  Okaay.  \n\nOverall a decent place.  The prices were ok and the pizza does have something special.  Probably better for lunch or a weeknight than a Saturday night dinner.",2
"Amazing price for karaoke. Completely blows California prices out of the water.\n\n50% off Mon-Thurs\n20% off Fri-Sat\n\nAlcoholic drinks- buy 2 get 1 free\n\nI was in the medium sized room with 8 people including myself, and found it to be a nice fit with a little bit of extra space. The owners/staff are incredibly friendly and considerate. They gave us free fruit because we were there for New Year's Eve/New Year's.\n\nThe variety of Korean/Japanese songs is incredible. Although most of us had trouble singing the Korean songs, the American songs were fun to sing as well. Though they don't have a big selection of the more recent mainstream songs, Backstreet Boys never fails me. There are a few funny typos here and there, but it's nothing that we can't out sing.\n\nThere are only two mics, but what the heck, you only need two singers at a time since everyone's capable singing without the mic anyway. The sound system was great, it was seriously loud, maybe a little too loud in the room! I probably had a little hearing loss from that.\n\nIt was super hot in the room, but it was probably from everyone jumping and singing and getting too excited. I definitely had a good experience here.",4
"In the ranks of the worst buffets i have ever went to. Save your $ and go to Bellagio.\n\nFirst, the wait was long as hell. Ok, i understand, allot of places are packed now, their must be something good in here right? Wrong!\n\nNo crab legs. Strike 1.\nOysters literally spoiled, i had to spit it out. Strike 2\nMeat from the cutting board, dry. Strike 3. \n\nI really don't think i actually enjoyed anything here besides dessert. \n\nWait staff was slow to clear dishes from my table.\n\nLook, i am really trying to pick something nice out about this place so i can give it a 2 but i cant. Maybe the scenery is cool, the surroundings. I was impressed by the Paris itself, the casino is nice. I was happy till i got on the line, then nothing from thereon in was good. \n\nI wont go back, a 2/5 deserves a second try, not this place.",0

"Been here a few other times that were great this last time made me think again. We had the onion rings amazing! They come withTwo dipping sauces which is cool. I had the  Fish and chips they were little dry and one piece of fish was not cooked right was soggy and seemed to placed on the bottom to hide it. I would have thought it was a fluke if the other piece on the bottom was the same but it wasn't. Next was the service.  It was not as good as it has been other times. We were never asked if everything looked ok or tasted ok or if we needed anything else. I could have maybe understood this I it were busy but it wasn't busy at all and I've been here when it was busy. We waited a while before we could even get our waiters attention to talk about the fish problem and even get the check. The guy didn't seem to care much he just got me a new piece. After we got the check we probably waited another 10 minutes for him to come back to the payment. It just sucks that this last visit was so poor when the last two times we went here we had the same waiter and he was awesome and the food was great, but after this visit I wish I could give 2 1/2 stars but I'll give 3 because of the other visits that were great.",2
"A truly unique dining experience! A must for any music lover!\n\nI celebrated my mom's birthday with family and friends. The pizza we had was good. The salad bar was fresh. The ice cream for dessert was premium.\n\nThe highlight, of course, was the music. The organist has the capability to play anything. I am sure there are exceptions, but he handled many of the requests we submitted and played music I would have not thought possible with the organ. He played big band music, Broadway musicals, movie music including Disney songs and symphony music, as well as some pop songs (Michael Jackson's Thriller). Music included lights, a cat puppet show for the song \""Alley Cat\"", and even bubbles for \""Under the Sea\"".\n\nConversation was difficult during the music show, but that's to be expected and did not detract from our enjoyment.\n\nAll food/drink purchases are cash/debit only. There is a gift shop with t-shirts, CDs, etc. as well.",4
"Not that I don't love Paradies because I do, it's just that I will not attend this Paradise ever again. Paradise gets busy, but when you have been waiting for your meal for 30 minutes, and people that arrive after you get their meals before you do, that is a problem. Then to make matters worse, the young girl that worked there gave me a bad attitude for her miscommunication error. She also snapped at her co-worker in the presence of myself and other patrons. That was not professional. She then tried to rectify her mistake (with attitude of course), so I just left, and decided that I would not go back. I use to frequent this locatioin because it is 10 minutes away, but too many times I've had to wait a rediculous amount of time, and watch others that arrive after me, get better service. Needless to say, I will drive to any other Paradise, but this one.",0

The service is alright the staff could have a lot better customer service.\n\nThe staff seemed preoccupied with side conversations.

"OK, so check this out.  I know I have been long dormant with the Yelp reviews (bad girl, BAD GIRL!), so to make it up to ya'll, I am now embarking on a casino-by-casino tour of my new hometown of LV, NV, and will include reviews of each as I tour them.  Now, these will not include room stays, but just schlepping around the premises - eating, drinking, and checking out anything that moves or doesn't move.  Got it? OK, let's proceed...\n\nReview #26:\na fairly nice locals casino in Summerlin; I like it a lot better than the nearby Rampart/Marriott casino; the focus is definitely on gaming/slots, but there is a nice mix of other things to do here; decent cluster of dining options, and mercifully lacking the usual low-end food court that you'd expect; there is also a big multiplex theater here, and the upstairs features a large bowling alley; the sports book is quite big & impressive; there seems to be a lot of bars per capita here, which is always a good thing; best craft beer bet = the recently opened The Game sports bar easily takes the cake, with 20 craft beers on tap, including several local brews; plus, the food here is suprisingly good, and the waitresses are stuffed into hot referee outfits - yes, please!",2
"Great small USO located by Carousel 21 in Terminal 3.  Hours are from 8am to 8pm.\n\nDavid, the volunteer on duty, was very professional, friendly and attentive.\n\nEverything was very clean and organized.

"Ever since moving from Okinawa Japan to Goodyear Arizona(Yes a huge move) I have been looking for quality sushi that best comes to the real deal. I found Akai Hana about a year and a half ago and it is the best Sushi place around. I go in at least 1-2 times a month and each time get great quality service from their staff.\n\nThe food is delicious and I keep going back, Happy hour is the busiest for obvious reasons, at times we have had to wait a bit for the orders but it is worth it for the food and price you get it at. Even if you do not like sushi, they menu is quite extensive and like the sushi it is all great.",4
Popped in here last night for dinner and it was great!  It is located in the breezeway between the Duke Energy Building and the Mint Museum.  You can park on the street or one of the many parking garages near by.\n\nThe atmosphere is a little on the trendy side.  You can sit at the bar and watch your sushi made in front of you or get one of the many booths and tables.  It isnt a huge restaurant and I didnt need reservations for dinner last night.  I think it is probably more packed when there are events at the Knight Theatre etc.\n\nWe had the calamari app - very spicy and not too heavily breaded.  Crispy and delicious.  I ordered the Yum Yum roll and a simple spicy tuna roll - both were very cold and delicious!  My friend ordered the Cherry Blossom roll which was a bit over the top but good :-)\n\nThey have my FAV wine - Conundrum....which is hard to find at area restaurants.  Heavy pours and very friendly bar staff.  Everyone was super nice and I would definitely go again (even tho it was a bit pricey.)  Thanks guys!,2
"Been waiting for 1.5 hours for a wash and shampoo.  I was told it would be done in 2 hours, and they haven't even started!  Service is horrible.

I have given this place so many chances.  \nMy car had better look good after this fiasco.",0
"Dinner June 11\n  This is a very classy, upscale type place that I had very high hopes for, but unfortunately I cant give more than an average rating.\n   Here's what I liked:\n   - The ambience\n   - The wait staff - very attentive and friendly\n   - Grilled Flounder was cooked and seasoned perfectly\n   - The accompanying Aioli with the Trout was fantastic\n   - The Meatloaf was unique tasting with a nice crispy crust and tasty center\n   - Cornbread appetizer was very large and was pretty good\n   - Homemade Creamy Garlic salad dressing was outstanding!\n  Here's what I didn't like:\n   - Appetizers were few (need more variety and offerings)\n   - Double Dip appetizer - Pimento Cheese was not mixed thoroughly as every bite seemed different - either overly flavorful or just bland!\n    - Tortilla Chips just didn't seem a good pairing with the Pimento Cheese. Chips were good with Guacamole, but think a pita chip or some type cracker would of been better.\n    - In the side salad the red cabbage was so bitter that it over powered every bite I took and made the salad almost inedible - dressing was great\n    - I ordered Trout and it just came out on the plate, with no side or anything accompanying it.  When I asked, the waitress was like oh yeah, it should come with rice or broccoli.  Shouldn't someone of noticed just a piece of fish alone on the plate before it was sent out?\n    - The person that ordered Meatloaf asked for Fries (not mashed potatoes) and his plate arrived with the Mashed.  Informed waitress and  he eventually got a side order of fries. \n  ++ that's 2 orders out of 4 that came out wrong!  At a restaurant like this that shouldn't happen.  \n   Yes I would go back at some point, but there are many places I want to try before I give them another chance.",2
"Convenient if you stay at the Tuscany Hotel, otherwise, you can find so much better. We had dinner there, then breakfast. Dinner : we ordered pizzas, and i'm pretty sure mine was bought at Walmart and defrosted. Breakfast : not very good, and I suspect it made me sick.",1
"I've added an extra star - their customer service outreach has been terrific.\n\nThey have lots and lots of stuff, some of it really nice. What they don't have is high quality stuff. Most of the stuff we have seems flimsier at home than it did at the store.\n\nAlso, their delivery was not very professional. No care was taken with our home or furniture.\n\nWe would likely buy there again, but only if they had something we couldn't get elsewhere.",2
"The prices are super cheap, buy your spices here. Also, the restaurant is amazing. The beef shawerma sandwich with a yogurt drink is incredible. If you get fries, get the garlic butter dip.",4
"Great business, friendly staff. I bout a 2013 Ninja 650 here, the salesmen were not pushy at all, and very helpful for a new rider such as my self. The service dept is also very friendly, I've taken it in a few times for basic tuneups and they do exactly what I ask for and the pricing is very reasonable.",4
"Hayla saved my wedding dress! It came with a lot of problems from the factory and I had brought it to David's Bridal 4 times, each time they didn't fix it completely, until the head seamstress there at David's Bridal told me nothing more could be done \""and you're going to have to deal with it\"" (bumpy layers of fabric on my waist, too small at hips and the collar wasn't even.) \nI took it to Hayla and she said no problem at all! She figured out the problems with the layers and materials quickly, fixed it by hand and it turned out beautiful! Hayla really cared how I felt about the dress and her work, and that means so much! I would definitely recommend Hayla to anyone!",4
"Great food! Good Time!...Even Better service.\n\nWe were in town to celibrate daughters graduation from UNLV. We told her we would take her wherever she wanted.

"Let me start by saying that I do like their food. \n\nLast night I went with my wife and two guests. The apps came out fast and were fantastic. Dinner on the other hand, didn't come out quickly at all. The rice was undercooked, and we told our server. He set the rice on the empty table next to us and forgot to bring a new order. By the time I was almost finished with my meal, another server came over and they brought back another bowl of crunchy white rice.\n(is that the way rice is prepared now?)\n\nI ordered the chocolate cake. I asked for a container to take half home. The server brought out a small container and when I asked for a larger one, she said we can just squeeze it in there, and started to flatten the cake. She then realized that a larger one would be better.\n\n4 people, not crowded...2 hours total.",1
"Dealing with the Service Advisor at this dealership is useless. They make promises and don't keep them!

Good luck on getting warranty work done at this place, or as far as that matters, any good quality work, with good customer service!

"Did you know that BLT Steakhouse has a Blackboard Menu?? 4 courses (Appetizer, Main Course, Side and Dessert), $40, no substitutions.  Sounds great right?  How did I learn this??  Not from my server I didn't. \nAfter hubby and I sat down and had placed our order from the big standard menu given to us by our server Sam (short for Samantha), I noticed that tables around us  had been given an additional handout along with their menus.  I was able to eye the handout from the adjacent table (we were really close cause my eyes are not all that good) and it read:  Blackboard Menu.  I asked a passing server if I could have a copy.  He graciously provided me with one.  The Blackboard Menu read as follows-\nChoice of appetizer (including salads) , a main course choice of Prime Flat Iron Steak, Wild Coho Salmon or Roasted Jidori Chicken with cornbread/ mesquite honey jus; Side order of Fried Green Tomatoes (which I adore), house-made tater tots, or broccoli mac and cheese and of course a dessert which included as one of the choices Peanut butter chocolate mousse.  You think maybe if presented with the Blackboard Menu I might have chosen to order from it??? YOU BETCHA.   \nSo why wasn't I given the Blackboard Menu? Did we look too old and rich to be given this menu?  Well, I asked Sam, our server about why we didn't get this menu.  She coyly said, Oh....  Well,  you can order from that menu when you come back tomorrow!\""   Being that it was my husband's birthday and I didn't want to spoil it for him, I didn't give her the answer that she deserved.  Normally, I would have said what I wanted to say and then walked out.   So I should come back the next day to get an option that I should have been offered today!? Really. Nice answer.  Good going, Sam.   Hubby was set on getting his Waygu, but for me the Blackboard Menu gave me some delightful options. \n\nThinking about what I ordered, the Grilled Shrimp,  without a sauce it is nothing more than large grilled shrimp that I could have made at home, but probably better.  I had asked Sam about the soy-citrus sauce that was available and she assured me the shrimp were marinated and didn't need the sauce.  Wrong again.  The broccoli mac and cheese would have been fine if the cream had been absorbed into the macaroni.  The cream was just a liquid in which the macaroni was floating.   Needed more oven time.  As prepared, it was nothing special.  Hubby's Waygu was perfectly cooked as was the baked potato (LOL) and grilled asparagus. He asked for chimichuri sauce which did not come until he had to request it again. Desserts were fine.   \nWe think that knowing that Sam did not give us the Blackboard Menu in order to raise the bill and garner a larger tip is disconcerting.  With us, the tip is about service not the total amount of the bill.  We usually tip very generously irrespective of the total bill.  This whole event kind of spoiled the evening for us.",1
"I really enjoyed Barrington's the only time I've visited. The dining room is TINY to say the least and you obviously must have a reservation. My date and I brought our own bottle of wine, which was decanted and gladly served by our server. My date complained a bit that he thought our server was a tad too stuffy but I personally think he was just being picky. \n\nFrom what I remember, the food was pretty excellent and the ambiance was very nice and romantic. This would probably not be the place to go wearing your casual duds. I wore a dress while my date wore a jacket and slacks. I had heard people rave about this restaurant but I would like to go back just one more time to get the full effect. Barrington's almost reminded me of Passion8 Bistro down in South Carolina, although, I would prefer to return to Passion8 Bistro because of their awesome food.\n\nI think Barrington's is a great restaurant for a special date night because of it's quiet and quaint atmosphere and attentive service. The experience will definitely leave you feeling pampered... and the money you spend will be relative to that treatment. But totally worth it for that special occasion!",3

"I usually shy away from spanish restaurants, as I find that very often all you end up with are loads of little plates that all look and taste of exactly the same two ingredients - paprika and grease. I was invited out to dinner here last night, and I'm pleased to announce that my preconceptions have been proved wrong by Iggs & Barioja.\n\nThe name is a bit weird and confusing, it's true. The Iggs part is their more formal, men-should-probably-wear-a-jacket sort of place where you eat a full \u00e1 la carte meal rather than tapas. The other side of the room is Barioja (there are separate entrances but it's pretty much all one pace), which is where we ate.\n\nWe'd all had a fairly big lunch, so we didn't really need a huge meal. We got 6 tapas dishes between the 3 of us, with a basket of bread and olives, and it was just the right amount of food.\n\nThe tapas menu is literally pages long. And aside from all the things you'd expect to find, like serrano ham wrapped around manchego cheese, or patatas bravas, there were a huge a number of dishes I'd never heard of - and I've just spent a year living in spain and south america! \n\nMy personal favourite was the cod: on the menu it simply said \""cod seared in saffron\"", but what arrived was way better... It was like when you get to the till and find that the gorgeous pair of shoes you're buying are actually half price! There were 4 huge chunks of cod, filled with some kind of goat's cheese, walnut and garlic pur\u00e9e, and it was unbelievably good.\n\nIf you're into your wines, particularly your reds, then you'll love this place. The house wines start at \u00a319 a bottle, and go up to \u00a33,000, so even the most discerning wine buff will find something they like.\n\nFor 6 tapas, bread, olives, and a bottle of house wine, you can expect to pay around \u00a345 in total.",4

"First off, the food is excellent.  Fried Green Tomatoes are delicious, and everything was very good or better.  \n\nHOWEVER, I have to give the service an \""F\"", and not because of our waitress, but an odd policy that made our experience there downright angering.  We had a large party of 15 for which we made a reservation in advance.  Upon asking to split the check, we were told by our waitress that restaurant policy was to not allow split checks, but they would accept multiple credit cards to pay the final tab.  I expressed my concern over this, given that figuring out the bill for 15 people would be a huge task.  I asked for clarification on that rule, which I never got.  Our waitress would only tell us it was the policy and she could do nothing about it.\n\nSure enough, when the bill came, mass confusion began.  We had a $600 tab that we had to figure out amongst ourselves.  First submission of cards proved that the total came up short, despite our math that put us at just above the total.  The waitress was frustrated with the confusion, and she asked if I would like to speak to the manager to figure this out.  I said yes, but she returned shortly to tell me that her manager just said \""that's restaurant policy\"".   After over 30 minutes of trying to work amongst ourselves and with our waitress, we finally got it settled.  During all this confusion and frustration, the manager looked on and said nothing, and refused to address the issue for both his customers and his waitress.\n\nWhy would a restaurant defer this sort of problem to his customers to figure out for themselves?  Our waitress suggested this was time saving for the staff.  Clearly this did nothing but cause problems for everyone involved.  She was perhaps more frustrated than we the customers were, and the manager left her high and dry to deal with it herself.  That is poor customer service.   It was enough to leave us with a bad experience at Southern Rail.  Sure, the food was good, but that doesn't matter if the \""policy makers\""  make policies that hurts its customers, and then gives no explanation as to their policy.  \n\nI will think twice before considering dining at Southern Rail again.  If you are going with a party, take into consideration that at the end of your meal, you are going to be tasked with figuring out how to divide your bill.",1
"Love ethnic? Already tried Thai, Moroccan and Tandoori? Looking for a new culinary adventure? (Isn't that a lot of question marks?)\n\nThen might I suggest a visit to Mi Cocina, Mi Pais, for a culinary tour of Ecuador, along with its southerly neighbors, Colombia and Peru. \n\nMi Cocina, Mi Pais is a cheerful, mango-painted little corner in a Phoenix strip mall. There's only a handful of tables, so you may need to plan to wait or order to take-out.\n\nThere are plenty of familiar-ish dishes, such as tacos and tamales. \n\nBut to really get the full impact of the restaurant, but you should try one of the more unique choices here. Such as, shrimp and plantains, ceviche, or aji chile wrapped in banana leaf. \n\nMore reasons to visit? (And more question marks?) The portions are huge, and the prices very reasonable.",4
"OMG!! The smell of this place! If you enjoy the smell of warm vomit as you walk back to your hotel room then by all means book a room here.\n\nI stayed here with some girlfriends because we got a free room and even though it was free it was hard not to complain. The hotel is a run down dump. The only highlight was how much time we didn't have to stay in the room!! \n\nWe did have a pool view from our room but no one seemed to be partaking in poolside fun. The room service was prompt but the food was horrendous. Basically for $10 you get a reheated chicken patty with plastic processed cheese and soggy fries that look like they were scraped from the neighbors plate they left in the hall.\n\nUnless you must, must, must stay here don't and I hope the next time I have to see this place it is when they are building a new hotel over it.",0

"We stayed at the Mandarin Oriental and rarely ventured out of the hotel for food - the food at Mozen was so delicious, we wanted to try everything! Over the three days that we were there, we practically had every meal there! \n\nI became obsessed with their yogurt parfait for breakfast - I had it for three consecutive days and still could not get enough of it. They make their yogurt fresh in-house. The vanilla flavor was so exquisite and pure, I've never had anything like it! And I'm not even usually a yogurt fan! When I mentioned to the waiter that I loved it, he had me write down my email. The next day, the chef of Mozen himself, Vivek Rawat, wrote me an email thanking me for my patronage and attached the recipe! He even said I could feel free to email him back if I needed clarification! I was floored!\n\nWe went several times for breakfast, lunch, and dinner. Every single thing we tried there was incredibly delicious! The service was impeccable. Everyone was super attentive and nice. We will definitely be returning next time we visit Las Vegas.",4
"As a lover of food, especially fish, I recommend Milos for ONE reason.  The quality of the food.  If you want the freshest fish in town, come here.\n\nHowever...if you value great service, fantastic atmosphere, and want to be happy you just spent a few hundred dollars on a meal for two, don't come here.\n\nWe started off with a glass of wine (greek selections only by the glass) It didn't make me wanna take my shoes off and squish grapes at a winery...it was just ok.\n\nWe TRIED to order regular jumbo prawns, but \""teeth\"" (that's her nickname) suggested the Portuguese Longines Shrimp.  WRONG!!!\n\nI not only managed to slice my thumb and jab my pointer finger trying to open this, but also got lemon juice in that same wound!  It was a nightmare!!  First off, I've never seen one of these \""shrimp\"" before, and they're life size!  They come looking devious, with two giant claws and eyes bulging and beady!  Shortly after, I took the \""class\"" out of fine dining and said \""Can I please have a shot of Jameson and a Coors Light?\""  (They didn't have Coors Light, and I immediately don't trust a restaurant that doesn't carry Coors Light!)\n\nWe also ordered grilled peppers thinking they'd come out like the delicious Mediterranean style, with a bold flavor, spices, vinaigrette, and more...NOPE.\n\nFinally, our fish (Sea Bass) came out, it was very fresh, but very boring.  It was simple, with Olive Oil, Capers, and Lemon, but nothing Mediterranean about it.  Matter of fact, nothing about this experience was Greek/Mediterranean, so that was a disappointment.\n\nService was poorly executed.  Glasses were empty, we had to ask another server (on top of the two we had designated to us) to refill drinks, and might have seen our main server twice.\n\nNot a great first time experience, I won't go back.  \n\nOne solo entertaining moment...the gentleman to the left of us was wearing the IDENTICAL shirt as the servers...note to self, DO NOT wear a blue and white plaid long sleeve button up when dining at Milos!!

As an artificial sweeteners user we were disappointed that REAL Sweet & Low and Equal were replaced by generic ones. The pumpkin muffin was dry and my wife questioned if they are made fresh daily. Our omelet was not that hot either.  Side of two pancakes were not of uniform size and not as good as they used to be. $20 for a below average meal, not worth it.",1
"We bought a used SUV from this Carmax in June to 2014. We were not sure what we wanted and were allowed to wander the lot for awhile with out a sales person...\nOverall nice experience during the sales process.  \n\nStrike One- Noticed a few things wrong with car after we got it home. one of the doors was not closing correctly and had terrible wind noise at Freeway speed. HINT- insist that the test drive include freeway driving. Also noticed the outside mirrors  did not move. Carmax offered to repair both at no charge (nice recovery)! It took 6 days to get the car back.\n\nStrike two- We  are going on a road trip this weekend so I decided to give the SUV a check-up myself. I was shocked to find the air filter and the Cabin air filter beyond dirty. I have never seen an air filter this dirty and the cabin filter was even worse full of leaves and dirt. We have only put 400 miles on the car and it parks in a garage.  \n\nYes I know, buyer beware. However, I asked if Carmax serviced the car and what was done when we bought it.  The answer: All fluids, filters and the rest of findings from their multi-point inspection have been replaced.  \n\nBottom line: I don't trust Carmax. If you buy from them, have the car checked out by a professional shop. \n\nI won't buy from them again.",0
"Being that I don't really live in the area, and it is the OLDEST of the \""Station Casinos\"" (starting as Bingo Palace in 1976), I make it a point to avoid Palace Station. It seems a bit run-down, old, and there is a \""funky\"" odor about it. \n\nI've eaten at the buffet several times prior to 2004, but stopped going when I had a bad experience, not to mention moving into another part of town. I usually stick close to where I live when it comes to eating.\n\nNow, I've been to the Santa Fe Station's buffet, the one at Red Rock, Green Valley Ranch, Sunset Station, and even Texas Station. They're awesome. I do love GVR and Santa Fe buffets more. \n\nPalace Station? My visit on 9/19/2014 was a reminder of why I don't go there. \n\nBeing that I played \""myVegas\"" Rewards on Facebook, I was delighted to see that they had \""comps\"" and rewards to Red Rock, Palace Station, and another Station Casino.\n\nSince my mom works 4-hours on Fridays, I decided that the lunch would be a great idea since she works in the area. \n\nIt was the worst idea. Thankfully, it was free. That's the only good part of the meal and experience.\n\nFirst I had to stop at the Rewards Center to get my \""comp\"", then it was upstairs to the buffet. There was no one in line, so my mom and I walked up to the counter. The cashier was quite nasty even before I brought out the comp slip. I had to show my Driver License and Boarding Pass. \n\nThe cashier rung up the meal, and handed my \""loyalty\"" card to my mother and dismissed me entirely; despite the fact it was MY \""comp\"" that paid for the meal. The cashier didn't even look at me as she handed the card and receipt to my mother. \n\nAt age 38, I think I've passed the \""oh, you look so young stage\"" that the cashier felt she needed to hand my card to my mother. Sorry, but I found that insulting. One has to be 21 to get a \""Boarding Pass\"", and mine has my \""member since date\"" on it. It was issued in 1997, over 17 years ago. \n\nGetting over that incident, my mother handed my Boarding Pass back to me so I could put it in MY wallet. That didn't start off the experience that well. But, I let it go. Maybe for some reason, the cashier was having a bad day. \n\nThen we waited, and waited ... for about 15 minutes to be seated. The reason? NONE. There were PLENTY of tables. In the one section we were seated in, there were only eight other patrons. That area could easily seat 150, or more. Yet, we had to wait. \n\nSorry, but if you have the seating available ... you should seat your patrons asap. But, that's my take on it. \n\nAll unoccupied tables were clean and ready for people to sit at, so it wasn't as if they'd been busy and were cleaning up. \n\nWe were able to order the drinks quite quickly, but once we got our food? We weren't asked if we wanted refills on our drinks until we were bone dry, and ready to leave. We were cleaning up our area, and grabbing our purses when we were asked if we wanted refills. \n\nNo thanks, we're leaving.\n\nThe staff didn't bother to check on us, only took the dirty plates and walked away -- place wasn't that busy either. Again, only eight people in our section, and there were 3-4 servers working the area. Maybe they're having a bad day. So, I figured we'd ease their load and leave.\n\nAs far as the food ... \n\nThe food was terrible. Honestly, it SUCKED! \n\nIn addition to such a small selection, the meats, including the turkey were OVERCOOKED, TOUGH, and DRY. The supposedly \""hot\"" pasta was COLD, most of the cold foods were on the warm side, the warm foods? Stone cold. The only good thing? The desserts.They were the ONLY edible part of the meal. \n\nAgain, since it was free, I can't complain too much. But, I wouldn't pay for it whether or not it is a \""great value\"". Isn't a great value if you can't eat much of the selection and the service is not up to par. \n\nMaybe they were having a terrible day, maybe they were off. But, I don't think I will visit again. I can't justify rating a place simply on price. I have been to better, and I've been to the worst. The worst was the old (now gone) Boardwalk Holiday Inn Buffet on the strip. This one? I'll pass. It's not going to be the end of my world.",0
"I want desperately to like this place. I keep going back in the hopes that things will change, improve somehow.  Yet each time I am confronted with one disaster after another.  The last time, it was roasted potatoes that were still frozen in the middle.  Before that, wrong cocktail order (but major points for a breakfast joint that serves booze), repeated requests for silverware/creamer/sugar ignored.

"What? Only one review for Blue Fin on Yelp (as of October 2007)? That's crazy! This place is a true gem. Oh wait, maybe that's why there's only one review...\n\nWell, not to overcrowd this little spot which is usually busy enough, but I have to sing their praises a little bit. Blue Fin serves very good, healthful Japanese food and is run by some of the sweetest people you'll ever meet (thanks Howard and Betsy!)\n\nI've tried many things on the menu and it's all very tasty. However there's one dish that I always go back for and find myself craving - the white meat teriyaki chicken. Yes, I know, teriyaki is the most common Japanese dish in America, but Blue Fin's is simply awesome. \n\nMost restaurants serve teriyaki as chicken with commercially-made sauce squeezed on top. But Blue Fin marinates their chicken in a homemade teriyaki that's just incredible. It's a big serving and I rarely leave any on the plate. Order it with the salad and it's even better - the best asian salad dressing beside's flo's asian kitchen. And sprinkle on some of the spicy seasoning that's on the table, too. hard to beat it.\n\nOnly drawback lately is all the construction around the area, but hey that's downtown these days. And we're lucky Blue Fin is still there - the city had planned to buy and demolish the building, but customers put up such a fuss they decided to let them stay. Hurray for democracy! And hurray for Blue Fin!",3
"I come here once in a while. This place is a step up from Applebees but still lands on my mediocre list. \n\nThe menu is all over the place, I never know what to order. But, they do usually have deals such as 25$ for two. So you order 2 entrees that comes with an appetizer for 25$. Today that was not on the menu anymore. They did have a dinner one for $35 but I didn't really pay much mind to it. \n\nI've had few different items on their menu. One that I usually get is the Texas fries. It's basically loaded fries (cheese, jalape\u00f1os, and bacon). I have had their flat beard before which are pretty good. The beau usually gets their ribs which really aren't anything special. \n\nThey added these screens at each table. You can order your dessert, ask for a refill, look at the menu, play games (for 99cents each game), and pay your bill on. It's pretty neat because it even allows you to split the check and tells you how much to tip! \n\nFound out that all day Sunday is Happy Hour but only at the bar and we had already sat ourselves in the dinning area and ordered our foods. darn! They had some good discounts of food and drinks too! \n\nService is usually on the slower side. Today it was pretty fast surprisingly.",1

There is no haole inspired terriyaki chicken with pineapple at this place..true katsu, authentic short ribs, home made mac salad..and the portion size arein true hawaiian tradition...I have eaten here over a dozen times and the place is familly run..so you feel like you are going to a bbq at an aunties house rather than a formal dining place..which is awesome for family dinners with a 4yr old..the ladies that work the night shifts call my daughter by name and treat her like their own little neice..letting her order herself and occasionally getting a free ice cream if she is a good girl\nThe food here is not low-fat by any means..but if you want some amazing hawaiian comfort food here you go..this place is run laid-back island style..so go here to just cruise and relax not if your on a time schedule..this is not the place to get in and out for a quick bite..its a place to bring the whole ohana and talk story of some ono grinds...its a place to remember that a meal is a time to make memories and share family values while breaking bread..not a place to just feed your stomach when your hungry..i feel like I am back home in da islands everytime we come here\n\ngotta try the short-ribs\nmixed plate\nribeye steak\nkorean chicken katsu dip\nand the chantilly cake..omg\n\nnothing on this menu is small portioned or prepared wrong..you can tell the food is made with family love..so go enjoy some Aloha!!",4
"It seems like when this place gets a sick animal the first thing they do is push you off on someone else, they can't be bothered.  My Black Lab was mis diagnoised with thyroid cancer, they said it was a fat mass and wouldn't biopsy it, my yellow Lab swallowed something that got stuck in his intestines, they took blood work and said they would call in the morning.....I ran him right out to Cave Creek for an ultrasound, we were sent to a hospital a block away and took him in for emergency surgery, he would not have survived the night.  I believe if you dog needs only shots, your probably safe, anything else...run, run far away.  They don't care about your animals.  There are so many caring and outstanding vets who truly care about animals, get away from these people!!!",0
"Did we just get there TOO early or what?\n\nI heard good things about this and dragged my friends there after the buffet. It had 1 long table and some smaller ones on the other side. Where's the live music? \n\nNo one was at the front and when we walked in, there were about half dozen people drinking. No music, no service. Walked in and walked out.",0
"Came here the other night for the Christmas lights in the cactus garden and i will have to say i was impressed!  It was nice and empty since it was a Monday night, so we were able to enjoy the lights without being surrounded by a large crowd!  I highly suggest going to see the Christmas lights!  (Its free!!!)  The chocolate factory was also open when we were there, and the tour was open we well.  The tour is VERY short, maybe 50 yards, and will take only about 5 min. to walk through, and thats if you read all the signs.... BUT, they do give you a free sample at the end!  All in all, I would go for the Christmas lights... and thats about it!",2
"Great pho and noodle dishes.  The pho broth is very flavorful and perfectly seasoned.  The portions are large, with generous portions of noodle and meat.  Their vermicelli dishes are very good as well.  Prices are a little high, but are worth it for the quality of food.",3
"One of my longtime girlfriends generously treated me to lunch at Olives during our Vegas getaway. The restaurant was comfy, spacious and very posh. \n\nAn enormous bread basket kicked off our meal. It came with two types of olive tapenade and some oil-soaked olives. Very schmancy. For lunch, my friend had the scallops which were fantastic, while I had a Caesar salad with ahi tuna which was light enough for lunch but filling enough for someone who was out boozing until all hours the night before. \n\nAlthough we chose to sit indoors, the balcony tables had the advantage of misters and a stellar view of the Bellagio fountains. \n\nThe Stone Cold Fox also known as Todd English wasn't on the line, but I happily daydreamed about him waltzing through the dining room to greet us nonetheless.",3
"Went here to try them out after Sai Wan Bistro. Walked in to the store and there was no one in the store. No customers, no staff to be seen anywhere? Waited a couple of minutes and walked out. I'll bet the owner wonders why his business is in the toilet. As we left, we drove behind the building and the \""staff\"" was outside smoking and texting. To the Owner: Please notify the bankruptcy court of you soon to be filed application.",0
"Brilliant marketing scheme. ** Get the Total Rewards Membership card BEFORE you go to the buffet **  haha, we waited in line at Caesar's Lago awhile before we realized you can't sign up for the card AT the buffet. Fortunately my husband and I took turns jumping out of line and running over to the cashier to get our cards.  We didn't even realize we were already members from back in 2005 :)  It's definitely worth the price since it pays for itself in two meals. Only problem is we got a little tired of buffets after lunch at Lago, dinner at Spice Market and lunch at Rio the next day.  I would probably get it again and just use it for two dinner buffets if you get the timing right. I've reviewed the buffets individually, but in a nutshell: Lago has terrible reviews but, although small, I loved the food quality and ambiance and would go back... Spice Market has good variety and generally good taste but is loud and feels unfriendly and smoke wafts down from the casino... and finally, Rio had some bright spots but is kinda overrated if you ask me - too big, crowded, lesser quality food, poor ambiance.  I have eaten at the Paris buffet in the past and highly recommend it. I have never eaten at the Harrah's or Flamingo's buffets. I wish other properties would offer this deal (do they?).",4
"So it's clear that \""pig foot\"" sounds a lot sexier French. This place is absolutely gross in the best kind of way. The room is super cool, as it should be. Duluth is one of the classier alleyways in Montreal. The open kitchen offers most of the dining room a view of the black magic underway - who thought one would so enjoy watching a young chef make love to a pig carcass. \n\nI've been here more than once, please don't order this all in one sitting. The Foie Gras Poutine (the fries are cooked in duck fat) is as heavy as it sounds. However, at PDC, the server may suggest it as a light starter. The Duck in a Can is all things fat. When plated, you can watch the duck fat and other oils battling for room.The PDC Melting Pot is offers three cuts plus blood sausage over a cheesy potato concoction... at least I think there were potatoes in there.The Guinea Hen for 2 really feeds 5-6. The beef tartar and bison tongue are on par with everything else. The only dish I've had that I didn't enjoy was the PDC salad. Interestingly, our server warned me upon ordering. We've never had dessert, I don't know if they serve dessert, \n\nThis is not the best restaurant in Montreal, but its a damn good one. Also, make this the last stop of the night. The self loathing should set in as you slip into helplessly into a pork-coma.",3
"This place is why McDonald's is always an option.  Overpriced, small portions, gristly meat.  Zero stars but I have to give it one just to have this show up.\n\nI get it.  It's Vegas, I'm in a casino hotel, they have to soak me.  It's probably in the corporate charter: \""Overcharge on everything\"".  Still, if you're going to give me a place of shitty food, at least fill the plate.  The food costs perhaps a dollar to make per plate, maybe two.  In NYC you're out the door for six bucks with a can of Coke.\n\nNah, the place is a complete ripoff.  Do not go here.  Ever.",0
"Great food, TVs everywhere, service is alright. Overall a good place to watch a game and eat some bar grub.",3
"BEST SANDWICH EVER.\n\nCame here on a whim because I couldn't find pink's hot dogs, but I sooo do not regret this decision. Makes me want to get 10 sandwiches next time I'm in Vegas just so I can savor it. \n\nI had the caprese sandwich, and my friends had the hawaiian one with pineapple. While there's was tasty, mine was DELISH. The bread is perfect and toasted, and definitely hit the spot. Makes me drool just thinking about it.......",4
"Kunaffe!!!! Finally somewhere local to fill my random Mediterranean food and dessert cravings. Excellent food, everything is made fresh. Service is spectacular. Only thing I didn't like was the grape leaves. Sorry Duzan, nothing compares to my grandmother's. :0)\n\nGet the lemonade. And the pita. And the kunaffe.",4
"Huge portions, friendly staff, solid food and a decent bloody mary at a reasonable price.\n\nWe have been many times and tried many things.  If you are going for brunch, expect to wait.  As for food, we have tried pretty much everything and the best dish is likely the Sage Chicken Benedict.  The hash plates are solid and (being I like sweet breakfast) the french toast and pancakes are also good.\n\nGo to Hash House a GoGo for a large breakfast with a large bloody mary and expect to pay a very reasonable bill when you're done.  Is it the best breakfast ever?  no.  But you would have a hard time finding a better all around breakfast deal and if you go in with the right expectations, I'd be surprised if you didn't enjoy the meal.",2
"We enjoyed a homemade pizza with rapini and Tuscan sausage. Great thin crust and really fine flavor. Also, our salad had some of the best cucumbers we had ever tasted. The atmosphere is quite nice. Here are the drawbacks: the prices. As most have noted the prices are a bit high, but at least it's very good quality. Second: the service. While there were loads of servers in the dining room, it took nearly an epoch to get our check.",2
"I came here today to get a gel manicure and a regular pedicure. The gel manicure was \""ok\"" but nothing to rave about. Then I sat in the chair for my pedicure. A few things happened that left me VERY unhappy with my experience. 1) They started my pedicure, trimmed my nails, cuticles (which were very rough and hurt), etc. but DID NOT EVEN TOUCH THE BOTTOM OF MY FEET to get the dead skin off. When I told them they said \""yes we did\"" and that if I wanted all the dead skin off I would have to pay extra for a callus remover. 2) The guy stopped in the middle of the pedicure and walked away. I sat there for 10 minutes as they tended to other customers. 3) A different guy came back to give me my massage but only massaged my legs/calves for maybe 2-3 minutes total. They did not even massage my feet. 4) Then after the \""massage\"" they had a new person come to paint my nails. This is the first negative review I have ever put on Yelp, because I have never had an experience such as this at a nail salon. It is unfortunate because you spend the money on yourself to go and relax, and then you leave feeling like it was a waste! Do not go to this place, they are rude and don't know what they are doing! And by the way, I get my nails done 1-2 times a month so I know what to expect, and I do not have gross feet. The sounds of this review might make it seem that way since they barely did anything to my feet.!",0
"Been wanting to try Joyride Taco for a while now so took the opportunity to have lunch there.  Bottom line, definitely go for drinks if you're in the area but skip the food.\n\nJoyride and all the other restaurants in downtown Gilbert aren't easy to get to.  Traffic in the area is congested and parking is hard to find... unless you park a block west of everything and the walk from that parking lot is full of dirt/mud/holes/barriers to hurdle.\n\nThe place was about 1/4 full at 1pm on a weekday.  Service was great except for the person who dealt with us most - our waitress.  We waited ten minutes before our drink order was taken, water was never refilled and she left our bill when we weren't even done ordering.  Much of our service was done by other people, though, and they were better than great and phenomenally professional (except for their hiring ability, apparently).\n\nThey brought free chips and salsa, and the salsa was really good.  I'm still not sure about the chips because they seemed house made but were thick like store bought.  The drinks were downright amazing, great beer selection the the cocktails were perfectly balanced and just this side of too strong.  Yes.  I thought the liquor prices were very good for the quality.\n\nMy biggest memory of Joyride was the food, which was so boring.  Everything lacked flavor.  The pork tacos were juicy but had no flavor even with a squeeze of lime, and their tortillas were too soft and just fell apart upon pick-up.  They desperately needed something like cotija or a flavorful crema...salt, even.  The pinto beans were a joke.  No flavor again - they actually tasted just like the Ranch Style Beans my mom used to serve from the black can.  I saw some green flecks that looked like jalapeno but the taste was not there.  This bland food might pass in Chicago but not here.  blecch",1
"HUGE portions,awesome food...insanely high prices,but worth it if you gotta have REAL deli now and then.\n\nLove the pickles,the spicy mustard,the corned beef,the turkey,the knish!",3
I have been to Graze twice and I would go back again. Their menu is eclectic and varied and there are vegetarian options for me.\n\nThe portions are a bit small... I wish they were larger.,2
"Nice place to get away from the hustle and bustle.  The place is small but quaint.  I have been there for breakfast and lunch, both were good.  Breakfast you cannot go wrong with any omelette.  For lunch I had the salmon salad and it was delicious!  The staff is super friendly and it is usually never busy.",3
"Best buffet for the $ in Vegas!\n\nGreat selection of food from various regions of the world. Great service, and never too long of a wait. \n\nOnly suggestion might be to change up the offerings more often.",4
"Well... it was okay. I definitely had higher expectations for this place, but I'm not exactly sure why. Wahoo's is super cute, very clean and everyone was extremely friendly. I enjoyed the surf/skate motif and found it really visually appealing. I wasn't quite sure what to order, but I ended up with a shrimp soft taco and a Cajun grilled fish enchillada. It totaled just under $7. You basically place your order at the bar and then they give you a number placard and they'll bring it out to you. Self seating. \n\nThe restaurant was pretty empty, but it did seem to take awhile for the food to finally come out. It was good, very spicy and flavorful, but not very filling at all. The taco had a LOT of cabbage on it and was really small and difficult to pick up. I gave up trying and just ate it with a knife and fork. The enchillada was pretty good, but again on the small side.\n\nI guess Wahoo's is fine if you are craving Mexican and seafood in a nice atmosphere, but I just felt a little let down. I think I could have had a more satisfying meal elsewhere for the same amount.",2
"I came to this salon as a last resort before letting my nails go from the salon I just left across the street that butcher my nails. The lady here Lucy looked at my nails and said she will do what she can to fix his mess. Unfortantly I had to go really short but she did a great job, is very friendly, had conversation with me about my situation, talked to my kids. It's not the nicest looking place but if you ask for Lucy she does is a good job. I also noticed she greeted everyone that came in by name I have been looking for a place like this for a while. Since this is my first time here I only gave four stars but as I go back I will revise my rating.",3
"Place is good for fast food, Clean inside. Friendly staff",3
"Came here tonight with the kids -5 total people, food was amazing great taste, it came out rather fast and tasted fresh! Everything had a great flavor. We had Singapore rice noodles and they were amazing!! We each ordered one dish and have so much left over. The price for all 5 of us to eat was very fair in fact it is one of the cheaper dinners we have had!  Just because it was cheap does not mean they left out quality the quality was great and we can't wait to come back and try more items!",4
"I absolutely LOVE this place! Postino is my favorite wine bar in the East Valley. \n\nThe best nights to go are Monday and Tuesday nights to take advantage of their $20 house bottle of wine and board of bruschetta deal. The deal starts at 8pm but be prepared to wait about an hour for a table...it's definitely worth the wait! My favorite summer wine is the Biutiful Brut Rose which pairs well with the Brie & Apples with fig bruschetta. \n\nThe atmosphere is so classy, the staff is knowledgeable about the wines and the patio is inviting! I will definitely be a regular here!",4
I Have been there several Times when they first opened the food was good and nice portion for the money went back a couple days ago and the portion size has been cut in half and they must have a new chef because the food tasted Completely different if they want to stay open they have to be consistent,1
Lizzy is sensational! I began getting Brazilian and leg waxing over 3 years ago. I was very self-conscious & tried other technicians but am thrilled to find Lizzy. She is professional yet personable. Her expertise and perfectionism makes her exceptional. I drive over 45 minutes to get there even though there is a European Wax Center located 5 minutes from my home! Well worth it!,4
"3 1/2 star rating?! How much crack are you people smoking!? I will give you three (3) reasons this place sucks balls:\n\n-The whole point of an outlet is it to supply energy...none of your outlets do this..so what are they? Because, they certainly are not outlets. Three separate attempts in different walls (including a charge station proved fruitless. Sonofabitch!).\n\n-Your courtesy people transporters make the most annoying, continuous whirling beep. Jesus Christ why?! Its obnoxious, but it fits your airport well I guess.\n\n-Your employees are lifeless. I go in to get a protein bar, and the woman made 0% eye contact with me the entire time. When she said \""have a great day\"", she must have been talking to the magazine rack.\n\nYou get two stars, go sit in think time and figure out how to call and hire an electrician who can re-wire your outlets. ALL YOUR OUTLETS...LOL.\n\nGo sit in a corner somewhere and figure out how to properly run simple, basic crap. Like the people transporters...Get them to stop whirling like the Pope and Gandhi commandeered these vehicles, began grinding, and then left the alarm on demanding everyone watch them grind....\n\nAnd finally, sit in a corner and figure out how to stop hiring vegetables. Look for people who can have the potential to smirk at me. Just a smirk. I am asking....for just a smirk. I am not that ugly...I think.\n\nCharlotte....silly Charlotte.",1
"Vendredi 4 juillet 2014\n\nUn beau vendredi en route vers un 5 \u00e0 7 avec une de mes cavali\u00e8res de tango. Quoi de mieux chez Nyks Bistro. Ambiance tr\u00e8s bruyante, tr\u00e8s difficile de se parler en t\u00eate-\u00e0-t\u00eate, un service qui laisse \u00e0 d\u00e9sirer, on nous oubli facilement pendant un bout de temps (je n'\u00e9tais pas le seul \u00e0 pointer sur cet \u00e9l\u00e9ment durant la soir\u00e9e...). Ne demandez pas de cocktails trop complexes, ils n'ont pas ce qu'il faut pour le faire. Le nombre de verres bris\u00e9s par le barman est absolument impressionnant. On en compte facilement 5 aux 40 minutes ! Je commence donc avec un Pineau des Charentes sur glace. Le menu semble app\u00e9tissant mais toutefois une grande r\u00e9serve sur la suppos\u00e9e poutine au magret de canard. L'assiette arrive avec une cuisse de canard confit.... on est loin du magret. Il faut donc expliquer la diff\u00e9rence. Le canard confit est cuit dans son gras et ensuite r\u00f4ti. Il peut comporter n'importe quelle pi\u00e8ce mais en g\u00e9n\u00e9ral on confit une cuisse de canard. Le magret est une poitrine de canard bien gras servit en tranches ros\u00e9es et, en g\u00e9n\u00e9ral, pr\u00e9alablement po\u00eal\u00e9 ou saisi. Point !\n\nUne poutine au magret de canard doit donc \u00eatre servi avec un magret .....car manger une cuisse sur des frites en sauce c'est plus que d\u00e9cevant. Au go\u00fbt, c'est tr\u00e8s diff\u00e9rent, en texture c'est compl\u00e8tement le contraire. J'aurais voulu go\u00fbter un bon tartare de boeuf mais ils servent le tartare du moment : cette fois-ci le tartare de saumon, trop facile \u00e0 faire. On peut mal \u00e9valuer les comp\u00e9tences du chef. On en sort avec une facture assez sal\u00e9e pour une maigre sortie. L'endroit est tr\u00e8s bien d\u00e9cor\u00e9, tr\u00e8s bien situ\u00e9 en plein centre-ville mais le tout s'est r\u00e9v\u00e9l\u00e9 tr\u00e8s loin de toutes mes attentes.\n\nFriday july 4th 2014\n\nA nice friday on the road to a great after work time with one of my tango partners. Why not Nyks Bistro. The ambiance is loud and it's very hard to have a nice cosy conversation. You get forgotten from time to time by the waitress (i was not the only one pointing this out in the bistro). Don't ask for too complexe cocktails to prepare, they don't have what's needed. Broken glass very often by the barman, it's surprising, one every 8 minutes almost, it gets very irritating ! I start with a nice Pineau des Charentes on the rocks. The menu seems nice, I order a duck magret poutine. The plate arrives deceptively showing a duck leg as a basic confit. We are very far from the duck magret. The difference is not subtile. A confit is a piece of duck (usually the leg) cooked in duck fat then roasted, a magret is the duck's chest, very fat and rich, cooked in a pan or grilled and served in slices, medium-rare. That's it !\n\nA poutine with duck magret has to bserved the correct way....eating a leg on fries and sauce is more deceiving to your taste buds. to the taste it's completely different and to the texture, it's night and day. I would have loved to try a nice beef tartare but they only had the \""tartare of the moment\"": salmon tartare, too easy to do. You cannot evaluate the chef's hability that way. You come out of the place with a saltish taste on the bill for a small pleasure of the moment. The place is nicely decorated, very well situated downtown, but the ambiance is way far from I had in mind and what I was wainting for.",1
"I love sushi, and love a good restaurant with cool ambiance. Social House had that, but...I don't think I'd go back. I was with a group of girls and we sat outside (very cool). BUT, there were misters all around the walls, and even though it was warm out it was WAY too much. Sort of wet and hard to see, even the waiter said he wanted to turn them off but couldn't. (was this a line?) The sushi was good, but I've had good sushi in other places, too. Not inexpensive but what is in Vegas? Oh, and the portions were much smaller than the average sushi bar. The scallop nigiri was good, the rolls were okay. \n\nMaybe if they had turned the misters off earlier in the evening we would have relaxed and enjoyed dinner more...",2
"This Place deserves NO Stars at all. If you want bad service, a mediocre, or horrible car wash, damage to your car, and a long wait... This is the Car Wash for you!\n\nI've been to this car wash a handful of times... Each time I remember why I never want to go back!\n\nThe first time I visited this Fabulous Freddy's, was in 2003 when I had bought a Brand New, Ford Ranger Truck! After a few days of buying it, I decided to have it detailed. At first glance, the truck looked good. I drove off to my sisters store, and when I got back, I noticed soap suds filled half way in the entire bed of the truck. After a long argument with management, they re-washed it for free. \n\nThe next time I went there, I was driving a Ford Focus. I took it in, to have it detailed. I waited an hour, and watched every Hummer, BMW, Mercedes, and other Higher End cars who came after me, leave before me. I complained to a manager, and he assured me I'd be next. I watched the 3 guys working on cars finish, then one of them pulled in with a Ferrari, all three, started working on it. So I got irate with the manager. He told me, \""I can't force them to wash your car.\"" I threw a fit, & got my money back, with 2 free details for the future. I decided to drive home, detail it myself, and ironically never used my free details. Guess I never had 2 spare hours to wait, then go detail my car myself? \n\nThe last time I went there, was about a month ago. My wife purchased a Groupon for a $20.00 credit, we decided to upgrade it for a better wash, when we got there. They took our car, we went in to pay, only to find out they don't honor Groupon deals on the weekend! So, we paid for the wash. A week later, we noticed our antenna was gone, and there was a scratch, where a tool might have been used, to remove the antennae. They refused to accept blame. We not only had to buy a new antennae, but also have to pay to get the scratch fixed. We've had the car less than a year, and the first time I didn't wash the car myself. \n\nI don't really know why they're so busy all the time, but my lowest wait time was, 45 minutes. \n\nThe problems with this location starts from the management, and their lack of concern for customer satisfaction. All the way down to their lack of self respect for the job they do. \n\nI will NEVER return to this Fabulous Freddy's, if I ever return to any location ever again!",0
Heard good things about this place. All I can say is that this is a perfect candidate for Kitchen Nightmares. Bad service. Bad food. Only order pizza if you must eat here. 93 rating.,0
"The first time I ordered, there were no real problems, other than an extended wait, 30-40 minute delivery time was the estimate and it took about 50 minutes.  Not the end of the world.\n\nSecond time didn't go too well at all.  Ordered a pizza at 12:00 p.m. and was given an estimated wait of 30-40 minutes again.  At 1:08 I called because the pizza had still not arrived.  I was told that the delivery guy was walking out the door and there was an included coupon for a free large pizza next time.  Compensation made me feel better. About 1:30 p.m. delivery guy comes with pizza.  \n\nThird time around - taking down to 2 stars from 3.  Promised delivery time of 11:45.  Pizza delivered at 1:10 p.m. - COLD.  Had to call to find out where pizza deliver was at 12:15 and was told that they had 1 driver and a lot of orders so my order would be at least another 30 minutes, but they would refund my pizza charge.  Another 55 minutes later my pizza arrives, but is completely cold.  I think it was made at the promised time but not delivered for another hour and 25 minutes. \n\nOverall: C-\nOne decent order, two bad orders - hopefully I'll be able to give an updated review as we use them more!",1
"Having gone here only once so far, I did what I usually do at a new bakery: I get one of almost everything. I don't remember everything I got, but I will say what is still floating around in this goldfish brain of mine.\n\nThey had pecan and chocolate chip cookies they said were good sellers. I can see why. They weren't super moist, but they were pretty tasty. The \""apple turnover\"" was exactly what you'd expect. They had these little sponge-cake-filled-with-custard-bites which were not revolutionary but still fun to eat. A pretty apricot cookie had subtle but satisfying fruitiness mixed with a crunchy French cookie exterior. The chocolate croissant was... a decent chocolate croissant! The baguette had that satisfying artisan/\""authentic\"" look to it: hard exterior, particular cuts in the dough to make it rise a certain way, and give it that \""I want to eat it\"" look.\n\nAs for their sandwiches - just don't. You're buying about $7-8 worth of bread with a dismal amount of ingredients inside. Just don't. Go next door to Paymon's if you're hungry.\n\nAlthough, not the absolute best, but definitely a step above most bakeries - and that is refreshing. They seem to really be trying. One detail that really stood out about the pastries was that none were too sweet - at all! Huge points for this. I'll definitely be back here to give a more thorough review as they develop more as well.",2
"This place is awesome! I finally checked it out today, and now that I have a job in the area, I think I will become a frequent visitor. My dining partner and I each chose a beer from the great tap selection. They have a lot of unique taps, things that you don't see everywhere. I chose the Fox Barrel Pear Cider. I am somewhat of a hard cider snob, and so many places just play it safe and have Angry Orchard or Woodchuck on tap. I love that they have something a little different for us cider drinkers. My dining partner chose a Belgian beer, of which they have many, and he really enjoyed it as well.\nWe weren't planning on eating, but after seeing the food menu, we had to try something. I was really impressed with the different ingredients they use and the choices in local products. We chose the bruschetta, which was delicious. It was like a caprese salad on slightly toasted bread. It was slightly expensive, at $10 for three medium sized pieces, but it was very tasty.\nThe service was great, too. I'm guessing our server was the owner, and he was handling the dining room and bar almost entirely on his own. The service wasn't slow at all... we barely had to wait for service, our drinks, or our bill. He was holding his own, for sure!\nWe will definitely be back to this place. I'm thinking next time we will try some more of the food, maybe get a full dinner. I would highly recommend this place.",4
"I would really like to say 5 whole stars and for effort, they are easily 5 stars of nice here, but overall, there was a few issues.\n\nThe chicken was really FREAKING good, like go there to eat it, forget about the karaoke good.\n\nHowever, we came to sing, and sing we did.  Well, kinda. The equipment kept getting wonky, and the song selection was whack, you can see clearly the other Yelpers that were there with me, and the only difference I think was my heavy interaction with the staff, and all of that was top notch.\n\nOverall, I had a good time and they really did go above and beyond for us and the atmosphere there was a fun party (WOOO HOOO that hot 'Paul Pope' style art in the bathroom was nice) and open so late that well, try it and order the chicken but don't go expecting the nicest set up and song selection and I think you'll be pleased.",3
"The Bistro is one of my favorite places to eat in Boulder! Passing through last week we stopped in for lunch. The menu had a great variety of sandwiches and the ones we tried were superb!!! But the rating of the 2 stars was giving because the service was poor and deeply disappointing :(  Putting it nicely, the waitresses mood was unpleasant. She was tired and slow, we've never had lunch take so long. The Bistro should really seek someone who knows their job and how to provide \""good service\"" to their customers like we've had in the past dining with them. It is such a shame for us to say that our experience with lunch at The Bistro was such a flop!",1
"Probably the best happy hour in town -  I always enjoy this place. Service quality and prices are amazing. The only place in town to get a quality draft beer without getting ripped off. Great! Plus, you can always find parking close by.",4
"I've had a lot of Greek food in Charlotte and the surrounding area, and none of it has been good, until this place. Just the other day we gave Greek Isles one last try, and our meal was still only partially decent (we won't go back again). But then my fiance brought home some spanakopita, gyros, and a salad from The Mad Greek, and it was all terrific! Best spanakopita I've ever had- I can't stand dirty-tasting cooked spinach, and there isn't a bit of that taste in theirs! Not a ton of feta in it, but just enough nice sized chunks, along with a good garlic flavor. Even tasty the next day! The greek salad was perfect- feta was very tasty (huge feta fan, have had many, this one was great!), the dressing wasn't sweet (thankfully!), but it wasn't too tangy either. The boy said it was the best gyro he'd ever had. We will definitely be back again!",4
"Been in here a couple times to day drink. Went in there last night with a couple friends around 1030, sat down at a table and apparently we were weren't good enough to be customers. No one acknowledged us/served us/or even said hi. We had to walk up to the bar which was in plain view from our table, to get menus, then waited another ten minutes. Still didn't even get a \""we'll be right with you\"" so we left. Sent an email to their manager no reply so far, so we'll see what happens. Maybe I can call corporate about it. \nOh and the one star is for the actual place. Cool place, nice setup, but you can see how a couple amateur employees can ruin potential business.",0
"I love F&E, but this location needs to work a little bit on their customer service. Usually, I walk in, and the workers don't greet me. So, I greet them. I went in yesterday, and I said bye to the workers, and was ignored again. What is that all about? When I ask about their products, nobody knows. I asked if their non-organic produce has pesticides or GMO's and they told me something like, the owner says you will be fine if you get non-organic bananas. Another employee said something like, I don't know, but I wouldn't eat the non-organic produce. So, although their customer service needs a little work, and although my questions weren't answered, I love F&E! They have great deals on certain items, they are very close to my house, and they have a lot of reasonably priced organic items!",3
Great little spot and delicious Arizona Mules! :)  There is also a back room that has skeeball and shuffleboard.  It's fun to play against new friends and the loser gets to buy a round of shots!,3
"The food is consistently good and the zax sauce is awesome.\n\nThe chicken tenders are kinda small but they make up with it in quantity and lots of sides. \n\nAlso, the drive thru isn't the quickest.",3
"Food:  ok but too salty\nEnvironment : clean and open kitchen\nService: servers are nice but we have to constantly ask for things.  We have 6 people and was given 3 napkins and 4 spoons.  \nAlthough we have 6 and service was just ok, we were charged 18% gratuity.  Not happy about this. \nConclusion:  so many pho restaurants nearby. I definitely won't come back.",1
I highly do no recommend this place. I am sure the doctor is great but the prices were out of control. I was quoted close to $500 for a new set of lenses on one pair of glasses. She made up some bogus remark that the mounting position made it more expensive. I went down the street to Las Vegas Optometry Care and paid $475 for the same lenses and a brand new pair of sunglasses with prescription. Erika definitely had a better selection but the price was ridiculous.,0
3* for the service 31/2* for the food 5* for using fresh ingredients but it wouldn't kill you to make it taste good.,2
"Very rude caucasian salesman ! I'm hispanic So I walk in the lady at desk doesn't say Hi another African American lady sees me and doesn't say Hi! So I'm already walked like 1/3 of the mall. So the man goes ( mind you doesn't say Hi) do you know our policy? and I say what? He's goes no back packs! I say it's my purse small pack , the ladies didn't say anything about my bag when I walked in .I go do you want to check it? He's goes on the way out!! Mind you other women with bigger purses in there Caucasian ladies , I wonder if he said anything to them. Well he ruined my shopping experience , I was gonna buy something but I didn't . Just wonder if the guy was prejudice , thinking I was gonna steal? Because I'm Hispanic??",0
"The food here is close to 4 stars.  For the food you get, I feel the prices are reasonable.  So with that being said why 2 stars???\n\nClearly the SERVICE, it is one of the wrost in this town, unless you are out for at least a 2 hour ONE course meal.  Really????\n\nThis has been the case the last few times we went.  So why go back?  It is close to home and I thought they might have it figured out...NOPE...\n\nWhy would you have 2 people to handle the front door and ONLY ONE Waiter to take care of tables????  Why have 3 runners and only one waiter???  This place has been understaffed for a long time and I just don't understand the logic.  It is not that hard to have 2 full time waiters.\n\nWe went last night, we were seated and told our waiter was Mark.  Close to 10 minutes LITERALLY, before he came over and asked for a drink order.  Two drinks came and away he went, no ask of an appetizer, nothing.  Another person came and ordered an Iced Tea and a hot tea was ordered as well.  LITERALLY FIVE minutes to get the teas.  Finally an ask was made for appetizers and one ordered along with the food.\n\nThe appetizer came and was eaten very very slowly and aboiut the time we finished eating it, the food came. \n\nNOW, in the defense of the restaurant, the food ordered did take some time to prepare and was prepared with quality, care and appreciation for what was being served.  A request was made for more hot tea which took the 5 minute waiting game again.  Once we were done, the plates were removed from the table in record speed...why can't accompish this with drinks and refills??\n\nWe did not want desert, we asked for the left overs to be placed in seperate bags as we were going in two directions.  So do you think the SAME guy who took the plates remembered who got what left overs???  NO, this morning it was discovered this task, which was only 3 plates was WAY ABOVE the level of competence of the guy who took the plates.\n\nWe asked for our bill and then watched the waiter run around, do several other things and pass our table several times before he finally came back and gave us our bill.  This whole process of getting the bill, 10 mintues...Needless to say we paid cash as we did not want to wait for him to take the card and never come back even though at this point we were one of ONLY 4 tables in the place.  \n\nHe is a nice guy, but handling more then two 4 tops for him at a time, not a good idea...if you are going to keep the doors open to a certain time and have 2 people at the door, 3 runners including the manager, more then one server would be a good idea.\n\nI believe we are done with this place unless we come across a day that we can spend 3 hours in a place to get a salad and a meal.  There are places in town with comparable prices if not better, with comparable food if not better and service that will BLOW THiS PLACE AWAY....",1

"The food was nothing more than mediocre for the price. Mediocre ribs (on the dry side), ginormous portions, and big prices to match. Tastes like a chain! And you pay for the theme.\n\nCan be decent for a gathering of the masses to watch a game, or a large party. Otherwise, I'd pass.",1
"Soul is unique with some good/interesting food options.  I wish I had a drink here, as they all looked great, but I had plenty the day before, so I wasn't feeling up to it.  I even saw Bob the Bartender slinging drinks from behind the bar, so that is always a great sign.\n\nWe tried to go here a number of times, but the place is small, there is always a long wait, so get there early, (i.e. before dinner time) if you want to sit immediately.\n\nI started off with the Pork Belly Tacos, and they were amazing.  I would suggest splitting these, though, as they get heavy on your stomach pretty quick.  Especially if you are going to sample other menu items.\n\nThe fried cheese was also great.  I ended up just eating by itself, rather than on the bread.\n\nThe service was slightly below average, as it seems like they serve their food in batches (e.g. they make a large batch of pork bell tacos and everyone gets it at the same time regardless of when you ordered), and our server was mostly absent.\n\nThe big down sides are 1) getting a seat, and 2) sitting on the lap of absolute strangers once you do get a seat.  I really hate cramped seating, so next time I would try and get their 1-2 booths that have.\n\nI would love to come back here for some drinks, but I would target an afternoon or an off peak time.",2
"I should have read Alexander's Yelp review before I ventured out of my La Quinta hotel during my business trip.  But we went here for a quick dinner and although their fried ice cream was pretty above average, it couldn't equal out for their horrendous spinach enchiladas.  Everything was mushy tasting and their white sauce topping on the enchiladas looked like that kind of cheesy topping that is microwaved from 3 days ago.  Hal-O-Peno's is a nice pun but doesn't qualify as being a good quality Mexican establishment.  Keep walking down the street to find better food.  This is the second Yelp \""warning.\""",0

I couldn't believe I spent $70 for one albacore nigiri,  one hotate nigiri, and 4 paper thin slices of chutoro that I couldn't even taste, oh yea and that groose kinako tiramisu which the waiter recommended.  I don't mind spending money on good food but this place was a joke.\n\nI would not come here again. What a waste of money, good thing it wasn't my money....",0

"I feel like I went camping. I don't know where to start!\n\nMy first room was infested with crickets. Noisy chirping crickets. I got moved across the property to another room (prepare to walk!). The room looked like it hadn't been occupied in a while. Within 5 minutes I captured 3 moths. The toilet seat was broken and the sink drain lever was broken too. I'm sure this hotel is a woman's dream...NOT!\n\nThe rooms here are nothing like I expected. I've worked and lived in Scottsdale on and off for 10 years, so I had relatively high expectations for this hotel & the rooms. My carpet was old and you could see the base boards since they didn't cut the carpet to fit the room. The decor is awful unless you are born pre-1950. The bathroom is spacious and somewhat remodeled - although the shower is tiny and the tub is 1/3 the depth of a normal hotel tub. The sheets were marked up and overall this place just felt dirty. I felt like I was staying in a two star motel. \n\nI'm glad I wasn't paying for this hotel or I would have instantly booked a room elsewhere. The Royal Palms down the street is much nicer!!",0
"Cafe Rio is everywhere in the valley.  Place is known for their Pork Barbacoa, but I don't prefer pork so I couldn't start my review on how great that was.  \n\nWhat I can comment on..\n-Nachos:  Missing San Diego, I had them create nachos with just sour cream, double chicken, and cheese.  I have to say, one of the best 2000 calories i consumed in one time in a along time.\n\n-Burritos:  Kept it simple again.  Just the chicken and rice.  I'm not really into the messy wet burritio so I had them just add a small amount.  \n\nPortions are huge and the meals are delicious.  Service is a quick cafeteria/assembly line type ordering. I like it.  At least you can see exactly how your food is being prepared. \n\nTIP:  Get your side sauces before you pay or while you are ordering.  They never ask if you need any and there isn't any in the condiment area or tables.",3
"Despite some of the other mostly lukewarm reviews (which usually impact our decision to try a new restaurant), we decided to brave it. \n\nAfter a short 30-minute wait (not bad for a busy Saturday night) we were seated and served drinks promptly. I ordered the first Cabernet on the menu and  (recommended by our uber-cool waiter Gavin) and it was good...in fact they do a pretty good pour. \n\nThe interior looks completely different from the 98 South days, but is still really cool with murals of a \""downtown Chandler circa early 1900's with a bit of contemporary flair.\"" There is outside patio seating which is fantastic on a spring night. \n\nWhile many were dressed casually (shorts and golf shirts), this isn't a pub or bar atmosphere. I'd recommend it for a date night or pseudo-nice evening out so dress comfortably but not flip-flops and ripped jeans.\n\nI'm sure the place is fine with kids, but I'd recommend against bringing them unless they're really well-behaved since there's a lot of hustle and bustle. \n\nThe bread was warm and fresh.Our salads were also fresh and uncomplicated, and the wasabi cream dressing was really flavorful.\n\nI ordered the filet mignon and my hubby ordered the pike...they were both cooked to order, had great flavor and very tasty! They must have listened to some of the reviews and gotten it together because everything from the service, ambience, apps and entrees were great! \n\nThe prices were really reasonable ($24 for a 9 oz. filet, with bread, salad and baked potato.) \n\nUnfortunately we were too full to handle dessert, but we'll definitely be back to try that too.\n\nI'd actually rate DC Steak House 4.5 stars if I could, but Yelp doesn't have that as an option.)\n\nI recommend you check it out and see for yourself!!",3
"We stumbled on this gem when looking for the Linq. It's a cute store, the staff is very friendly and helpful, they know the products well. I don't like frozen drinks, alcoholic or non alcoholic. I like my drinks over ice. So I didn't buy anything. I don't want to use the word pushy but the girls were very all over you wanting to know if you want to buy something. I think it's called suggestive selling. I'm sure they have performance goals to meet. Sweet girls but all they have are slushie drinks and I don't care for slushie type drinks. I would still check out their merchandise and candy.",3
"As others have mentioned the d\u00e9cor here is all Steampunk, which in all honesty. . . really isn't my thing. However, we were in Vegas and looking for something a bit out of our comfort zone. \n\nWe made an online reservation via OpenTable and had no issues with seating or adding another person a couple hours before our Saturday reservation at 7pm. We were seated in the front of their restaurant at a very large table. Each of the chairs were unique, padded and dramatic. \n\nThe menu situation was a bit weird as you look at drinks on an iPad, but don't order from them and then dinner is on a regular paper menu. Maybe this is a new technology they are working in but not quite done with yet? Drinks all sounded very interesting, they even have a \""Potion Cart\"" as I have deemed it, where a woman will come to your table and create a concoction of your choosing in front of you. The drinks all included specific bitters and ingredients, that in my opinion didn't drink well. \n\nThe food items were all very interesting takes on comfort food items like chicken pot pie bites or inside out french onion grilled cheese. Again, in my opinion, I felt each of these missed the mark. Whether it was missing an item or overly greasy. As to be expected, items were also expensive and small.\n\nService however was stellar, very friendly, prompt and patient with our slightly tipsy table.",1
"The food is good here, quite good actually. I give it two stars because it is far too expensive for what it is. I speculate that the high prices are to cover the overhead on the large (in sq. ft.) restaurant area, or maybe they use really high-quality ingredients in some dishes and spread the cost of those over their cheaper dishes. I say this b/c I have only gotten pretty simple stuff like pad thai, tom ka, and curries from them (no fancy fish or meat) and have always felt that I overpaid by at least 50%. \n\nIMHO, Nothing about this place justifies the excessive prices (though the dope mural outside comes close). The quality of the food is about on par with or slightly higher than Thara Thai, but the prices are nearly double.",1
"Invited friends to dinner and drinks there, as we had been there before and enjoyed the experience.  This time, not so much. Arrived with a party of four, and was seated at a table that was too close to the next table on one side (making it hard to get in and out of our seats)' the other side backed to the walkway to the kitchen, making our guest uncomfortable with all the traffic behind them. This was done, even though there were at least 5 or 6 open tables that did not have this issue.\n\nThe appetizers were delivered promptly and were good quality (meat and cheese board with olives) though a bit pricey.  Drinks were ordered, and when I ordered ice tea, was told that they charge for EACH GLASS. I asked about this and was given a lame excuse by the waitress that it is because they brew it by the glass. Later when the Manager delivered some of the food, I questioned this policy stating that this was the only place in AZ that I knew that charged for ice tea by the glass. She gave the same reason and when I stated that it surely did not cost $2.50 to brew more tea, she got defensive and said that \""This is A WINE BAR YOU KNOW\"" \""We don't sell much ice tea.\"" I replied \""No doubt at those prices\"" and asked if she ever heard of the \""Designated Driver\"" that could should not be drinking. She gave no reply and left.\n\nThe food was only fair, I had the shrimp in pasta and cream sauce. The shrimp were large, but the pasta was too dry with only a coating of sauce.  My wife (a vegetarian) ordered the Mac and Cheese and the arugula orange salad. The salad was nothing special. Unfortunately, the Mac and cheese had ham in it, even though it is not listed on the menu. Thus, half of her dinner could not be eaten by her. I tried it. The Mac and cheese was bland with little flavor and again, way too dry.\n\nWhile our friends did not have any issues, they only ate half their meals. Probably too polite to express disappointment to us on our pick for dinner.\n\nThe service  was not timely, had to ask twice for water, because the server forgot, she even stated when asked for the second time, \""Oh I did not know you wanted water\""\n\nAll in all, mediocre and way too pricey for what you get. Probably ok if all you want to do is drink wine and an appetizers, don't bother for dinner.  Was hoping it would be better, but either the Living Room or Postinos have much better service and food for the same cost.",1
After a long day of driving I was so hoping the 4 star reviews would not steer me wrong.  From rice and beans to burrito or tacos the food was bland or over spiced that you could not tolerate the taste. Skip if you have a choice.,0
"Las Vegas is not a walking city.  The hotels are far apart.  The suburbs have strip malls.  The heat in summer (and the cold in winter) makes much of the year unpleasant outdoors.  But in the spring and fall we can have some absolutely gorgeous days.  Last night was a beautiful warm spring evening.  It was not windy and the clouds overhead were spectacular.  This was the perfect time for dining al fresco and what better meal to have than something Italian.  A friend of ours who works at UNLV suggested this new restaurant in Town Square.  Although we have been to Town Square several times (and visit Fry's next door regularly), we had not tried this restaurant.\n\nWe were seated on the outdoor patio promptly and ordered the carpaccio which was recommended by our friend.  I'm glad we did as it was delicious.  I decided on the lobster risotto and my husband had the Veal Milanese both accompanied by a lovely Italian white wine.  There was plenty of lobster and asparagus in my risotto.  My husband's veal was tender with just enough capers and lemon butter to flavor it, but not to make it soggy.  I am not much of a dessert person, so we skipped it.  Sipping the last of our wine while the the sky grew dark was the perfect end to a beautiful day.  We will be back.",3

"I recently came into Pritchett Eye Care Associates for the first time for an annual checkup. I live nearby and wanted to consolidate my doctors to all by nearby to minimize driving around town. I was a little reluctant to go someplace new because I hadn't yet heard anything about this establishment, but I was very pleased with my decision to change to this location. \n\nFirst off, the location is excellent for those who live in the Summerlin area. It is easy to find and easy to get in and out of. Next, the office itself is very attractive with nice displays for the glasses and a comfortable, clean atmosphere for waiting. Each person I spoke with was truly friendly, and I waited less than 5 minutes including new patient paper work. \n\nThe only doctor at this practice, Andrea Radtke, is as professional and polite as they come. She was very friendly and seems genuinely interested in getting to know her patients and make them feel welcome. Eye exams are never enjoyable, but I found that this visit flew by and was the least invasive and easy exam I've ever been through. Even though my appointment was at the end of the day, I never felt rushed or hurried as though they were waiting for me to leave to close. \n\nI also perused the sunglasses selection for quite some time and felt no pressure to be up-sold or add extraneous items to my purchase. I actually ended up not purchasing any during my visit, and they were gracious enough to keep a record of what I looked at and like and kept it in my file for the future in case I change my mind. \n\nTo say I was impressed was an understatement, and I will no longer avoid my annual visit like the plague! I highly recommend Pritchett and Dr. Radtke to anyone, especially those in the Summerlin area. I am confident your experience will be analogous to mine, and you will become a repeat customer as well.",4
"Great place, second time here and I must say it was much better than the first time. We had a fee plates to share, not on the all you can eat but just a share everything type of meal. The squid is the best, love it and can't stop eating it. We also tried the Aubergine and cucumber salad as they got rave reviews but both are nothing to shoot about and wouldn't get them again. The chicken wings are delicious, I am addicted to chicken wings so these met my craving :). We also shared a chow mein and some dim sum. The three of us left satisfied but not too full and didn't feel like we have anything unhealthy, greasy or heavy. The service was good and it was full to the last table, service was attentive and friendly but the waitress didn't understand us and it took some time to order. The only reason i haven't given 5 stars is the lack of main meal dish variety and the portion size is small. I look forward to going back.",3
"Great atmosphere for a DD.  Service and coffee is still top notch.  Clean and family friendly.\n\nMost importantly, if you're on the go, they have a couple of speedster checkout cashiers.  Bonus, their to-go lids are probably the best designed of all coffee shops.",3
"Had a few minutes before a flight out of a D gate and was starving from missing lunch so stopped by here to grab a jerk chicken bowl to go. What a mess! First, the order plus a bottle of water added up to $20. I expect airport prices to be high, so I just crossed my fingers that the food was actually palatable. Every single ingredient in the dish was bland--the chicken, the vegetables, the sauces they smothered everything in--and the rice and beans were an overcooked mush. I couldn't even finish it. Never again.",0

This is my favorite restaurant in Vegas. The crab cakes are to die for. You MUST get them. Also a must are the stone crabs. I don't usually like cold crab but these are succulent. The sauce they serve to dip them in is amazing.,4
"Noticed this place couple weeks ago while i was walking my dog and thought it looked interesting but never had the pleasure to try their ice cream until yesterday when i received coupon in the mail.\n\nI had a  coupon for buy one get one free. I ordered large size to go in with the coupon I received another large size for free. Large size included three scoops of either ice cream or gelato. I ordered strawberry, chocolate, coconut sherbet, and coffee gelato. Strawberry was more on the sour side then creamy, but it was still delicious. Chocolate ice cream was very chocolatey. Coffee gelato was A OK.\n\nOverall, we were satisfied with their quality of ice cream and gelato. We will return especially its in walking distance from our home.",4
Food is always good although the service could be better and seating is limited.  I prefer the truck.,3
"Wow. Just wow. I am amazed at how much Morton's has changed. I hadn't eaten at Morton's for years, so seeing it was apart of Restaurant Week 2013 it seemed like a good time to go back. Too bad we couldn't go back in time to when I remember Morton's being an excellent place to eat!. \n\nI made the reservation a few days before, but after arriving I don't think that reservation would have mattered because they were not busy at all and the bar was dead. They did have a menu board after you walk inside promoting Restaurant Week and the RW menu they were offering. After being seated in a comfy booth, a gentleman came over to take our drink order and inform us that he was glad we were seated away from the construction dust. Say what?!?! He said they were doing some remodeling and we got lucky seats. Gee thanks... Not! I wasn't prepared to start off the evening hearing about that and feel he should have kept it to himself. Some things you just don't relay back to the customers.\n\nOur server, Jessie, was attentive checking on us often and never letting our drinks get half empty. Jessie went over the RW menu with us and answered any questions we had. A large \""Onion Loaf\"" was brought to the table with some whipped butter. This is a big loaf! I thought it was good, but seriously it tasted like the onion bun on the beef n cheddar at Arby's. For the RW menu the price was $50.13 per person. For the first course I chose the \""Chopped Salad\"" and I have to say this was the one thing I really enjoyed. The chunks of blue cheese were amazing! I loved having such good sized chunks of blue cheese throughout the salad. The extra fresh cracked pepper I requested was nice too. For the 2nd course, I chose the 8oz filet well-done. Yep, I ordered a steak well-done! Get over it, it's MY steak! The filet is a thicker cut of meat, so when cooked properly it can still melt in your mouth even well-done! This was the first time in my entire life that I have ordered a well-done filet that didn't need to be butterflied. The steak lacked flavor and certainly didn't melt in my mouth. Even the crispy parts lacked flavor! I don't know if Morton's is being cheap with the RW menu, or if they really have gone downhill, but this steak isn't anything close to what I have had here in the past. \n\nYou can clearly see by the RW pictures posted and other pictures posted that Morton's slims down the portion size on some dishes when you order from RW menu. Tsk Tsk! The sides hubby and I chose (came with the 2nd course) were the \""Sour Cream Mashed Potatoes\"" and \""Lyonnaise Potatoes\"" since we weren't fond of the other options. The mashed potatoes were creamy yet had soft chunks of potato in it too. I thought the mashed potatoes were actually decent. The lyonnaise potatoes on the other hand were terrible. The pictures of previous yelpers lyonnaise potatoes looks different from what we got. First off the onions were chewy and nasty. Eating the onions was like chewing on grass. Gross! The potatoes were straight up french fries! This dish was a fail.\n\nSo it came time for dessert and I knew I wanted the \""Key Lime Pie\"" I just didn't know it would also be a fail. Key lime pie is one of my favorites (had the worst before this occasion in Florida believe it or not!) and I didn't think Morton's would be the worst ever key lime pie I have eaten. As it was placed in front of me, I could smell some fresh lime and grew excited. Pffft the only thing \""lime\"" about this pie was the few lime zests they scattered on top. That was the smell, just some lime zest. This pie had no tartness at all! It was just bland and like eating nothing. I did not finish it since it bored and disappointed me. \n\nI started eating at The Mint, or today known as top of Binions, Hugo's Cellar, etc. at a very young age. My parents taught us how to have manners and how privileged it was for someone of our age to be eating in a place like that. To this day we still eat at those places and have the same exact manners. Unfortunately, somewhere along the way rules changed because there were 2 others tables seated near us about half way through our meal. At one table there was a guy wearing light colored jeans and a baseball cap. At the other there was a boy, maybe 6 or 7, making loud sounds, running around the table in circles waving his arms in the air, and the father laughing and encouraging it. I remember when if your jeans weren't dark enough you weren't allowed to dine. A baseball cap is just disrespectful, and the kid running around with no control isn't just the parents fault, but Morton's too. Like I mentioned earlier, the place wasn't very busy and this kid and his noises were obvious enough that someone at Morton's should have said something. They would have when I was younger so what has changed now? I am not paying a good chunk of change to have that going on around me. Because of yelps character limit, Morton's should be glad I can't comment any further! :)",0
"Before seeing O, I was fortunate enough to see Believe as well.  Two Cirque shows in the same night was quite a treat.  I had high expectations for this show and low expectations for Believe; such expectations can come back to haunt you, both good and bad.\n\nFor O, I was, in the end, dissapointed.  I loved the show overall, the acrobatics, the enormous stage and the comedy performed on stage (or in water).  It was a great show. \n\nThere were very impressive scenes and costumes, but the lack of any sort of plot bothered me (and reduced the star).  I guess the plot could be that of reading a children's storybook.  There is one reference to the cow jumping over the moon that comes out of no where.  And that's just it: stuff comes out of nowhere and while visually stunning and entertaining, never ties into the next scene.  Criss Angel's Believe, while inferior but not really comparable to O, did have an overall plot that was difficult but followable.\n\nBut who am I to judge.  This show has been here for a long time and sells out every night, right?  I was lucky enough, again, to sit only 15 rows up and dead center.  Would I pay to see this again (about $160 a pop)? No.  If I paid anything cheaper I'd be in the balcony and not get the same experience.  However good a show is, if I can enjoy it just as much in the back as I could in the front, that is my idea of a 5 star show.",3
"If I could give less than one star, I would. The staff was rude and uninterested in any of the 10 people waiting to be seen.  I waited an hour and 45 minutes before being being taken back to the exam room, but in all fairness, they did squeeze me in last minute. I don't mind waiting, but when I did see the doctor (after 35 minutes more of waiting in the exam room), he wouldn't perform the cyst injection that I specifically called and asked if he would perform before going in. He said \""the front desk doesn't always have the right answer\"". They refunded my payment, but wasted most of my day. I also think it's bad form to blame your staff. The person I spoke with on the phone said she asked him (while I was on hold) if he would perform the injection and he said yes - whether that's true or not, I don't know. Either way, I'd avoid this place!",0
"Gorgeous, gorgeous ballpark. If you are a baseball fan, I don't care where you live, get your arse to PNC Park. \n\nEverything about this park, except for the team (no offense, Bucs fans), is top notch. The park itself has a very cozy feel to it and offers a great view of the city. The food is excellent and there's a ton of variety. You can get really great seats for an affordable price. Plus, I don't know if you non-Pittsburgh residents (such as myself) know this, but Pittsburgh is actually a pretty clean city and a lot of fun.\n\nI think I might like this better than Camden Yards, actually. Definitely a must-see for any baseball fan.",4
"This place doesn't deserve even one star. I am here right now. First of all, we order alfaker double apple with mint and it came with full mint itself. We asked them to remake it and it took them 40 mins to make a new head. The store manager came up and said it is full capacity. WTF, if they can't handle the full capacity, why do they accept the customer until it gets full??? Good interior design doesn't make a good store. What kind of service they provide makes a good one. I don't recommend this place. Very disappointed.",0
"Went here for lunch the other day...zowie! what a great place. Minute I walked in I was impressed as I have a liking for rich dark woods. Great looking place. \n\nhad a seat in a big fat booth and server Kelly was over in a flash to greet us and asking what we would like to drink. I thought it was great how she explained in detail that all the juice drinks are made from fresh to order from freshly squeezed juices- WOW Are you kidding me?!?! My wife ordered a fresh squeezed lemonade and it was awesome she said. I told Kelly I wanted a glass of white wine and unlike seemi9ngly most servers these days, she guided me through the labyrinth of wines to exactly what was going to turn me on. That was artful service and it didn't stop there either.  \n\nWe asked her for some appetizer selections and she explained many in great detail. We selected the Spinach and Artichoke Dip with Crostinis that was really very good - rich and creamy with large pieces of spinach (I hate when they are all diced). I ordered 4 oysters on teh half shell. Kelly brought them to the table and pointed and explained each oyster and wher it was originated: malpeque Oyster, Blue Point Oyster, Hama Hama Toyer, Gold Creek oyster. My favorite was the Blue Point. They were served with cocktail sauce and horseradish traditionally; however, it also came with if I can recall correctly was a Chardonnay infused oil or something that was outstanding to pare with the oysters. \n\nMy wife has Chicken Alfredo pasta - yea she did. A bountiful splendor of  treasures form the grotto of the sea and she orders chicken. Each there own I guess but I'm not going to expand on her selection - it was chicken. \n\nThis menu was so thick with things for me to order I just couldn't decide so I asked my server Kelly to choose for me and she hit it right on the mark with the Albacore Tuna sesame crusted with a Thai Chiki sauce. Outstanding hunk of fish and cooked absolutely perfectly - BRAVO! It was served with a nice Juliane of vegetables. My only issue here was the unsuspected slice of ginger hidden in there that I unsuspected ate and really hate. \n\nGreat experience and outstanding service - top notch and remarkably affordable. There was so much to choose from and our server also explained that the menu changes TWICE a day - yes TWICE a day. Only thing I was out of the ordinary was a \""10 UNDER $10 SPECIALS\"" list I guess for the penny pinching pamelas in the crowd - really seems your selling yourselves short there at the price point with  this quality, location, product and ambiance.",4
Great prime rib for the price. Good house beer,3
"We shared a sandwich and a huge piece of cake. Really good pastrami and chocolate fudge cake. Not NY, but very close! I'm happy! This is a great place to go for pastrami!",3
"Love this place! Every time we come in the owners are so kind and welcoming, not to mention the good is amazing!",4
"I am incredibly excited to have discovered this place. I've spent years searching the valley for what I considered to be \""coastal state grade\"" sushi, and I believe I've found it. The quality of the fish  that is served in the sushi is incredible. It actually has some structural integrity!! For those of you who eat sushi, you know what I mean. This stuff isn't slimy at all. It is extremely fresh! They also have some pretty incredible beers available. I was stoked to find some awesome IPA's, and to find out that they frequently bring in new ones. Fellow hop-heads will sympathize with me on this. I highly recommend this place if you enjoy a nice, strong IPA and some quality sushi!",4

"Yelp 100 Challenge 2013- 12/100\n\nCame up here to celebrate a friends birthday this past Friday evening. The park is nicely located next to Lone Mountain (hence the name.. duh).  This park offers ample picnic space that is covered, Tennis Ball Courts, Horseshoe Courts, large play area for kids, and bocce ball courts. \n\nThe only thing that was a slight disappointment was that by the time the sun went down, the play area was not lit up. We searched for lighting and didn't find any switches to light up the play area for my nieces. We enjoyed a few rounds of Bocce Ball and I will return solely for that-- Make sure you BYOB (bring your own bocce balls)",2

Staff is friendly and food is pretty good.  Will def be back!,3
"I'm someone who if I'm going to spend money on Italian food, I want it to be at least a 4-5 star type place. I really wanted to like this place. The service was excellent. The bread at the beginning of the meal was fresh and delicious. However the pizza was below average. As in I would stay away from ever ordering it again. The lasagna was very good. It tasted a lot like my wife's lasagna which is good, but we both felt to pay to go out we want better than we can make. I will probably try them again down the road to give them a second shot. Just sticking to pasta this time. To put my ranking into perspective... a chain like olive garden would get a 1-2 star from me. So they were better then the pasta co's, littering our nation. If it's this place vs those types of places without a doubt come here. But there is better out there.",2
"This is one of my least favorite places in all of Phoenix. I'll grant you that I'm more than a little biased against 'clubs' in general (I'd rather relax, talk, and laugh than get bumped around, shout, and pay $15 for a whiskey after waiting in line for 15 minutes). \n\nThat being said, this place is the worst of the worst as far as clientele goes. Every Phoenician has heard of the $35K / year Scottsdale millionaire. Well, this is where they all come on Friday and Saturday nights to take on more crushing credit card debt so they can pop some bottles and impress some trashy women. \n\nAre you a male in your twenties that likes cranberry mixers, works in 'finance' (read: entry level teller at Chase), leases a 328i, is not above slipping something in a girl's drink, and pretends to be some kind of pseudo-cowboy hardass at Country Thunder once a year? Then you'll love it here among your friends.\n\nAre you a woman that is attracted to the aforementioned Scottsdale Bro? You'll love it here as well.",0
"My first time coming to Snoh was an average experience. The selection was short and sweet, that's what I like most. The ice shavery is light and good. The owners need to work on their customer service though.The individual at the cash register was very friendly but the other two just stare at you and very discourteous. I wouldn't come here again until it improves.  I also ordered half green tea and half Thai and they only gave me Thai.",2

"I went here last night with a party of 4.  The place was pretty busy for 7pm on a Wednesday night so luckily I made a reservation and we were seated promptly.\n\nThe service was very friendly and helpful but pretty unattentive.  This was probably because there were way to many tables with way too many people and not enough waiters/waitresses/servers.  There were only 3 people  plus the cook(s) doing everything and they were clearly overwhelmed.\n\nThe other thing I didn't like was the menu.  It had far too many choices.  There were probably 200+ dishes on the thing.  So we basically gave up and everyone ordered a different kind of dish so we could all share.  We ended up getting a chicken dish, a shrimp dish, a vegetarian dish, and some sort of meat sampler thing.  We also ordered an appetizer sampler thing, some rice and some naan.\n\nEverything was very good and full of unique flavors.  I've never been to India and have only eaten Indian food 3 other times, but I thought the food here was very good.  The only problem with it was the price.  It was ridiculously priced for what you get.  The actual portion size is actually pretty good, but charging $15 for 5 shrimp or 5 pieces of lamb is ridiculous.  It is even more ridiculous because nothing comes with sides.  Everything is a la carte.  My wife got some kind of meat sampler (which came out a full 10 minutes before the rest of our meals) and it was laughable that it was $20. \n\nAnyway, this place pretty much robs you.  Luckily we had a certificate from Local Dines - http://bit.ly/dfR4eQ - which lessened the blow a bit but I was still pissed.  So, if you must go, get the certificate and you'll be glad you did.",2
"This place used to be good. I came here last night and ordered the asada burrito and it was all fatty, chewy pieces! By the time I finished I had a pile of meat on my plate that I had to throw away! I was so disappointed. My boyfriend on the other hand had the carnitas burrito which was fine. Never coming here again!!",0
"Great food and fast service.  The chips and salsa were tasty and spicy.  We loved how the carnitas had little fat on it.. Most places will just serve mostly fat, we got 100% meat.  It's our new favorite place to go and take out of towners looking for Mexican food.",4
"You get what you pay for. Nothing is super fresh. Seating was okay, drink service was friendly. Other patrons were loud, lots of\nkids. Not really somewhere I'd go again or recommend to others.",2
Don't ever go here in any holiday and expect to use any coupons that they send out for a free appetizer. They said no so I got a glass if water and the cheapest thing on the menu. I would have gotten much more but because of their attitude they don't deserve anything.  Shame on you Texas Roadhouse.,0
"For the area, the food is good-- not the best Mexican/Latin food that I have had, but definitely better than the standard El Toro/ Mas Amigos food. It is more Latin-American fusion than anything. Great tequila list. \n\nIn terms of mixed drinks, wish they had more margarita options like prickly pear, grapefruit, or tamarindo. But I will say that their standard lime margarita, which I judge all tequila bars/ Mexican restaurants against, was pretty good. Just too bad they use orange juice in the mix. \n\nAll in all I would go back again.",2
"This place is awesome!!! Came here last Saturday afternoon with the boyfriend and we had a great time! \n\nOnce we got settled in, we ordered drinks (I had the Strawberry Mule and the bf got a beer) and food (chicken with waffles and an order of the cheese beer dip with chips). \n\nThe game was sooo much fun!!! I don't play golf and I had a blast. We played on the first level but next time we'll ask for the 2nd level.\n\nWe'll def be coming back this summer!!!\nIf your wondering what to wear, wear comfy, casual clothes and sneakers. Have fun!!",4
"I just left Thirteen North after having lunch there for the first time. I had $30 to spend via my Restaurant.com certificate and planned to pack some of my leftovers for dinner tonight. \n\nHere's what I ordered: Calamari, Glazed Salmon (which comes with mixed veggies, garlic mashed potatoes or orzo pasta or side salad) and sweet potato fries. \n\nWhat I received: A side salad, a piece of non-glazed and dry salmon (I NEVER told her I didn't want my salmon to be glazed) with a full plate of sweet potato fries. \n\nI have friends that work in the restaurant industry and I also work in retail part time so I understand how people can get crazy about the things they spend money on. With that in mind, I really try to make it a point not to complain or ask for TOO much while dining.\n\nBut me + no food since 7:00AM = HANGRY. Today was NOT the day to mess up my order.  I just want my food, as I've ordered it. That's all. \n\nMy waitress, Jessica, was polite but when I asked her about the rest of my food she said she forgot my calamari and thought I only wanted fries with my salmon. At NO point did I tell her I didn't want the mixed vegetables or the orzo pasta with my food. She offered to have the veggies made, I said okay, but with my limited time due to my 1 hour lunch break and my extreme disappointment, I canceled it a few minutes later. She brought out my veggies anyways which I didn't bother to touch. \n\nI literally paid $20 for a dry piece of fish (which was decent and I ate ONLY because I was very hungry and out of time) and fries (which I took with me to go because they were pretty good). I was visibly VERY upset. Jessica said she wouldn't charge me for the veggies and she didn't.\n\nI'm usually a excellent tipper but I left her a $1 tip, wrote on my receipt why she only received a $1.  \n\n\nCustomer service is everything to me. This was not a good experience. Never again.",0
"Pros: Vegetarian option for the burgers, delicious shakes and occasional coupons make it affordable.\n\nCons: Can sometimes be messy (once there was ketchup on the seat and we often see food on the ground), and the entrees are just meh, although as I said the shakes are great.",2
"AWFUL!!!! The smell of mold in the area the motel wants you to eat breakfast in is so overwhelming that I actually have to hold my breath to get through. There are 26 concrete structures inside this area that also back up to the interior room windows. I've never been in a more unsanitary motel. Hopefully the owner takes note of this review and gets things cleaned. It will need a major overhaul. Check in was fine, although when I arrived, I waited about 5 min before a clerk presented themselves.",0
A decent makeover in terms of decor and stock with increased prices to match. The atmosphere early on a Saturday night was pleasant & the food looked worth a try so a return visit could well be on the cards but I'll be avoiding the steeper priced pints such as West's & Vedett.,2
"I know the prices for SW are super cheap, but it's not worth the horrible layovers they ALWAYS, ALWAYS have. \nI'd rather spend an extra $30 on another airline that has selected seating and a higher chance of leaving the terminal on time! \n\nUnless you got horrible money problems, this ain't the place for you!!",1
"Service was good, food was fast. Quality low, lots of rice with everything. sauces too overbearing. They do have a decent spicy ponzu though.. I ordered everything of course no yum sauce or eel sauce only a mammaluke would eat that shite! \nThey did a couple unique rolls , and a couple unique appetizers.. The who is your daddy which i order no cream cheese, no yum sauce or eel sauce was a joke they took one normal piece of shrimp which they pounded out thin and split it into 4 pieces wtf? I know they are trying so save cost fill u up on imitation crab and tempura batter + rice but that was quite unnecessary.\nI would never go back but I don't regret going there. go to Blue Fin...",1
"Definitely a great place to go for a quick, cheap, decent meal.  The only downside?? When I tried to order a corn quesadilla, the guy at the register told me they don't serve those. I then had to ask why it was on the menu. Fortunately, one of the other workers overheard and came over to help him.  Hello?! Maybe you should know your menu.  \n\nOtherwise, our overall experience was pleasant. The place is fairly clean for a fast food place and the food comes quick.",2
"I stayed at the Wigwam 2 nights for a work weekend retreat. This is a great location for retirees for mostly golfing and shopping. We happened to visit for a Leadership Summit for my company. This is a nice location to have a conference for work. The room was spacious with a wet bar, living room with fireplace, and luxuriously soft bed! I had the best nap of my life in that bed. It was divine! The decor is Southwestern/Ranch style. I am more of a fan of modern decor but I was still very comfortable during my stay. I would not normally stay here mainly due to the style but I found it very relaxing and comfortable.",3
"You don't go to a place like this expecting great food or outstanding service.You come here to experience the atmosphere and DRINKS.\n\nYes, they are drunk chubby college chicks acting a fool  That is because they are trying not to face reality that they will never be the skinny chick with the hot dude.\n\nThe DJ's are always great, the staff is always having fun.  if you get a table that faces the strip you can always people watch too.  The shop has reasonable prices for souvenirs as well.",2

"Any chance I have to make it to Liberty Market with friends I will! I love this place! They make a fantastic cup of coffee and amazing panini sandwiches.

"Yelp 100 Challenge 14' * 27/100\n\nGood but not great. \n\nService was delightful. We had an attentive server who was prompt and cheerful. He got our food in on time and happily split he check when we were done. Food was as they were. Couldn't help but wish there was a wider variety of yum tsa food choices like cheung fun (beef wrapped in vermicelli noodles) or sweet tofu dessert. Nonetheless, they had a buy 1 get 1 free promotion that day for the chicken siu mai which was a nice surprise. \n\nBathroom had mood lighting by the sink but was pitch black once we entered the cubicles.

"Is there a way to give zero stars?? \nI was waiting in a long line for a taxi home from Phx Sky Harbor. When I finally was given a cab I asked if they took credit. The cab driver said if he had to he could but asked if I would be willing to go to an ATM for cash. I explained after a trip all I had was a credit card and he went on to complain about how he was going to get paid less if I used credit.\n\nOkay, that's annoying but hardly the beginning of it. I live about 2 miles from the airport. The driver kept his meter covered by paper. When I asked why, he said I'd be paying $16, which was the minimum. I asked why the sign said the min. was 15, and he said if I was going to argue he'd leave me there at the side of the road...  Well, I wasn't arguing to begin with, but that was enough for me to shut up. I was a girl alone in a cab and pretty intimidated. \n\nI sent my friend a txt trying to explain my situation and he called back to keep me on the phone so I could continuously update him on my location in case the driver decided to be any crazier. Once I was at my destination I decided it would be best for the driver to drop me at the front of my complex so he wouldn't know exactly where I lived. He used a carbon copy device to get my card # and handed me the receipt to sign without giving my card back. I scribbled in a $2 tip worried that he was going to give me a hard time about giving me my card back or allowing me to access my suitcase in the trunk. The driver was completely intimidating the entire time and insisted I leave a phone number with him before he would return my card to me. \n\nWhen I got to my apt, I called the company to complain. The first person I spoke to was very understanding and apologetic for my experience. She took down my acct and said she'd put it through to the road supervisor who would have to do the follow-up. She promised the my information could stay anonymous from the driver upon my request.\n\nAbout an hour later, at nearly 10pm, the supervisor called and asked me to repeat the situation to him. He said he NOT able to keep my information anonymous. That he would deal with the driver tonight to hear his side of the \""story\"". That if I felt my personal safety was in jeopardy that I would have to contact the police. \n\nAbsolutely one of the worst cab companies imaginable. I cannot believe any business can successfully run like this. I will go out of my way to never use them again.",0

"I had a 50th Birthday celebration for my mother in Las Vegas and planned a dinner for a total of 20 people, and this buffet was the one I chose. I had emailed the guest services and they had forwarded me to the City Wide Restaurant Group Sales. I was given a quote for my event, and even ordered a specialty cake through the baker. \nI was quoted for each adult attendee a price of $68.99, and per child $26.99. They gave me a maximum of two hours for my event of 20 people (children and elderly included), and anything over that time frame would be an additional $500 per half hour. I also ordered a specialty cake (pictures below) that cost me a total of $340.00. I also already knew that I would be charged gratuity for my large party which I was more than comfortable with as this is done anywhere you go with a large group. The actual price for an adult dinner is $53.99... RIPPED OFF and I didn't even know it until I saw the prices when I arrived.\nWhen I arrived to the location I checked in as advised, waited about ten minutes, and we were brought to our table. There was no line outside for regular check in which I was surprised about being that it was a Saturday night in Vegas. We were taken to our tables in the back of the restaurant and separated into two round tables. Had I known I was going to have to separate my party into two round tables, I would have never came here. They had plenty of long tables that they could have put together to have the entire party I was with sit together. There were also 4 other large tables in this area that were seated in our section. We were all seated and greeted by our one server and drink requests were taken.\n The first round of food has been completed and the plates on the tables have stacked up at this point, no waiter around refilling drinks and no place for anyone to get any more food without making the tables completely cluttered. I couldn't believe that they would stick ONE waiter for a large party like mine, let alone ONE waiter for the entire back area of SIX tables. It was frustrating that it was a mess, that my guests were unable to get refills when they were empty and I felt bad for the waiter mostly. Sitting around waiting for the tables to be cleaned and refills takes time out of my two hour window.\nHalf way through dinner my brother decides to take my niece to the dessert section to check out all that they had and let me just begin by saying WOW. The cake I ordered was a SURPRISE, the staff knew this, the lady at the group sales knew this, all my guests knew this. My brother returns to ask me if I had seen the cake I ordered...my response was no. He told me that the cake is sitting out at the dessert section in plain view, and is GREEN!!!! I went over to check the cake out and indeed it was green and in plain view. Low and behold my mother walks up and sees the cake that was supposed to be a surprise. A complete disaster. I spoke with the Manager and told him I would not be paying for this cake as it is not what we agreed on. I spent 45 min dealing with this cake situation, as my guests are sitting and waiting for the cake to be brought out all in the 2 hour time frame we are allowed. The surprise was ruined, the cake was ruined, and the entire event at this point went to crap. When the cake finally came out, we were given a knife and the cake. We asked for plates and they gave us HOT plates. I then proceeded to the dessert section to gather cold plates myself, and the manager was upset that I had to do this myself. We cut our own cake and served our own cake as there was no assistance.\nLong story short, I was over charged per person $15 for an hour prior to the event that I was not told about, yet I could not stay an extra 30 min without being charged to accommodate the small children and elderly people in my party. My guests and I wasted 45 min of our time waiting on a cake that was a complete disaster. They decided to reimburse me for the cake and throw in 2 buffet passes for my next visit. Do they really think that I will ever return to this buffet, that my guests who spent hundreds of dollars to fly out and spend the weekend in Vegas will return to their buffet? This is a large company that should pride themselves on the service they provide, on the bakery they have and on the way they handle a situation that is brought to their attention.\nWhen I emailed regarding the overcharge, she simply stated that's what you pay when we have to hold your table prior to your arrival. When I asked her other questions she disregarded them and didn't answer. When I was finally able to get in touch with her manager, her response was \""What do you feel is fair\""? I decided to stop talking to this inconsiderate people, and write a review on Yelp to allow others to make an informed decision on their next party they decide to throw.",0
"Skip the food....While it looks asian, it tastes like a frozen wanna-be asian dinner...Yuck.  I only rated this place a \""3\"" because of the lounge//bar Asian/tropical decor.  Fun place to drink, depending on the crowd.  Eat elsewhere. I haven't yet tried the kareoke rooms.",2
"When you have a large group of people what could be a better dining choice than Italian?  For our first meal in Montreal this place was a good find.\n\nThis place had the feel of a family owned restaurant.  The Italian men walking around in that place just cracked me up, especially the elderly gentleman in the sunglasses.    \n\nThe atmosphere was cute and a little bit on the kitschy side.  They had a tree in the middle that had lit up grapes on them.  In addition, they had strolling musicians taking requests.  The service was good as well.  They did a good job splitting our checks which made it a good choice for our larger group. \n\nThe food was good.  I had a bowl of minestrone and a pizza with green peppers and pepperoni.  The soup was slightly on the salty side, but it had a good amount of vegetables which is just what I was looking for.  The meat on the pizza was of very good quality and the cheese was good as well.",2
This place is great! Three of us got pedicures with very short notice. They gave very long massages and my nails look great!,4
"I likey!  Normally I go to the traditional Korean places in Sahara Commercial Center or near Chinatown. For a quick and easy place, this place is just right.\n\nService - Very nice for a fast food place.\n\nFood - the Jun's Special with all sorts of meat is great.\n\nKim Chee - they have plenty of selection and all decent.\n\nBi Bim Bap - They have my favorite food besides the kalbi and bulgogi. It was nicely flavored.\n\nPrice - Decent.\n\nOverall - OK, it cannot compare to the BBQ places that are more traditional, but this is for the money and for the location, a very goo place. I will go again!",3
"I am giving Durger Dog top ratings . . .love this place! First, everything is super tidy and simple giving nice first impression. I have to say, we are hot dog people! LOVE them. But, if you are not, DD is still the place for you--the hamburgers look delicious! I had the Classic hot dog with Garlic Sauce--so good! I also had a few bites of the Western, also very good! We ordered the onion rings, I loved them (they are thin onion string style), but my honey felt they were a bit too cooked. So, when we go again, and if we order the onion rings, we will ask them to \""lightly\"" cook these wonderful additions to our hot dog meal. And in conclusion, APPLE FRIES! Seriously delicious. Light and fluffy~who knew! They do!\n\nWe had the nicest chat with the manager/owner and we heard about the serious work that went in to finding the perfect balance for everything on the menu--and it shows! We will be back and will encourage whoever will listen to us--build more!\n\nOh, and every single person that waited on us did so with so much professionalism. A delightful place to go. Thank you Durger Dog!",4
"The place gives the feel of a small town diner which is pretty cool and our server was very prompt and friendly. \n\nAs for the food, it was ok but nothing to get excited and recommend friends to. I've read that the chicken fried steak was amazing but the server told me they're not fresh but frozen which killed that idea. \n\nHere's the why for 3 stars:\nWe had a breakfast burrito smothered with a $.99 side of pancakes and coffee. Huevos rancheros with coffee and a strawberry crepe with water. Our bill total was $48 for the three of us and the girl at the register couldn't explain why. And that didn't include the tip! \n\nWe came here because our other favorites had long waits and when I called they said they could sit us immediately, should've known something wasn't right.\n\nBottom line we would not go back as nothing stood out, if the food was out of this would I wouldn't mind the expense.",2
"Based on Yelp reviews I dined here for dinner while passing through.  It's clean and well lit.  While I wouldn't choose this place for ambiance per se, that's not what I was looking for, I was looking for good food and I found it.  I ordered a penne pasta with Salmon which had excellent flavor.  The bread was a sesame seed roll and was quite tasty.  The salad was a bit wilted and the Italian dressing was horrible.  It was a very thick, viscuous very commercial tasting blob.  Based on reviews I would have expected something much better.  This would not stop me fromr returning, I just wouldn't have that dressing again.  \n\nGreat place to stop.  \n\nMy waitress was no-nonsense and mostly efficient though I felt she could have checked in more for refills and I ended up asking another waitress for my check because my waitress disappeared.  Still worth stopping!",2
"is eva longoria really the owner of eve? that's what i heard.\nsomeone needs to tell her that go-go dancers are supposed to DANCE and not do the two step while looking like they don't want to be there -_-  i also thought it was a little weird that we got three different prices for a bottle of goose.  they need to get their prices right.\n\naside of the bad entertainment and shotty bottle prices, i did enjoy this club.  music was pretty good, it's a good size, there are a good amount of tables, dance floor has a good amount of room, bathrooms are clean, and the service was friendly.  my friends and i had a table which was close to the dance floor...easy access to the dance floor is always a must.  in the table in front of us some football player had some kind of party.  fun times.  and about an hour before we left, they announced that the jabbawockeez  were in the house (i swear i didn't see them though).  \n\nin conclusion, even though my friends and i were probably 6 out of 10 asians in there, i had a really good time.  because after all, it's not supposed to matter where you are, but rather, who you're with right? :)",2
"Went with a group for work.  Initially I couldn't find it (it is actually IN the mall) and then had to circle around to find parking to avoid the $6 valet.  Food was ok.  I had the kimchi chicken (I don't eat much sea food), ordered largely because one of the sides was bok choi.  I was quite disappointed when brocolini was on my plate instead.  We tried the \""salted caramel popcorn creme brulee.\""  It is as crazy as it sounds.  The caramel popcorn was very good, the creme brulee was more like a salty custard. \nThe server was very polite.",1
"Hey, those GVR people must have read my review, because it looks like the rooms have been remodeled since the last time I was here. The hotel hallways look a lot chicer with dark walls and abstract patterned carpets. The rooms also got a makeover and the armoire with the tv has been replaced by a set of drawers with a big flat screen. The place is looking better than ever!",3
"This was my first dinning experience at this restaurant and I'm sorry to report that chances are slim to none that I will ever return.  The service was average at best, wait time was much slower than it should be.  The champagne arrived warm and it took over 20 minutes for it to get to an acceptable chill.  I had to ask the waiter to please bring more ice since when we complained that it was warm and they didn't respond.\n\nWe shared the foie gras and it was extremely small for $20 and the toast served with it was so heavily drenched in butter it overpowered the taste.  We had to ask for plain bread instead.  We then had the salmon entree and a side order of the mac n cheese.  Very nice flavor and we left feeling satisfied.\n\nHowever, around 5 hours later, we both started experiencing stomach cramps and diarrhea.  This went on all night long.  I wasn't happy about spending $180 for dinner and getting sick, so the next morning I called to tell management our experience.  I wasn't sure what to, but I thought they should know.  She spoke to me very courteously, but basically said, ' they checked all their food for expiration, and no one else complained\"".  This reaction annoyed me.  I feel at the very least an apology was in order and perhaps offer of something on our next visit, anything!  This is very poor customer service and I will not return there again.  There are too many places for fine dinning here, i don't have to patronize an establishment that is not concerned about my comfort or satisfaction.",1
"Love, love, love this place!!! Delicious, decent price. Clean environment.  Fun place to go on date night or a special treat for the kids. If you get a chance, meet the owners. They truly appreciate their customers which is so nice. I saw them at Costco once and they went out of their way to say 'hi' to me. What a great small business. I will continue to support them because they deserve my business. TIP - This place gets busy so if you see a table getting ready to vacate, grab it!",4
Always great food. Spicy rating can be a little hot or miss. Defiantly love the Panang but don't get the egg rolls - I can get better out of a freezer at the grocery store and I wish they delivered as we are only 2 miles away.,2
"Great Burros, interesting creations and all at a good price.",3
Came here today because Crepe Bar was a crowded mess.  I was pleasantly surprised.  My croissant was deliciously buttery and flaky.  The chef came out to ask how the meal was.  The coffee was actually WAY better than Crepe Bars (which tastes sour like Dunkin Donuts to me).\nThey only lose a star for service and that's just because they seem to need a number system so the girl bringing out the food isn't going up to every table with your food.,3
"Nothing amazing but pretty good Mexican food that is sort of like any of the large Mexican chains. The tacos were fresh, HOT, and had a good flavor. The rice and black beans were also pretty good. They used to offer free chips and salsa like most Mexican restaurants but now charge $2.99 for them.\n\nThis place isn't a must try in Vegas but if you're on the strip and want Mexican food you won't go wrong here.",2
"Called to make an appointment for a \""Complete\"" car wash and was quoted a price.  When I arrived, the price doubled.  The salesman thought it was really funny.  The manager backed him.  I used to be a regular customer (four cars!) for many years.  Time to move onto another car wash company.",0
Very fun and exciting I want to do it again!!!,4
"Finally decided to create a yelp account just so I could rant about Republic Services. \n\nWhen we lived in Vegas, these guys were great! Service twice a week, relatively cheap, and they would take anything I threw on the curb. Even an old couch! IT wasn't until about 4 years after we moved out of state that the issues came up.\n\nWhen we left Vegas, we canceled the service, and everything was cool. We couldn't sell the house we decided to rent it out. I guess when a property is rented the owner is still responsible for trash. Trash bills supposedly kept coming, but no one ever got them. Republic Services never made any attempts to contact me, just kept letting the bills, liens, and court fees piling up. \n\n3 years down the road, our tenant is gone and we are trying to do a short sale on the place. My agent just happened to notice that there is now an $800 lien on the property. I contacted Rep Services and they said to cancel the trash service, I need to produce a final electric bill, showing power has been shut off (to verify the property is vacant). They keep citing the \""City Ordinance\"" that required this (Its true, I looked it up. LVCO 9.08.210 paragraph (B)). I called NV Energy, since the power is under the tenants name, they cannot give me the bill, or even release it to Rep Services. So I have to track down the tenant (property manager was NO help- look for another review on them coming soon!) myself, get her to get a copy of the bill, send it to me, so I can send it to Rep Services. It took me months, but I was finally able to get it, now they are saying it's not the right one, it doesn't say FINAL BILL on it, etc...  I get the run around every time I call. Meanwhile, I'm still stuck paying for trash service at an empty house, and my short sale is being help up even more than normal because of this. \n\nWhat really pisses me off is that Republic Services has not make ONE attempt to contact me, send me a bill, or notice, replied to an email, nothing! I am constantly having to call to get updates, and of course, get a different rep every time. Whoever wrote that damn ordinance has got to be in bed with Republic Services, and should have put in a provision for GETTING a power bill if it is going to be required.",0
"Really a strong 4.5. Knocking off .5-1 star for the use of canola oil when they have so much rendered animal fat laying around. Not just healthier, just plain tastes better. \n\nBeyond that - WOW. Just go. \n\nOrdered:\n\nBone Marrow\nMac n Cheese\nLamb Burger\nDuck Breast\nKorean Rueben\nSalmon\n\nAll amazing. All cooked to the proper and requested level of doneness/temp. \n\nService was awesome and paced well in terms of how the dishes came out. \n\nAtmosphere - even with a full-house - was relaxing and quiet enough you didn't need to shout in order to have a conversation. \n\nAfter going to both here and Cure - it's no contest.....M&P HANDS DOWN! \n\nI think I may have found my new favorite. Go and enjoy!",3
"Came here on Easter Sunday with some co-workers. We got a deal on tickets through our work. First time coming to a 51s game and it was definitely a good experience. The field has large dimensions and kinda makes for a pitchers park, but that particular day the ball was flying. I'm sure the games get very interesting with the weird weather around here. I love how the restaurant on the top floor is open to everyone, unlike professional stadiums where it costs a lot extra. Looking forward to going to many more games now that I'm a local.",4
"This was my first time in an ABC store. I'm still getting used to the liquor laws in NC. \n\nFor instance, I'm on a mojito kick and needed rum and club soda. Thinking I could get most of the ingredients at the ABC store, I was wrong; they can only sell items with alcohol in it. Thankfully Harris Teeter was next door to complete my mojito making trip.\n\nThe cashier was really friendly. Clean and organized store. I truly appreciated the large signs on the walls directing me straight to what I needed.\n\nI was in and out within minutes...just how it should be.",3
"Man I love this place, be sure to get the chicken tacos with guacamole and pour some extra hit sauce on ( house made ).\n\nTacos are huge and 2 typically fills me up.  I always grab lunch here when I am in town- about 20 min from the strip in traffic but worth the trip if you have a car.",3
"Maybe I went on a bad day?  I went with a group of friends here and got the rotisserie chicken with rice along with some fried plantains.  I love plantains, and there is nothing you can do wrong with them, but the chicken on the other hand... Man, talk about dry, dry, dry, dry, dry, and dry.  It was dry and flavorless.  It was the worst.  Also, my friend got sick after eating here.",1
"Mediocre. That best sums up my experience. However, it should be noted that I just came back from Paris so perhaps my expectations were higher. That said, I have tried French food in the states. As such, I can't go beyond two stars. I think this restaurant suffers from not trying hard enough. The breads were not up to par, the vegetables over saturated, and the meat run of the mill, with no distinction in flavor.  It's like they have a few template dishes and they remake it over and again, with varying quality. To me, the appeal of French cuisine is that a lot of attention and care is focused on the nuance of flavors and the artistry of the final product. I feel like this restaurant is more focused on giving Americans the image of French food but not the substance. But I guess this is fitting, as it is in Las Vegas (note the fake eiffel tower, european replicas). So in that respect, this Bouchon is every bit as kitschy as the place it's located. While Las Vegas' kitsch is part of its charm, this doesn't quite work for Bouchon. Even the staff appear to be part of the spectacle, ad hoc accents all over the place.  Hopefully, someone comes in and will rescue this place from being cruise ship fare  and turn it into a good option for French food on the  strip.",1
"They definitely tried for ambience, but the fact that the windows overlook a parking lot and a busy road, there was not a whole lot they could do.  \nStaff was nice and freindly, but the teryaki was way too sweet and sticky.  The crab rangoon was good, though.  All in all, I would say Ginza of Tokyo is much better.",1
"Mon mari a voulu m'inviter dans ce restaurant lorsque nous avons appris ma seconde grossesse... nous etions accompagn\u00e9 de notre petit garcon de 3 ans.\n\nLe service \u00e9tait horrible ! Pas un bonjour ni un sourire m\u00eame quand notre petit bonhomme \u00e9tait poli et a gentiment dit bonjour a notre serveuse... qui elle ne s' est pas presenter.\n\nIl y avait 4 choix indisponibles... \n\nJ'ai pris du poulet,  tr\u00e8s bon. \nMon mari a pris du boeuf, la cuisson \u00e9tait pas la bonne... a 2 reprises !\n\nBref pas terrible.et cher pour ce que nous avons pris...\n\nJe n'y retournerai pas",1
"I've been wanting to come back since the last time I came to lunch here with friend and fellow Yelper Dyanna L. Since it was my birthday, my Dad wanted to take me out to lunch and I knew this would be the spot to take both him and Joel! Boy, I was right! Still totally sticking with my 5 stars. Wish I could give more it was that good. \n\nThis time we split the Duck Bao. The duck was tender and had a little piece of skin! Can you say PERFECT! It's so hard to pick what you want here. Cause I want ALL the things. I went with the special, which was the PBBLT. It was Pork Belly with Bacon, lettuce, tomato and a spicy aioli on Sourdough Bread and a side salad. \nJoel got the Short Rib Grilled Cheese with Fries. He can not stop talking about this sandwich! He said it's not just the best Grilled Cheese he has ever had, but most likely the best sandwich he'll ever have!!!\nMy Dad had the Crispy Duck Leg with Rice. He was so impressed with it all. He cleaned his plate and picked every piece of duck off that leg. \n\nThe Staff is so friendly and very informative of all the dishes! I have to say if it couldn't get any better they have a Coke 100 machine! So I can have ALL the Diet soda flavors!!! Including my current favorite Coke Zero Cherry! \n\nYAY Fat Choy's! I can not wait to be back to eat more of your delicious food!",4
"I have been going to one Valle Luna or another for the past 15 years. Their food is standard Mexican-in-Arizona and plentiful for the most part, but guess what I just found out? THEY HAVE GREAT CHICKEN WINGS! \n\nI know, weird, huh? My faves are the honey-hot, fried and grilled.",3
Very friendly staff and great food!,4
"I've been going to this car show for quite sometime now as its basically in my back yard and so has my car club. We pretty much were birthed as a club here and have enjoyed showcasing our cars. It gets a star for accessibility when that's possible and another for the Target, YCs and Yogurtology close by. It would have more stars though if the owners, Salt River Project Police Department and management company stopped punishing clubs that have nothing to do with the poor choices of individuals (those who choose to do burn outs, make traffic problems and ruin it for first time attendees). I've been  asked to leave early twice now for my car (it has an interactive sound system and is a Transformers Edition Bumblebee Camaro). Not a cheap car by any makes or means, but it's not being shown to make this show look good, but for the children who enjoy seeing one of their favorite pop culture characters up close and personal.\n\nI think what's really sad is when assumptions are made and those who go to this show and have for a while are lumped in with those who ruin it. I went to the McDonald's that hosts this show and they have no show guidelines on sight. I looked online and the hours vary from 4-8 to 4-10. On July 13 we were all asked to leave at 10 as the show was over. I was asked to turn my car down to a muted level as my sound was competing with their DJs. In the past I was allowed to showcase my system after 8pm but that's not the case anymore I guess. If I didn't comply, I would be asked to leave.\n\nLike I said I've been asked to leave once already last year for the same reason but it was before 8. If complying by their rules and guidelines after 8 is a problem then they're going to have to make the public aware of it, not make an example out of someone in an embarrassing manner. \n\nBut the biggest problem I have with this show is the disappointment I have been able to witness in a young child's face because of \""management.\"" Nothing breaks my heart more than the sadness of a child. Especially when they can't get a picture taken with my car or even try to enjoy it with my family. I watched that last night. I hope I never see that again. Hearing a child say goodbye too early and because of someone else's poor decisions is not acceptable in my book. \n\nI foresee a loss in interest, revenue, attendance and maybe I'll be back. Maybe. There are other shows to go to and I'd hate to not come back because of someone else. Thank you for your time and as Optimus Prime says \""Roll Out.\""",1
"Fantastic!  This was our second time around, and everything is just wonderful.  Along with the wide variety of meats they serve three side dishes that consist of mashed potatoes, polenta and plantains.  They also serve warm cheese bread to go with your meal.  The polenta and cheese bread are to die for.  Servers are always attentive and replace sides and cheese bread as needed or.  The meat is succulent, cooked really appropriately.  There were times I felt the seasoning was a little off, but I am known to be a salt freak.  \n\nThe way it works:  They have you start with the salad bar.... Resist the urge, there's so many yummy meats you will want to eat.  If you must, there is a wide variety of veggies, cheeses and other anti pasto to choose from (keep this light).  \n\nWhen ready for meat service, simply flip your green/red card green and servers will immediately bring you your sides, and new plates for your meats.  As long as your card is green the meat servers will stop by your table and offer you meat - use the provided tongs to grab meat.",3
"I used to love going to PetSmart with my boys (dogs) and being able to shop together. I love their food selections and its the only place I will get my pet products from. Now I dread going in there though. The customer service people are in my face asking if I want to get my dog groomed or trained or whatever other services they want to put in my face and they make it hard to even get past the front door! Most of the time I do not want to spend a lot of time in there so when this occurs I am really out of time by the time I even leave the front door! I am a dog trainer and my friend is  a groomer I do not need services, I just need my dog's kibble!",1
"Fail, fail, fail...\nI've had a bunch of people tell me that this place is great for breakfast, but after one visit I assure you it is not. Soggy, flat omlette, hash brown mushiness, tough pancakes and weak a** coffee.  My girlfriend's waffle was covered in strawberry goo and coolwhip, and when we asked for syrup, we were served a big side of attitude.  Which brings me to my second problem: the service was sub par at best. Waste of time, complete waste of money, will not return. To anyone who thinks this place is great: step outside of the little box that you live in and try something else, trust me there's much better breakfast to be had in Pittsburgh",0
"I'm a hungry out-of-state contractor looking for a simple Subway breakfast flatbread.  But the Yelp reviews tempted me to try something local.\n\nAnd glad I did.  Sandella's had flatbreads, paninis, and soups freshly prepped at 10AM.  I ordered a burrito for the guy on the work site and the Tuscan Chicken Panini for myself.\n\nUnfortunately I had many other stops, I didn't get to the panini until 2PM that day.  Maybe I was famished.  Or may it simply was awesome.  But it was one of the better paninis I've had in the parking lot of a tile store.\n\nDISCLAIMER: Do what I say not what I do.  I had no after-math issue eating a 4 hour old sandwich; but one should really refrigerate all foods that are not immediately consumed.",4
Love this place! I have been coming here since they opened and will still be coming back cause everyone are friendly and so is the owner. He will go out of his way to come to your table and say hi!! :) food is great!!!!,4
"I really like this pub, although I immediately feel the need to qualify that statement. It has its detractors, and their criticisms are valid, but like any successful brand, its smugness is the price you have to pay for the quality of the product. So I guess that makes JP's the iPod of pubs.\n\nFirst, the good. It's big, nicely decorated, has a variety of seating, from couches to tables, and they have a variety of international beer. Only one real ale on handpull though, which is a bit of a travesty in Edinburgh, but they have some in bottles. Most Edinburghers will be familiar with this Swedish theme shtick (they also own Victoria's, Boda Bar and Sofi's), but what can I say, it works.\n\nThen the bad. It's ridiculously overpriced. At \u00a34.40 a pint, it must be the most expensive pint in Edinburgh (for a pub), making London look reasonably priced. I really can't believe I would pay that much for a pint, but when you're on Leith Walk and looking for a good pub, or a handy meeting place, or you want to park your fixed wheel bike, sink into a couch and whip out your MacBook, then this is the place. Hang on, didn't I just say I liked it here?\n\nAnother downside is the noise. There's something about the acoustics there that makes it really hard to hear what people are saying. Or maybe that's just my age. What?!\n\nThey also do food. I've never eaten there, but I've heard it's good. During the day it's a yummy mummy hangout, with a play area and light lunches. One of their quirks is to put the menus in old Disney comics. I was a bit embarrassed once when a waitress asked if I was ready to order but I wasn't looking at the menu; I was reading the Donald Duck comic!\n\nSo yes, it's smug, expensive and tends to be frequented by 30-something middle class people. But it's big, beautiful and central. I think a few years ago I would have said it was too posh and up itself. But now I'm a sad 30-something and I like it. Hey, it has wifi and Birra Morretti on tap. Now where's my iPod?",3
"I think I like Miette cupcakes more. These were super hard and dry. Though I had the flourless, it was super dense. I also ordered the lemon coconut, and still dry. The frosting was not soft and fluffy, more like hard and overly sweet. The place is pretty neat though. One side is cupcakes only, the other is ice cream + cupcake experience. Basically you pick a cupcake and put ice cream on it. Or you can have ice cream with cookies like an ice cream sandwich. A bit pricy for me for two cupcakes around $7.50.",1
I agree with another comment on here...I rarely have cash and I asked if tip could go on card..He said just this time...so I guess no tip next time if I don't have cash...not going back there. ..oh and their prices are higher than a few other nearby nail salons.,1
I am writing this review for lunch:\n\nThe other day for work a few of us went to The Place for lunch.  I had the Avocado burger and fries.  I can't say anything about this burger was really good or bad.  It was just an average burger with average fries.  \n\nMy coworkers ordered another burger that looked average and a club sandwich that looked like any other club sandwich you get at a diner.  \n\nI don't see the why the great reviews for this place but I guess I will have to try it for breakfast to see what the fuss is about.,2
"Okay you can't beat complimentary trio fries and bread. Also at the end, instead of mInts we got some complimentary chocolate Carmel popcorn. Good thing I skipped the bread too cuz the 6oz Waygu (A5 grade for roughly $165) with the trio potato pur\u00e9e was very filling. Moreover their Long Island Ice Tea tastes very good (though not very alcoholic) but their Rockin' Rye (? Orange drink) tastes superb and has a nice kick for a whiskey mix.  Also if you are into red wines the Hirsch Cuvee for Michael Mina Pinot Noi is a superb red wine to go with your selection of steak ($25).  Moreover the service was superb and very helpful when ordering.  I will definitely come back to this place again.",4
"Definitely wait to come here after 11:30 a.m. If you arrive early like I did at 10:45 a.m. everything they're serving isn't fresh. The first 3-4 dishes we ate were cold and disappointing. But once they start pushing around the fresh dim sum carts, the food is pretty decent. Just keep your expectations low and do not order the Wonton Noodle Soup (it's not worth the $7). I wouldn't eat here again if I could help it, supposedly there are better dim sum places in Vegas.",1
"My husband and I decided to try this place out for one of our date nights. Overall the experience was okay. \n\nAtmosphere - The place was pretty hopping for a Tuesday night, but we got seated almost right away. The atmosphere was very \""clubby,\"" not intimate or cozy. Definitely resembled a place you'd go to pick up someone or go with a group of friends. \nService - The hostess and server were friendly enough. Our primary server was nice, but not very attentive. She only checked on us once during our meal. The gal who brought out our food was not very friendly and seamed to be in a rush. She'd run food out, curtly announce what it was, and then shove it onto the table and huff off. It could be that she was short-handed and was really busy, but it was a little off-putting. \nDrinks - We ordered a beer and a Wango Mango martini (we were delighted to find out that Tuesdays were Ladies Night with 1/2 price martinis. My husband asked our server if she could believe that he was a lady so he could get in on the deal. She was not amused). While the martini was tasty, it was weak and I could not justify ordering one for regular price. ($9.50 for a martini!? Yikes!)\nFood - I appreciated the variety of the menu, from appetizers, to signature rolls there was a lot to choose from. Here is what we ordered:\n       Pork Eggrolls - Yum! Nice and crispy, not greasy, and a delicious dipping sauce        to boot!\n       Salmon Nigiri - Good portion size, tasted very fresh\n       Dam Jumper - A little on the small size, a nice change-up of having the roll wrapped in salmon, the least favorite of the three rolls we ordered\n       Tropic Thunder - Very, very good. Sweet and spicy, the pineapple salsa was an interesting and delicious addition, nice large-sized roll \n       Philadelphia - Your typical Philly roll, good size, very fresh tasting\nPrice - As mentioned before, martini prices were very steep. As for food, there were many higher priced rolls on the menu and almost everything seemed to be priced a dollar or two more than what's typically at most sushi establishments. \n\nSo, overall, the food was good. Only a few things stood out as winners. But definitely not worth the price. As numerous reviewers have mentioned, go for happy hour. Then it may be worth it.",1
"I'd give 3.5 stars but oh wells :/\nI went there since my bf wanted to try this place out. I got spicy miso and he got ronin. My spicy miso felt like it was based on korean pepper sauce, which I did not mind but it had weird...sweetness added to it. (maybe it happened when they mixed miso? I don't know) Burger was pretty greasy... :/ My bf didn't really say much about his burger so I guess it's not amazing nor bad!\nHonestly it was decent burger... However, the wait, service was below average. We had to wait half an hour for our order and another half an hour for check. Seriously? There weren't that many people. They need to work on their service. No one wants to wait hour for burger! :/",2
"Finding Mama Mia's Pizza was like finding a $10 bill in the gutter.  I felt so excited when I saw the pizzas they were making and how everyone was pulling steaming, cheesy goodness from their lips.  I dunno if they have Chicago style here, but the pizza I had was New York to a T. Or should I say NY...  I got 2 slices of the cheese pizza and a soda. the rest is history.\n\nIt all started when I was hungry for some Hippies Burgers.  Unfortunately, it was December 26th and they were closed.  At first I was devestated, yet through the tears in my eyes, I managed to look up and see a sign for Mama Mia's.  I said \""What the Hell\"" and stopped in. It was quaint, and when I say quaint I really mean, cramped.  Its got a little TV in the corner and I caught a glimpse of Cher's breasts pinned to the wall with some tape.  There's nothing that says good pizza better than 1970's Cher and her nude chest.\n\nI order the special, pay my $4.99 and sit down.  The pizza is made while you watch and it comes fast! Piping hot and delicious.  One of CenPho's hidden secrets!\n\nBONUS* They also have hot subs!!!",3
"2 stars for the non-existent customer service and the fact that there's a $10 minimum to use your debit/credit card. We come from LA where there's an overabundance of Filipino bakeries who bake pandesal and other delicacies fresh all throughout the day. Though I frequent this area because of the Filipino market next door, I have never been to this bakery before last night. We walk in and it's fairly empty, the cashier just stares at us, no smile offered not even a polite hello. So we proceeded to browse the store, I then asked her if they had fresh pandesal and according to her they only make their breads in the morning. I grabbed a bag of pandesal and cheese filled bread. She rang it up and then informed me I had to get more things for the $10 minimum if I wanted to use my card. This irritated me even more because I rarely carry cash, I was forced to grab and spend more due to their required minimum UGH! The worst thing is knowing that I will probably be back at one point due to the lack of Filipino bakeries in Las Vegas. Best believe I will have cash the next time I come though! LOL",1
"Maybe it's because I was here for brunch and the menu selection wasn't very good.  \n\nI had the spicy chicken and sweet potato hash with poached eggs.  I thought it was kinda mushy and not really a \""hash\"", and too sweet for my taste.  Gobs of tabasco didn't help much either.  I also had some of my cousin's egg scramble tortilla thing, which was ok as well.  Nothing to really rave about.  But the cheesy grits were soooooo good.  Had I known how good they were, I would've gave up on my entree and just ate the whole little bowl of grits.\n\nI did like the goat cheese fondue with tortilla chips.  And my Bloody Mary was tasty and spicy, just the way I like it.  But overall?  I expected more from a Bobby Flay restaurant.  Maybe I'll go back to try dinner.",2
This casino used to be 5 stars but is in dire need for further renovations or other ways to drive traffic back to this casino.,1
worst service ever. I went in for a quick fill the guys said 20 mins so i waited. then a pedicure walks in for 2 people and all of a sudden the lady that was suppose to do my nails next goes to do the pedi. They dont serve you first come first served and they wasted my time. never going back and im glad i didnt spend any of my money for their poor customer service.,0
"Honestly nothing special. People still eat there don't ask me. Food Is Bland Theye Skimp On Hummus, man dunk the stuff on my plate it's good for me I want more of it. This place give soo little hummus, nothing really memorable. ...",1
"I love going to pride, but Phoenix really needs to consider 1) getting better artists to play the music aspect of it, because almost every year its not very good! The best was when pride had joan jett and berlin, every other year after that it has pretty much sucked....not worth staying for. For that reason and for the #2 reason...WHHHHYYYY HAVE PRIDE THE 3RD WEEKEND OF APRIL!!! its always hotter than hell and its just ridiculous to have it that weekend! its the same every freakin year only this year on saturday it hit like 105!!! is usually 98-99!!! walking around in that big ass dusty park for hours on end because HELLO WE ARE SUPPOSED TO BE SHOWING OUR PRIDE! lol....they need to consider having in MARCH! when the weather is still nice and people aren't dying from the heat! The crowd numbers would triple I think if they had they festival in March because everyone knows its cooler in March :-)",1
Stopped in after doing some shopping at Fashion Place. I loved the rock n roll music. We had the bbq chicken salad and my wife had the penne chicken pasta. Food and the service was good. We would go back next time in Scottsdale,2
"Hidden away from the strip of pubs on Lothian road towards fountain Bridge lies this massive pub.\n\nThe size of cargo makes it ideal for groups which was exactly the way I used it a couple of weeks ago.\n\nTo find a pub on a Friday night for a group of 40 isn't easy, but cargo was able to accommodate us without blinking,\n\nYou won't find any craft beers here, but you will find the usual lagers and dark beers on tap and a healthy collection of alcopops in the fridge.\n\nWe shared the pub with 3 hen do's a stag and a rugby group which meant that it was loud, very loud. The dj tried to drown out the crowd with music which meant the crowd had to almost yell at one another to hear above the music. \n\nWe arrived at 6 and by 8 we were the only group left which meant we could ask for the music to be turned down. Yes I know, we're mid thirties and we're that age where we'd prefer to hear each other speak!\n\nThey have a really nice outside area which is part of an area of Edinburgh that is going through regeneration, so it makes for a nice Sunday drink in the sun next to the canal.\n\nWe didn't try any of the food, but it seemed to be the usual pub faire. \n\nTwo stars from me as the atmosphere could be better and the music could certainly be lower.",1
"Fantastic food a little more authentic than a lot of places around here. Their enchilada sauce is amazing. The employees are very friendly. They could maybe use a little more filling in the enchiladas, for the price.",3
"Stayed at this Marriott while I was attending some training sessions at Epic. \n\nThe hotel has everything a modern hotel would have. The rooms and decor a bit dated, but that maybe because it's Wisconsin???\n\nThe rooms are good sized. The King single, had a king bed, a 32\"" LCD TV, ipod charging alarm clock, but a really small bathroom. I did have troubles with the heating during my stay here. It took the engineers two days just to get some heat into the room, and they continuously had to check on it while I was out during the day. \n\nThere is a breakfast buffet in the morning (not complimentary) and this is where you can have lunch/dinner or enjoy a drink at the bar. The bar had a good selection of local Wisconsin beers as well as your typical domestics. Bar tenders were super friendly and made the stay a little more enjoyable.\n\nIf you're a Marriott Reward member, be sure to have them add your access to the concierge lounge. Here they have free continental breakfast, snacks during the day, and a light meal at night. They have some type of honor system bar too in the evening. Also in the concierge lounge, you can use their computers for Internet browsing.",2
Huge line today but they got us through very quickly. They had four guys helping to build your burrito.  I love the fresh ingredients. Brown rice and chicken is the best but I've had the pork and steak and that's pretty good. Just love the chicken cause the spices and the grilling. Always perfect. \n\nTo top it off the servers were very friendly and smiling with a very clean environment. The only downfall of this Chipotle is the parking. Seems like the parking lot is always full. \n\nLove Chipotle. Burrito madness love it.,3
"I loved the food, but got violently ill the next day after eating the Diablo Burger.  Will not return even though it was good tasting because of the fear of that sickness again.  The food was the only food I had eaten in two days, so it can only be the thing that caused the illness sadly enough.  I ordered the Diablo medium and probably should have gotten it well-done.  For two people, it is easy to spend $50.00+ on two shakes, two burgers, and one fry.",2
Stopped by for lunch special.  Delicious. Had to take doggie bag home it was so plentiful.,3
"In one word: meh. I haven't done the whole Vegas buffet thing, so I don't have a lot to compare it to, but I keep hearing that the Wynn Buffet is the best. If this is the best, I'm afraid of what else is out there. The food was ok but not that good, and definitely not amazing. I did go to the lunch so there were no crab legs, etc., so maybe dinner is a whole other story. Maybe. But I think large buffets just tend to skimp a little on quality in favor of quantity regardless of when you eat.\n\nIf I hadn't won 2 free buffets I don't think I would have been happy paying the $22 + tax per person for lunch. What does make it worthwhile (if you love desserts) is the variety of good dessert selections.  Additionally, beverages are included, and if you get there early enough they will have fresh squeezed orange juice.\n\nThe Wynn buffet is probably the largest I've been too, but after circling the buffet twice, I only found a handful of items that looked appetizing enough to put on my plate. Of the things I ate:\n\nDECENT: Manhattan clam chowder, squid ceviche, mashed potatoes, grilled corn, salads, fresh fruit\n\nJUST OK: BBQ ribs, fried chicken--a little too sweet, cha siu bao (chinese pork buns), shu mai (dumplings)\n\nBAD: pasta--white sauce & cheesy kinds, white rice from the asian section\n\nAs for desserts, they all looked good. There are no dessert tasting restaurants where I live, so I love having the opportunity to try different sweets in one sitting. Overall, the desserts did not disappoint. \n\nBEST: caramel eclair\n\nGOOD: cheesecake, banana chocolate cake, madeleine\n\nOK: ice cream--a little eggy, carrot cake\n\nBAD: mini cupcakes--oily, not very flavorful, too much frosting\n\nEven though I enjoyed the desserts I don't think I'll be returning to the buffet. I think I would rather pay a little more and go to a restaurant where I know I'll get a good meal.\n\nFor info on skipping the line and free buffets via the Wynn Player's card (The Red Card) check out my review of the Wynn:\n\nhttp://www.yelp.com/biz/wynn-las-vegas-las-vegas#hrid:B9ZZ0mwHbb8nD4EgsDl-Kg",2
"We just ordered from this JJs for my office lunch (company orders from them and Milio's regularly because they're fast and deliver). It's been an hour since I received confirmation, so it's not living up the \""freaky fast\"" promise. We're all having to delay lunch until it gets here, so we're not super thrilled with this experience. I'll update on our next order, they're usually great.",2
"Came here for only two things. King crab & lobster and they had neither! Maybe since it was a Monday but still, if you are going to pay $40 for mediocre food like this I would've went with my first choice at the Rio. Thought this place would be nice and have a variety like the pictures and reviews. My husband and I were both very disappointed that it wasn't what we expected it to be especially thinking that it was at a high end hotel. Also waited forever for a refill on our drinks until my husband had to ask, then reading another fellow yelper's review, decided to check my glass cup & behold! It was filthy with water stains on it!! Regret coming here and spending $80+. Oh & BTW, prices are not $36 for Mon-Thurs. Went up to $40!! Never coming here ever again!",0
"Went on the final Friday, afternoon.  Only paid $5 to get in, half-price until 6; I thought that was fair (pardon the pun).  Found free parking along 17th Dr. about a block away after driving around for 15 minutes; I refuse to pay to park if I don't need to.  I wanted to go into the arena, where the Suns used to play to see inside, and I did sort of; the concourses were open but the doors to the main arena were locked.  It is only open during events and I didn't stick around for night's rap concert.  There were $1 food from noon-6 but only certain items and only small portions, again refuse to pay $7-8 for Italian sausage.  One booth had a chicken sandwich or something like that for $9.50 and you could make it a \""package\"" of fries and drink for an extra $5. Really?  I did find a stand that sold good-sized corn dogs for a $1 and got 2.. very good.  Another stand had miniature corn dogs for a $1 during the day.  Not too crowded, but got more so later in the day.  About half the size of the Indiana state fair grounds and both are in very questionable parts of town, especially at night.  Not near as many animals (types, numbers) as in Indy (no horses, sheeps), but lots of goats.  Beer is sold at the AZ fair but not in Indy during fair.  This is a been there, done that, cross off bucket list, etc. type of deal.",1
I am updating my review and increasing their score because they called me a coupe days ago and offered to make good on the $60 Black Friday deal they had originally backed out of. Thank you.,2
"The service here was fantastic.  I've never had someone pay such attention to detail when helping me package my leftovers (brought me new, sealed syrup; a \""to-go\"" cup for my drink; extra napkins...).  Of course I had to have the chicken and waffles for my first visit.  The chicken was great: fresh, flakey, & well-seasoned.  The waffles were crisp on the outside, moist on the inside, and tasted of cinnamon.  Yum.  They play fun music, too.  Great place.\n\nOnly downside was the unsweetened iced tea had a bit of a coffee flavor to me, and I don't like coffee (but they do have Splenda.  Nice.).",3
"Brewpubs tend to be my first target whenever I visit a new city. Great Dane happened to be a couple blocks away from the punk rock show we descended upon Madison for. I was stoked... until their beer touched my lips.\n\nIt is very, very difficult for me NOT to finish a beer, no matter the circumstances: bodily capacity, time constraints, ore even a little Armageddon. But I actually abandoned some of my Crop Circle Wheat because it had become unpalatable 2/3 through the very generous pour. I enjoy wheat and citrus-y beers, but couldn't manage to finish a glass of it. \n\nThe fact that a pair of fruit flies kept landing and launching off my lemon slice every sip didn't earn this brewpub any favors, either.\n\nNOM'd: Crop Circle Wheat",1
"Went there last night for a friends birthday, and probably won't be going back. They had one waitress working our table which is unheard of, since it was a table of about 15 ppl. She skipped over a couple people when it came to ordering and said \""I took orders from those who looked at me\"". Really? It took about 15 to get the first drink in hand. The food came out at a reasonable pace. The second drink I ordered took about 20 min to get! It was a beer at that. I ordered, waited about 6 min, my boyfriend went out to use a cigarette (which is about another 6-8 min) and when he came back in she came around the table again and he asked her about to drink and said was like oh ill get that right now. Another 7 min passes by and she finally brings it, and my boyfriend asks to see the manager. The manager comes over and asks what the problem is, my boyfriend explains and the manger proceeds to argue with him! The manger said we have not been waiting 20 min for a drink, that he saw the ticket time and it was put in 6 min ago, then he touches the beer and said it cold, if it were poured 20 min ago it would have been warm. RUDE! Bad service all around. And didn't resolve anything besides arguing with the customer and walking away!",1
Leaving a 1 star because I can't leave a 0 . This place is a joke and they never get my girls hair right . She's never coming back here they do not know how to color hair without messing up. Do not go here or you will regret it,0
"the restraunt was clean, great customer service, the reason why I gave it 2 stars was because while standing in line to order, the associate (Curtis) was working the register, taking money and cards, then he would rub his hands all over his face and his eyes, then ran his hands up and down the whole stack of regular cups!!! he did this 2 or three times while I was in line, I could not believe that. I would think someone working the register/cups would be more aware of what he is doing.",1
"A bit pricey for what it is. A bit more smoke and mirrors than actual quality. It is not a bad place. Food is good, but there are much better places close by that are a bit better. \n\nIf you need some pizza pretty quick and your and in the biltmore area, and you want a classy joing, then this is the place...\n\nhave fun",2
"More than I imagined here and 10 times better than that $1.00 Store associated with Wal Mart.  Sure they have plenty of things Made in China but they also have some quality products too.  Veggies, dairy items, and much more. This is a big store.\nAnd to think I only came here looking for those bags that extend the life of produce.",4
not bad for frozen yogurt but their toppings were old...i had to ask the person working to change the mochi,1
"This place is definitely a must see. Where else in town where you can see a light show under a canopy outdoors while you have your own preferred beverage and food and listen to free concerts, shop, dine and gamble in one spot.  Or where else you can zipline under a canopy of lights.  I only rate this place a 4 star out of 5 because I believe it needs more security or law enforcement officers to keep everyone safe and secure and help prevent homeless people from soliciting money or donations because it can hurt business.",3
"Ate here after looking for a breakfast place around Madison. It was in a strip mall but sometimes location doesn't matter for a good meal. This was NOT the case here.\nFrom the second we walked in and saw the FILTHY carpeting plus  the the two female hostesses with long, stringy hair and dirty clothes, we should have walked out. We stayed unfortunately and the waiter was dismal and rude. We wanted to order right away but he said, \""No, i will get you drink order first.\"" When we all just wanted water, he still refused to take our food order. After bringing us the water, then he took the order. Never experienced that ever before in a restaurant. Usually the wait staff cheerfully says, \""Oh you're all ready, sure, I can take your order.\"" Not this guy.The pancakes were tasteless and horrible. I kept asking myself, why didn't we turn around and walk out immediately? We all had pancakes and I ordered blueberry and he told me they were fresh. These were \""fresh\"" out of the freezer pack they came in. UGH - the food was not good. The place was dirty - sticky tables, filthy carpeting, sent back silverware that was dirty - the other location is supposed to be good in Fitchburg but please do yourself a favor and avoid this place. If you think the pancakes are good here, you have never had a good pancake!",0
Very bland soup.....and $5 for one iced tea. Won't be returning,0
"A couple co-workers and I decided to try this place for lunch today since we are working in the Downtown area.  At first, I wasn't sure what to expect.  I didn't realize Downtown and any decent places to eat like this but I was pleasantly surprised.\n\nArea - clean and next to the Mob Museum.\n\nFood - similar to fusion style.  I ordered the chicken Milanese torta.  Very tasty!  I enjoyed this very much.  It was a fairly good portion, however I thought the price was a bit steep.  $10.00 for my order, it came with a small side of chips but no drink.\n\nRestaurant - airy, clean, cafeteria style setting.  Many of the people working in the surrounding areas were having lunch there so this place would be good for a business luncheon.\n\nStaff - friendly.. not much more to say.\n\nMaybe when it's pay day or I feel like splurging a bit on bar-style food I'll make a trip back here.  I also want to try their happy hour.",2
"I have been to Tammy Coe on many occasions and I have to say, each time, it's a treat. The MJ cookie is my all time favorite, simply one of the best cookies I've ever eaten. \n\nThe mini muffins are fantastic, just the right size to try one or two or three or...\n\nEven if you're not into sweets, it's worth checking out the store just to see the artistry of the cakes. Each one is truly a work of art.",4
"The only reason I don't give 5 stars is because I don't want readers to expect perfection- but we loved our dining experience here. Tons of seafood on the menu, excellent appetizers, and very nice service. Our only complaint is that the wine list does not have an affordable option- nothing under $40. Entrees start at $20 and go up to $40 for their all you can eat fish bar. One friend got the fish bar- you go up and choose from 10 or more fresh selections of seafood and shellfish and they grill or steam your selection and bring it out with the other plates. Sides were delicious and served family style. This is off the beaten path so it wasn't too crowded or loud. The chairs were super comfy. There are lots of cute enjoyable touches like the way they serve bread and dessert- definitely worth dining there if you are looking for great seafood!",3
"Good spot to lounge and watch some games with drinks, but not a destination spot, per se. I'd either start the night or take a break here.\n\nGood 2-for-1 happy hour special.",2
So we gave it another Shot\n\nOrdered the Lunch Risotto. ( grrrrroooooosss) came with Bacon it was oily for 14$ i expect better Food\nCompared to olives Garden & Carrabas this Place doesnt offer Good Food any more. \nSems like they Changed the HH menu again. \nMy fav pizettas are gone.  \nI ordered the margherita flatbread which was so dry & Hard that you cant Cut it with the knive or Even Hold it to eat. Nearly impossible to eat. Dry dry dry & on the tomatoes oily   Who puts oil on a flatbread????\n\nThe Dessert : choc Lava cake was ok. Not very Good. Would Prefer a or One with ICE cream but was by far the best Part of our Lunch. \nCheescake was very Good. Tiramisu too\n\nDrinks. Ok but overpriced. \n\nWaiter & Bus Boys are very attentive & nice.  \nHost too. \n\nSo i will Not go back. We Tried it now so Many Times & for the Same price we had a 60$ Check for 2  i can eat anywhere Else.,0
"Overrun with people on Cinco de Mayo. That's not bad. Big gringo party night.\n\nWhat's bad? Weak cocktails in little 4-oz Dixie cups for $5.50. Starting a tab at one bar and needing to close it out when you go to another of the 4 bars inside because the cash registers don't talk to each other. No food service at any of the bars.\n\nSo probably not the best night to review the place, though I've been there several times over the years on non-\""holiday\"" nights, and it never really succeeds in impressing much--in any way, really. . .",2
"So \""Aloha\"" means both hello and goodbye -- now how can I work that into my review?\n\nHere goes:\n\nTo begin with it, I've never seen a combination bar and Hawaiian fast food place.\n\nAloha (Hello) Kitchen reminds me of a typical Hawaiian fast food place: well lit with a lot of cheesy decor.\nBesides having the basic plates, they also carried some unique stuff. I tried the Adobo Fried Rice and the wife tried the Saimin soup.  The food wasn't really anything to yelp about, but since it is a chain kinda place, you shouldn't expectation too much.\nI'd be willing to go back just because they serve poke (one of the items I don't find at a fast food place) on Friday and Saturday.\nSo until then, Aloha (Goodbye) Kitchen.\n\nAloha (Hello) Bar is right next door to the Kitchen but is a 180 from the Kitchen: dark with a dive feel to it.  But it still gave off the laid back Island life vibe.\nBartender was cool and even spoke to me in dakine.  Thanks.\nShe stopped though when my face went blank and didn't respond.  Sorry.\nThe music had the kinda beats I could groove to for a couple hours, and the crowd was chill.\nAfter a some drinks and a couple games of pool, I was saying Aloha (Goodbye) Bar.  Good thing since they just fired up the karaoke machine.\n\nOverall, I'll be saying Aloha (Hello) sooner to the Bar than the Kitchen.\n\nA special aloha to all the Vegas Yelpers from Hawaii.\nThere are a bunch.",2
"Great experience. They were able to come out within a day of my phone call, right on time, and the problem was fixed on the spot for a very reasonable price. $140 to change out both leaky shower valves in the bathroom. Sure, I could have done it myself, but I know it would have taken me forever to get around to it and it would have been a big pain for me. So I was happy to pay someone else who could do it in 30 minutes while I baked a birthday cake for my kid.",4
"I'm so glad I didn't pay to get in here. The event was really small and only had a few small aisles of booths plus some rides. We went on Sunday afternoon and there was no one there. It was hot out but I really wanted to eat some Asian cuisine. We perused the food booths but was turned off, I have no idea how long the food was sitting there. Not a lot of turnover going on with no one at the festival. We ended up leaving 10 minutes after we got there.",0
"Great place off the strip for Ramen.  Same as my review for Shuseki, it's a great ramen place.\n\nI'm not too much a fan of here as I am of the other place, but their food is good.  Their karage is different than what i'm used to, but their Ramen is fair.\n\nNot bad for their location.",2
"Move over Tesco Metro and Sainsbury's Local. This innocuous, neighbourhood 'convenience store' isn't so much a convenience store as a Super Wholefoods Health Food & Groceries Store. It has everything - everything you could possibly need. Oh wait, except supermarket own-brand microwave meals. I stand correceted, it has everything you could possibly need for making your own meals at home with fresh ingredients, organic options, and taking into account all food intolerances and choices (with vegetarian Linda McCartney sausages, to Organic Yeast-Free Stock cubes and gluten-free rice flour or Kelp Udon noodles).\n\nLocals who have already been into this store, but maybe not in a wee while - go back. It was only recently bought over. It's the same layout inside, but painted light blue on the outside now. You wouldn't even know it has changed hands, you may think the preivous owner just completely pulled his socks up. But now, it's new ownership. And wow, after speaking to the owner I can tell he's passionate about keeping the residents of Marchmont as well-stocked as possible.\n\nMy one suggestion would be to rename the store \""Jen's Store of Happy\"" as it has everything I could possibly need in to make me happy. All the brands that I often have to trawl across Edinburgh to seek out and buy. It's brought the teas of Jordan Valley together with the gluten-free flour and noodles of Real Foods, and has a really big fruit and veg section, with a new butcher section too for fresh meat.\n\nHere's a wee snippet of what I found when browsing:\n\nYogi Teas\nDorset Cereal Muesli\nDove Organic Gluten Free Flours\nDehydrated Kale Chips.\nKalo Stock Cubes\nNakd Snack Bars\nBiona 100% Rye Breads\nFresh fruit and vegetables\nNew butcher counter\nShelves upon shelves of grains and lentils\nShelves upon shelves of nuts and berries\nEcover cleaning products\nShelves upon shelves of pasta sauces, jarred vegetables\nRice noodles, kelp noodles, udon noodles\nA huge spice wrack with more spices than I've seen anywhere else\n\nI can't even begin to describe how much goodness is packed into the shelves here. It's like a supermarket you'd find in a French town, where microwave meals are unheard of and everyone cooks everything from scratch. Quite often health food and 'specialist food' stores are small in size and stock. But not Bodrum. It has the speciality but in vast quantity and range too.\n\nOk I'll stop gushing. But stepping in here made me immediately want to start cooking every single meal from scratch. And so I went home and made a green juice and snacked on kale chips. And it was good.I can honestly say I'll come here every few days for my groceries, and probably rarely frequent a supermarket in the area now.",4
"let me first say, I am not a coffee house kind of guy.  that being said I never would have reviewed this place had I been given a free refill on my iced tea.  but......since I was charged a buck I feel compelled to vent.  the only reason I wanted a refill is because the two pieces of toast I bought (for $3.99) were desert dry (and stale). nerds on their apples begging for attention is not my idea of a place I wanna hang.",0
Love the Belgium burger! The lamb inside is fantastic. The desserts are also great. They have a great many of beer collection! Love it,4
"Don't sign up for a free pass as they do not honor them if you get in before 9am.  I think when someone has the intent of signing up for your gym and asks for pricing, etc its best to not turn $$ away. Oh well. Just wanted to warn everyone else about the free pass scam so you don't waste your time. Im sure they honor it if you can go to the gym during business hours when its most convenient :) \n\nI will never consider 24 hour fitness as a gym option again, hope you agree.",0
A nice restaurant. Waitress was great. Food was good. A mistake was made on my mom's order but was fixed right away. A very pleasant experience.,4
"I adore most of the Rachel's Kitchens, especially the one located on Ogden. So, I go to this one near my home. We just ordered online for pick up. My husband was very upset with this order. They completely forgot one of two salads. The girl behind the counter was quite rude when asked when the missing salad would be ready as it was taking such a long time. She just ignored my husband. Ummm, you forgot an entire entree for crying out loud, why the attitude. What's more, we ordered ahead. I may just stop going to this particular location. I can go without the snobbery.",2
"This place was terrible from the second we walked into our room. I booked through Travelocity - a standard room for two adults. This equals a room with one full size bed. When I went down to ask if there had been a mistake - since we needed two beds - I was told that's what I had booked. I don't like arguing with people in customer service, since they're just doing their job - but i did ask him to check again since I would have never booked a single bed room. I was told that I had probably \""not paid attention, and clicked wrong.\"" Yeah - that's what happened... OR you have a very misleading policy, and didn't actually save the room i booked 3 months in advance.. This wasn't ever resolved, and my friend has to sleep on the pull out couch for 3 nights. That was the biggest gripe, and perhaps it tainted the rest of the experience. But really, this hotel is kind of gross. It's on par with a nice hostel (if you want to be nice) - yet you're paying a hotel rate. Everything outside of the lobby is super depressing, the elevator requires you to swipe your card each time (was there seriously a problem where people were abusing elevator usage???), the air conditioning in the rooms does not work properly (feels like a damp/humid high 70s at all times), the signs that say ice machine on each floor are taped over since there is actually only one, in the lobby (decided we didn't want ice that bad to go back to our room to get the card to use the elevator to get the ice......), there are also two stains on the couch, a dishwasher but no dishes (what's the point??? just so you can say rooms are so well equipped, they even have a dishwasher??), and elevators that don't work/ have call buttons but are annoyingly much closer than the ones that are functioning. Heads up, there's also a $50 deposit upon check-in.... you get it back as long as you dont acquire extra charges - but still, it wasn't mentioned at all during my booking process. \n\nPROS: free wifi, free continental breakfast (though they really should label their \""egg dish\"" - had ham in it... also, would be nice if there was a sans ham option), good water pressure, location. \n\nBottom line - I would never stay here again and would recommend friends avoided it as well. For strangers, if the rates at this hotel are SIGNIFICANTLY cheaper than the dozens of others in the area - sure, go for it. But if it's a $10 - $20 difference, I wouldn't bother risking the quality of my vacation because of a low-rate hotel.",0
BEST stake for under $20,4
I have been going here for a few months and had great service; I just wish they could offer manicures on Friday evenings. \n\nThe stylists are very nice and I get a great haircut at a good price; it took me two years to replace the stylist who left another place I was a patron of before and I finally found Shelly at The Loft.,4
"When we checked in I requested an upgrade, all they had were double queens for my husband and I.  The clerk seemed relieved when I requested the upgrade, she said the upgrade would be a \""much\"" better room.  She gave us an option of pool \""view\"" or outside view.  I asked her opinion, the clerk said pool view would be much better.  Our room was nothing like the photo; it was 3rd floor, very dated, the view was the backside of the satellite dishes.  The casino was constantly under construction, and the information desk was absolutely no help with questions regarding activities outside the hotel.  We attempted dinner at the \""Steak & Seafood\"" restaurant and found we could not get into the restaurant without a reservation(the restaurant was half empty).  When we arrived back at our room at 7:30 this evening, no set up(maid service).  I gave the hotel 2 stars because the room was clean.  This hotel has no ambience, very boring, the pool has dead grass around it....we attend conventions twice a year in Las Vegas and will not be returning for another visit to the Riviera",1
Slow service. Mediocre food.,1
"Came here on a saturday night with a filipino friend.  The place has a small filipino bakery with decent varieties of goodies.  We ordered sisig, pork sinegang, dinuguan.  It was good! on saturday night, this place will have a line dance and on friday night, they will have a filipino live band music playing in the restaurant.  It was fun and definitely will go back!",3
Country style! Good food...,3
"I spent a lovely week here at Lifetime on a free trial pass. I LOVED this gym and I didn't feel a ton of pressure to join (although be warned, when you're on a trial pass you DO have to check in with your sales person every day before working out). This is by far the cleanest gym I've ever been too, and the locker rooms are spacious, with clean towels and soap in the showers provided. Being a casual swimmer, I particularly appreciated the water-removal system for bathing suits and the plastic bags provided to store your still-damp suit in. \n\nThey also have TONS of machines, ample treadmills, and a massive amount of classes. \n\nThe downside? It costs $100 a month for a couple to join -- which is ultimately why I didn't sign on. It's just a little too expensive for my meager budget, but if I had the cash, this would be the place I'd spend it.",3
"As if Oakville Grocery and West Elm alone aren't enough to keep me hooked on the Scottsdale Quarter, the recent opening of Primebar, the new 'contemporary ale house', gives me even more reason to make my way back.\n\nKiller cocktails and tons of local beers on tap, they have great happy hour specials...$3 Drafts, $5 Wine, $6 Specialty Cocktails (Monday-Friday, 4-7PM).\n\nThey have 15 specialty cocktails to choose from (love the names 'Dirty CEO Martini' and 'Silly Goose') but my favorite was the Peartini - refreshing and light with the use of St. Germain and Grey Goose La Poire, Pear Juice and Prosecco...topped off with a slice of pear.\n\nA great lineup of draft beers - some classic, some local. Local drafts include beers from Tempe's finest Four Peaks, Oak Creek Brewing from Sedona, Nimbus Brewing from Tucson and Prescott brewing from....well....Prescott.\n\nWe ordered a few dishes to share, among them the beet lollipops coated in candied pistachios served with a goat cheese dipping sauce (who doesn't love the new lollipop trend that's going on?), apple wood smoked bacon sliders, sweet potato fries, bbq chicken flatbread (excellent!) and the beet salad with arugula, mandarin oranges, pistachio brittle, roasted beets and goat cheese.\n\nThe setting was nice. Very spacious dining area yet cozy with the use of dark leathers and wood. The \""eye\"" artwork on the wall was interesting and couldn't help but notice the use of old school light bulbs in the chandelier (think Olive & Ivy) which sealed the deal for being casual.\n\nI was a little bummed to find out it was a chain (with other Locations in Colorado, Florida, Illionois, and Missouri) but it's one of those chains that don't feel like chains (like Gordon Biersch) - so I'll definitely be back!",3
"This review is for the grab and go section only.  My friends and I ordered 2 banana splits. They were 12 bucks each. Not only did they take 20 min to give is our banana splits... When we received them they were melted and dripping everywhere. And dripped on our clothes.\n\nThey seemed understaffed in the kitchen section.\n\nBut come on.. Don't give me melted ice cream when I dropped 12 bucks on it. \nAnd at least apologize... Don't just hand it to me and act like I ordered melted ice cream. \n\nI hate leaving bad reviews, but this was just unacceptable.",1
"I went for the pork belly tacos and they were sold out! Noooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo.\n\nI got the bone marrow instead and it was wonderful. It was my first time trying bone marrow. The toast points were a bit burnt. I loved the pickled thing served with it. Pimento? Not sure.\n\nAlso got the bahn mi and didn't notice any foie gras p\u00e2t\u00e9 on it. I mentioned it to someone behind the bar and they told me it isn't on the bahn mi. But it said it on the menu... They checked the menu, looked at me and said \""oh yeah, it is.\"" And then just turned around and went back to what they were doing. Dang?\n\nThe Manhattan they made me was really good. I didn't realize how good until about a week later, when I had an almost vomit inducing Manhattan in Georgia. (And the most bullshit Tom Collins.) Those dark cherries were perfect. It was a slightly spicier Manhattan, which I loved.\n\nThe bartenders here, yes please. Wait, what?",4
The hot dogs were good. They have a wide variety.  There bacon cheeseburger is great. Fast service however I had to refill my own drink. The waitress just pointed to the machine and said she was too busy. That was a bummer. But as far as taste goes.......they get a 3 star.,2
Food is good. I had chicken wings. They were breaded (did not say breaded on menu). They are the drumstick part only. Good sized drumsticks but fatty. A little too fatty for my taste. Too much fat makes them slimy under the skin. I would not order them again. Service was good. Nice servers working their butts off. Steve had the Standard Dawg. It was huge!!! He liked it a lot.,2
"Sehr trendige Location und Karlsruhe tut so ein bischen Gro\u00dfstadtflair mal ganz gut. Vom Ambiente kann da auch nicht der Paris Plage mithalten, nimmt man mal die Seine aus der Wertung :-)\n\n\n Preise und Angebot an Getr\u00e4nken und Essen finde ich sehr gut und passend. Alles in allem k\u00f6nnte man dort wirklich sch\u00f6ne Abende verbringen.\n\n\n Leider ist der Service meiner Meinung nach nicht optimal und das kann einem den Abend vermiesen. Die Getr\u00e4nke brauchen ewig und an der Bar geht es auch nicht schneller, wenn man sich selbst versorgt. Eine Servicekraft f\u00fcr den kompletten Abschnitt zwischen Loungebereich und Auffahrt zum Parkdeck ist an warmen Abenden einfach zu wenig.\n\n\n Mein Fazit: Trendig, tolles Ambiente und ab und an einen Besuch wert. Wenn man aber auf guten Service wert legt und entspannt chillen will, wird man unter Umst\u00e4nden entt\u00e4uscht werden.",2
"Since I've been to PR, their menu has changed for the better. Today I enjoyed lunch with friends. Service was good and the food was good-not spectacular but good. I had the curry chicken salad sandwich. I asked for not toasted but it came sort of toasted (or maybe it was just dry?) The kale salad was really flavorful but I detected the tell tale grit of greens not washed properly. Kitchen staff: please don't trust the greens you get from your food supplier Wash them!\nMy friend's food was good-the fries were especially good. The collards not so good. The salmon burger got good reviews.",2
"I hate this place, so many military here and they do so much to screw you over. If you want to renew your lease they raise the rent, neighbors are loud and ghetto and like others have said it's terrible\nTo get parking. Pool is full of kids with nobody watching them.",0
"I stopped in here to find a supplement that the Muscle Max store next to Gold's didn't have. My husband likes Hi Health because he says it's cheaper than GNC. \n\nI went in and found the employees to be very helpful and friendly (without being over-bearing). The store offers a buy one get the second half off for many things in the store, every day. Pretty cool. It wasn't valid on my supplement but was for the liquid vitamin I bought. \n\nWhen I cashed out, the girl gave me some good tips on my supplement that I didn't know before, so I really appreciated that.",2
"The menu looks awesome and the dish concepts are good except everything that comes out is disappointingly bland. Thank god there were bottles of hot sauce and salt on the table. The best part of the meal was the peanut butter chocolate milk shake. The burger and \""spicy\"" Cajun soup were very mediocre.",1
"Great food and great service, the pricing is not nearly as high as you would expect for the view, ambiance and the fact that it's right on the strip. Everything I have tried has been very fresh, flavorful and delicious. If you are looking for a place to have a nice dinner without paying an arm and a leg, also getting a great view- this is it!",4
"I recently went on a weekend trip to Scottsdale with a couple of friends and we stayed at the Hyatt Place-- AWESOME HOTEL!  The rooms, lobby and amenities are all new and modern.  Each room is a suite and consist a 42' HDTV plasma, two beds, a sectional couch (w/fold out bed), huge living room area, fridge, office desk and free wireless.  The pool was great and the water was the perfect temp-- not too cold, not too warm.  This place is great, and its located right in the heart of old scottsdale so you can literally walk to all the local bars and clubs.  you know what that means.....unlimited pre-gaming!  We also got free continental breakfast every morning.  and best of all, the room was only $89/night.  And since our room fit 3 people comfortably it was a great value to say the least.  If you ever find yourself in scottsdale, this is the place to stay.",4
"I've stayed here twice, the first time was at the tail end of my honeymoon and after being in the tropics with bugs and all, I was ready to be pampered. The room was super clean and I just loved how you can go to the FS pool or Mandalay's pool. However, I would suggest settling yourself down in the FS pool since they help you find a seat, cover your chair, bring you water and occasionally they bring little complimentary treats out to the pool goers. Plus it doesn't feel nearly as crazy busy as the Mandalay pools. I would definitely stay here during the summers. This second time staying here I don't think we sprung for as expensive a room so though it was nice and clean, the TV, vanity and such were very much outdated. Wished they would redecorate the rooms a bit. Other than that it's a very nice hotel with amazing service.",3
"Where was this place before on my trips to LV.!?! Liking the concept of small plates, about 3-4 little pieces on each plate. Yeah tapas style isn't revolutionary but for this town it's a great addition. Very fun selection of plates. Like the pb&j with peach jam and cut in rounds. Great vibe, smart variety of big/small tables, dimly lit yet colorful and great for interesting drinks and conversation. Its what alot of us envision as real Vegas atmosphere. If you're a fan of First Food at Venetian, you'll appreciate this little spot near the new Hard Rock area. \n\nJust a disclaimer: please don't be disappointed with \""simple\"" food at high prices. There's a level of quality here, not mounds of food to just fill up and overeat. If buck bang is more desirable, just head over to cheap buffets or 25-cent hot dogs at Harrahs.",3
"Fail for the Travelzoo deal.  Paid $99 for the voucher, which was to include full dinner for 2.  What they failed to mention was the restaurant would make you pay tax & 20% gratuity on the \""retail price\"" of the offer ($320+).  So this $99 groupon-esque deal actually ended up costing $200.  Oh, and the food sucked.",0
"I went here on Wednesday night.  I had read the reviews on Yelp and wasn't sure what to think.  Anyway since it was our first night in Vegas, me and my girlfriends figured we wanted to try a small bar/lounge.  It was definitely a chill spot.  It was fairly empty but they had good music and the beers were reasonably priced.  Definitely a good spot to go to on a first date or if you're looking for a relaxing evening with good music and drinks :)",2
"The only good thing about this dining experience was the actual taco. The rest of the food was blah, including my cocktail (beans, rice, chips, dip)\nThe restaurant wasn't full, but was so loud that it was hard to have a conversation. Our waiter wasn't very friendly or forthcoming with service (we had to ask for water and then leave the money on the table because he was busy talking to coworkers)\nI picked Pasqual's because it seems to be a favorite of a lot of Madisonians but I can't figure out why. I wouldn't recommend it!",1
"Drinks were good and reasonable....Meal was good but hate it when everything is a   \""side.\""  Good Steak but was disappointed in the chile mac'n'cheese.  Good service and a nice place.",2
"After reading mostly affirmative reviews, I must of been pretty high in the coocoo's nest when I ate there! Okay, possibly the service could be entitled to a three star stamp. I had the Mole and Chicken Enchilada. The poultry was desiccated and the corn tortilla was eloquently not house made nor fresh. My partner's dish came out of the microwave. \n\nI will go back to make a clearer assessment because the disparity margin is quite large between my review and everybody else's.",0
Greatest tailor in Scottsdale! Just brought Phil two pairs of pants that I needed shortened since I am going to Vegas in two days.  He had me in and out the door in thirty minutes.  Great service at a great price.,4
"Requiring fortification prior to heading out for some adult beverages, some smoked meat goodness was in order! Tipped off by local yelper, Risa (thank you) this place was the  bizomb!!!!   Witness lone waitress Anna exclaim, \""I work hard for my money, I get no break!\""  Classic!  When in Montreal...  Smoked medium sammich special with poutine /dill pickle and slaw did not disappoint.",4
"Went here during Fringe before a modest mouse concert-\n\nHad gotten used to great fish n chips during the entire trip from Edinburgh to Highlands to Inverness to Skye to Oban & back to Edinburgh, but I think the best I had was here.  \n\nChoice of multiple fish in the fish n chips- the two we had, I believe the haddock and the cod, were great!  Perfectly crispy outside but moist and tender interior.\n\nAlso there was a pretty decent wine selection at very reasonable prices.  I think we had a good New Zealand Sauv Blanc to wash the meal down.\n\nSeveral other sides, all excellent- seemed like the restaurant took their job seriously, but the location and decor was really cool with a very memorable wallpaper (you'll understand when you go!).\n\nAlso I love waiters who are friendly & into the restaurant and the menu and aren't afraid to give good recommendations.  We got some great recs here courtesy of the waiter!",3
"No worries Michael N., Dan C. had to explain the Festivus reference to me (it had been a while since I've gotten my last dose of Seinfeld).\n\nA night of holiday fun-ness that only Yelpers and the Charlotte Yelp Community can have.  I haven't been to IOS Greek Kitchen yet, but they have a great space, and they were such great hosts to shut the entire place down just for us.  Servers were on point!  At one point, I had to stop the server and tell her that she was doing TOO GOOD a job since there was never a time where I didn't have a drink in hand or she was asking me if I needed another.  Food was great - fresh veg... loved the hummus - I pretty much licked my plate clean (hopefully no one saw that - if they did, my apologies).\n\nThere was a CRAZY pile of toys in the corner - The yelp community always pulls through with great donations.  I meant to ask Nikki if she needed help carrying all that stuff to her vehicle, but the aforementioned drinks above turned me into an inconsiderate person that just needed to take himself home.\n\nLoved seeing some familiar faces... and the... holiday... attire.  I guess that's what so great about the holiday since \""holiday attire\"" can mean so many things to different people.  Bruce K. deserved the win (risking electrocution all for the sake of Yelp).  Nice to meet a lot of new faces too.\n\nNikki - Amazing event (as always) and you didn't burn the chocolate!  Thanks for the shout out about my closing (so relieved!).\n\nTonya - thank you for documenting!  I love the fact that you took so many pictures that your battery died.  Love me some PopRock Photography - in fact I was thinking about trying to make up an event just so I can hire you.\n\nDan C. - sorry about all the BooBirds...  We only booed you because we don't want you to move away!  You will definitely be missed.\n\nA great way to end 2014 and it just makes me look forward to all the fun that is in store for 2015.",4
Excellent beer menu and beer flights. Still allows cigars in the bar. I had the muffaletta they have the meats right but the bu and olive spread are not really well suited for a muffaletta sandwich. They would be better off calling it an Italian sandwich. The fries were awesome and the service was excellent.,2
"This was a treat a fiesta in my mouth with delicious. \""All shit was good\"" it was good from start to end. Would love to come here again and try the chief specials. Very nice chief, he came out to greet us while we complimented his wonderful exploring work.  Everyones tastes buds and bellies were 100% happy :)",4
"We just had our worst experience ever today. Our large family group decided to try this new restaurant for brunch. After ordering, it took an hour and a half to get our food. Even then, the food came out a few dishes at a time with about 10-15 minutes in between serving! Awkward when half the table has food and the other doesn't!  The bread on toasted sandwiches was burnt, the potatoes were undercooked, and one meal wasn't even the \""Special\"" the person ordered because \""they ran out!\""  The wait staff and even the manager had nothing but excuses and blamed the kitchen staff. This establishment is very poorly managed to say the least. I would not recommend this eatery to ANYONE.",0
"They're okay with training, but not very accommodating.  My two dogs were enrolled in an agility class and on the 2nd week I went into pre-term labor.  Dog's Best Friend was unwilling to allow us to attend any future classes - we didn't want a refund - we just wanted an opportunity to fulfill our training.  I was very disappointed.",1
So their website advertised something and they didn't have it...ordered fries and no ketchup in order.i called and they wouldn't make the order correct. I won't go back,0
"Anytime my husband and I want a romantic date or a great place to socialize with our friends over a great dinner, Olives is the place we go in Las Vegas.  The balcony overlooks the Bellagio fountains, so not only do you get a fabulous dinner but the view is spectacular.  As for price- the value doesn't get much better than Olives...  Less pricey than most places on the strip, Olives offers predictably good food at an affordable price.  The beef carpaccio appetizer melts in your mouth.  Butternut squash is one of my favorite dishes.  This past weekend, I had the shrimp crusted pacific swordfish and lump crab beignets.  Balcony seating is first come first serve.  The secret?  Make a fairly early dinner reservation (between 5-7).  Arrive 30-45 minutes early and let the hostess know you'd like to sit outside and ask if they can put you on the list while you enjoy a drink in the bar.  It works every time.",3
Mgm grand is overated.  Check in takes about an hour.  They charge you a 28 dollar per night resort fee.  The rooms were nice but noisy and loud we were on the 25 th floor and could hear sirens and cars on the atrip.  The a/c doesnt cool the room down enoigh even at its lowest temperture level.,2
"I like this place.  From the first time I tried it out, everyone has been friendly and have introduced themselves.  The people at Keegan's on Camelback learned my name right away and know what I like.  They make sure I'm happy to be there. Even when they're busy, my orders go straight back to the kitchen or to the bar and I'm served before I know it.  It's high quality, delicious food and the portions are perfect (MOAB or filet, med rare & fresh small plate salad ... killer).  Good prices, comfortable atmosphere and easy going clientele.  I would bring anybody here.",3
"Service was good but food was average, prices were high compared to other PHO houses.",1
"I have been to the Swaddee in Chandler and know they do phenomenal sauces and pretty good food so, I was really looking forward to experience Swaddee in Scottsdale.  I had the exact same dish I get at their Chandler location - the red curry.  The sauce was meh, not so much.  Unfortunately the food definitely did not measure up and I think there are much better Thai places in the Valley.",1
"My new favorite place for Sunday brunch! Cozy atmosphere and dinning environment, and friendly waitresses, and especially they have very tasty food (my friend and I ordered The biscuits and gravy and Ploughman's breakfast, YUM!!!), all these are enough for you to walk in and enjoy. There were three musicians playing live classical music during our brunch time, wonderful experience at this place! PS. I love their decor and furniture, vintage and Irish style.",4
"Besides finding GLASS in our butter, the service was very slow and food was not worth the price. For their selections and quality of the food, the menu would be better suited at the $15-20 range and not high $20's-30's.\n\n In addition, our reservations were incorrectly made and the waiter was extremely skiddish and unknowledgable about the food.Furthermore, when we notified management of the glass in our food- the bar manager promised someone would call me the next day to 'right their wrong.' \n\nThree days later I called and after being hung up on, I finally spoke with John, he asked me what I wanted after I explained who I was. After I told him I was promised Bonterra would 'right this wrong,' he then tried to pass the glass of as ROCK SALT. I told him, 'uh, no. it was not rock salt, i can tell the difference. besides, rock salt would not cut my gum.' Finally, he offered a refund or gift certificates-- I accpeted the refund. John told me it would take 36 hours to process. A week later, still no refund was processed. I again had to contact Bonterra. John emailed me back: \""We do not have access to your full credit numbers and exp date. We were waiting to hear from you so we could process.\"" Bonterra has my cell phone number, my husband's cell phone number and both of our email addresses.\n\n I was quite surprised by the complete lack of urgency and pure laziness by the owner. I guess, if I were running a business and someone found glass in my food, I would act hastily to make sure my customer's image of my restaurant is not tainted.\n\nNow, not only is there a cut in my gum left from my experience at Bonterra, there is also a bitter taste in my mouth.",0
"I went here recently with my husband and a friend of ours. We all really liked Avalon, which was recently housed in this location, so we were looking forward to trying Sevens'. I can't remember the last time I had an experience this bad at a restaurant in the Valley. It was Saturday night and there were only a few people at the bar and a table full of very drunk and very loud college football fans. \n     We  sat down and ordered a round of drinks and our meals. They have a decent selection of draft beers and cocktails. My friend ordered an italian greyhound and it was just okay. The menu stated the drink had basil in it and it did, but for 9 dollars and for a \""speciality\"" drink one would expect a muddle of fresh basil, not a few shakes of dried basil from a jar. After awhile we realized we had waited almost 45 minutes and our food still had not arrived. The table of college football fans had barely just gotten their food. So we waited, the server came over and told us there was a backup in the kitchen and our food would be out soon. So we waited more, not a single plate was coming out of the kitchen. We waited a little more, after about an hour of waiting our food came. I had the jalapeno burger, my husband the cioppino, my friend the short ribs.\n    The food was OK, my burger was good, but not definitely not worth the wait. My husband said the seafood in his cioppino was good, but the tomato sauce was really bland and took away from the dish. My friends short ribs looked really sad, she said they were tender but lacked flavor, there was no sauce and the dish was really flat. Her veggies were practically raw. Definitely not worth the 20 dollar price tag. \n  When the server brought our food she acknowledge the long wait and said she notified the owner, who has been sitting at the bar all night. She let us know she was trying to get him to offer a free dessert. Gee, how generous. The biggest disappointment was that the owner/manager never came to speak to us or apologize. He sat at the bar. I understand things happen, but show some professionalism, show your customers you care about their experience. \n   When the server came to clear our plate she let us know if we wanted dessert it would be on the house, almost a non-gesture since the last thing we wanted to do was wait some more. She brought our check and i was taken back by the 82 dollars total. Charging 7 bucks each for a draft beer, wow.\n  I really wanted to like this place, it is in such a nice space and has good atmosphere. The mediocre food, poor service and lack of management will keep me away.",0
"I'd heard good things about the place from a couple of people so I wanted to give it a try and I wasn't disappointed.  Nice vibe in the place, friendly people and tasty food!  I went with the intention of picking something up over my lunch hour but I ended up making a new friend and we sat and talked about food.\n\nI believe it was the owner up front, she was friendly and passionate about the place.  I went with the 1/2 Mediterranean veggie sammy and 1/2 Wanted Panda salad (they were out of the Mediterranean bean salad).  The sammy was plump full of fresh & tasty veggies, homemade hummus on a nice toasty grain bread.  The salad was big and also very fresh, loved the tangy/sweet dressing - with a proper serving size of about 2 Tbsp THANK YOU!  (hate having a nice salad dripping with 1/3 cup of gooey dressing)  \n\nI thought both items had a nice amount of flavor and the veggies tasted like they'd spent a good amount of time in the earth as they should. I finished off with a Cliffs of Dover fruit juice blend, was a little sweeter than I expected but that was just fine with my sweet tooth.  $15 total for my lunch, and I was full & satisfied for the entire afternoon.\n\nMy new friend went with the falafel burger and it looked so good, nice and moist and she loved the sauce.  Another customer asked her what it was because it looked so tasty.  I'd just made falafel the day before or I'd have gone with it - oh well, next time.  The other burgers sound great too!\n\nI noticed some reviews commenting about 24C being out of different things, as they were when I went.  With a varied daily menu with fresh ingredients its hard to anticipate so I don't fault them for that.  \n\nI'll definitely be back again.  Yes it's a bit pricy, takes a little longer and the food might be a little different each time.  And thats fine by me.   This place reminded me why we don't like chains and delicious food and great conversation go so well together.",3

"Stopped by for a bite to eat for lunch. My mother ordered the quiche special and I ordered the house salad with French mustard dressing. We\nalso had a delicious baguette, mine with goat cheese and my mothers was plain.The food is of very high quality; very fresh with delicate flavors. The portions were so generous we couldn't fit in dessert. It is a shame as the desserts looked sublime.",3
"I have never had good luck with this company.  Though deliveries occasionally show up, they frequently lie about the status of shipments.  More than once they have claimed to have attempted delivery when someone was at home (and they left no tag at the door.)  They have also claimed to not be able to find addresses in San Francisco.  (GPS?  Any number of online map services? Ask someone on the street?)  I also suspect that the 5-star review is an inside job.  This company needs to be put out of business.",0
All I can say is Perfect!  I come to Montreal for business from California......it is now a necessity that I dine at this restaurant each time i come here.  There is nothing I can complain about...... Barroco is just fabulous!,4
The food is good- but it is overpriced for what you get.,2
"Nem Nuong Bistro is a new place to try a variety of Spring Rolls, the place has a great purpose, but I feel the food is lacking a little. I would like to see an improvement on their dishes before I come back. I guess it's a decent vietnamese restaurant, but it's not anything special to me. I give them credit on their service though because most vietnamese restaurants have terrible service and here, their employees are quick and organized. But other than that, their food isn't worth my money.....",2
"Went here when it newly opened...so dont remember much. We grabbed drinks at the bar area, and they gave us samples of their Wood Grilled Thin Crust Pizza....and that's what drew us in. Their apps/sides are good, but the steaks are ok. Whenever I crave for pizza I always think of Brand!",1
"This place is misleading.  Wineburger is a great concept and name, but the place is nothing more than a strip mall burger joint.  Like other reviews, it's 95% bar, 5% restaurant with a cheers type atmosphere. \nWent on a Wednesday night and all the TVs were on a infomercial channel.  When I asked if they could put something else on, the middle aged Persian bartender told me that the cable was out and somehow we were stuck with a P90x drone .  Another flaw, the ventilation is so poor that you smell like you actually  fried the burgers on your stovetop. \nMany better places in Phoenix",0
"Wow, how the LA counterpart allows this place to keep using the Pink's name is beyond me.  The first time I went when it opened I was like meh.  The second time I went last month I was like wth!!!  I don't see this place lasting with it never having people there it seems.  The chili is pretty spot on to being the same as well as the dogs but man everything else is just horrible.  I mean I got a crusted tortilla wrapper that was litterarly cracking and breaking as if it was a cracker.  It's almost like they left the tortilla sitting on the counter all night and decided to use it anyways.  I mean if you are going to bring a prized LA landmark like this to LA then do it right.  I mean In-N-Out and Tommy's do it right.  It's just a downright shame for Pink's.",0

Good Stuff- Very precise and warm place,4
"My hubbie and I are foodies.  This food was an enormous let down.  We had the baby back rib dinner with coleslaw, cowboy beans and sweet potato pie.  i'll start with the pie.  If you are picturing a nice, normal size piece of pie you will be disappointed.  If you are familiar with the miniature, 3-inch BAMA pecan pies from gas station stores, this is exactly what you get -- a 3-inch disposable pie tin with a dark mixture in it resting on what looks like pressed brown sugar (not crust) but isn't sweet.  The filling itself was very mediocre.\n\nOnto the coleslaw.  Like so many other reviews I have now read about their food, it is the strangest tasting coleslaw we have ever tasted.  It had an overwhelming flavor of some spice that is just not compatible with barbeque.  It tastes like medicine.  We could not identify if it had mint, tarragon or cilantro in it--or all three but it was overwhelming.  (Imagine the taste of mint or licorice with barbeque--yuck!  No way is this \""Southern coleslaw.\""   I have lived all over the South and have never had this weird flavor, medicine tasting coleslaw.\n\nOnto the babyback ribs.  first,, I do want to say that they are very good quality, meaty babybacks.  The problem is that they are not being properly prepared.  First if all, any chef or good home grillmaster knows you should always strip the layer of sinew off the back of each rib bone before cooking.  This was not done.  When my husband grills them, they fall off the bone.  These were wet like they had just come out of a wet steamer pan or were just boiled but not baked or grilled thereafter.  When we bit into them, we had to tug hard to even pull the rib meat off the bone.  My husband, in utter frustration, created an aluminum foil tent over them, slathered them with the extra barbeque sauce we had ordered and baked them at 350 degrees for over an hour.  Then the rib  meat came right off the bone without the slightest chewiness.  Moral of this part of the story:  they are either being way undercooked or no other process besides boiling is being used.\n\n\nIt was the owner himself who cooked our food and delivered it to us (and he forgot our cornbread which we only discovered later).  The shame of it all is that he is investing in very meaty good quality rib, but clearly is not a true chef and (I hate to sound insulting) but he needs cooking & grilling lessons.  And he needs to read these reviews, like all the complaints about the weird cole slaw, and be responsive by making changes.  If I were him, I'd add warm applesauce with apple chunks or slices and maybe corn pudding or a corn side of some sort, change the slaw to a traditional apple vinegar & sugar dressing or mayo based dressing, invest in real whole pies and offer slices that at least SEEM like they were baked there--and watch some online videos on how to properly bake/grill or smoke babyback ribs.  He seems like a nice guy so I hate to see him not make it.  But if Gordon Ramsey stopped by, he'd tell him the same thing!\n\nI did like the cowboy means although the texture was very close to the mashed pinto beans you get with Mexican food (i.e. overcooked).",0
"We were staying at the Westin and it was late and the Original Fish Market was right on site. Well the experience at both the hotel and the restaurant was dismal. We waited too long to be seated and the hosted seemed to have attitude when we asked one of the servers to find her. A simple \""Sorry for the wait\"" would have been nice. We were about to leave after waiting 15 mins for a waiter. Unfortunately we did not.  The food was all bland and tasteless. Oh! Except for the bold taste of Obay on the fries. I had blackened rainbow trout.  I expected a bold favors but yet nothing. It was not even blackened.  Looked like paprika for color, but that was it.  Mash potatoes were dry and tasted gritty like it came from a box. We skipped dessert for obvious reasons. I am not adverse to paying top dollar for a great meal. I hate paying top dollar for a lousy meal that I could have done better myself.\n\nDo yourself a favor and avoid the Original Fish Market.  I was generous to give one star.",0
Great! You'll eat until you hurt. We go out of our way to eat here each time we are in Vegas. Get Ruben and chicken noodle soup.,4
I am from California & this is the worst steak house. I will compared this to Sizzler Restaurant.,0
"Dr Stewart has no bedside manners.  I informed the office to pls not mention the word surgery around my daughter, because my daughter freaks out big time due to all the surgeries that she has had, and the idiot kept mentioning surgery.  Of course, my daughter starts to get scared and freaks out and then the dr just looks at her like she is crazy.   Has no sympathy or compassion...will not go see him ever again",0
"The ambience is great. Young, hip and trendy. My wife and I have dined at Nine Steakhouse several times and have enjoyed every dinner. The servings and desserts are great, especially the Smores. \n\nThe ambience is great and trendy, imagine the HBO show \""Entourage.\"" Nine Steakhouse is a must when in Vegas.",3
"Closed... GONE UNDER, OUTTA HERE.. See ya later, bye bye..",0
"My wife literally applauded after eating the mac and cheese.\n\nAmazing ribs (spare/beef/baby back), chicken and links.  For sides, we typically do a double of the mac & cheese.  Giant cups of Muddy Waters (Sweet Tea + Lemonade) to wash it down.  Followed by a nap.\n\nI really have no clue what else to say about this place. I LOVE IT.",4
"\""Meh\"" is a very good word to describe my experience with Postino East. The wait time we were given was 20 minutes - which turned into 50 minutes. We were given really awkward seating - a couch that was shared with a couple (it could have been detached, I'm not sure why they insisted on pushing everything together). \n\nThere were flies EVERYWHERE. Hang bags of water above doorways - flies won't go under anywhere they can sense water above them. Or let them crawl all over the food, as Postino seems to prefer.\n\nThe food was okay. It was very affordable though. The waitstaff is also very nice and polite, and despite the busyness of the morning, prompt.\n\nI'm not sure why they chose to have way more outdoor seating than indoor seating in a city that's unbearably hot for a good part of the year. Seems like a waste of space to me.\n\nOverall I'd like to visit for dinner or lunch. The food is affordable and well-made, but their handling of crowds can definitely be improved.",2
It's ok. Nothing special.,2
"Thank you Tanda M. for reminding me to review this.  I went to the casino two weeks ago.  It was cool, but not as exciting as most casinos I've been to.  Usually the atmosphere is enough to make me want to stay awhile...",1
"While I understand that this is a chain restaurant, I still think there are much better Mexican food places to go to than Arriba.\n\nThis was my first experience with Arriba Mexican Grill. I ordered the Chile Colorado. The menu designates this as a 2-chile (fiery) dish and to me it was mildly spicy (1-chile or snappy according to their ratings). I was supposed to get rice, beans and tortillas with this and when it was brought to my table, there were no frijoles negro nor tortillas. I pointed this out to my waitress. She apologized and said that she'd be back with them right away. About 5 min later, she walked by the table with no beans or tortillas in sight and asked her about them again. She forgot.  By the time I got my beans and tortillas, I was done with my dinner!!!\n\nAfter paying for my meal and going up to the front, I asked to speak to the manager about this horrible situation (I waited to complain to the manager because I didn't want my food tainted by something - seen it done too many times when I worked in a restaurant). I told the tale of experience to the manager and it fell upon deaf, or unsympathetic, ears.\n\nI WILL NEVER EAT, DRINK OR STEP INTO THIS PLACE AGAIN!!!",0
"Absolutely terrible. \n\nHaving been to the location in Milpitas CA and Jillians in Charlotte, NC. i had high hopes. Its nice to be able to act like an overgrown child without having to contend with kids running around everything. (Both of the other places didn't let underage kids in after 5pm.)\n\nYet I come here, and its like I was walking into a Chuck E Cheese with beer. Kids running around all over the place, playing on all the stuff I wanted to play. Finally get to play whatever, and some parent is standing over your shoulder because their kid wants in. I don't hate kids or anything, but damn. The food and drinks absolutely cannot make up for how much the place sucks. \n\nTheir game selection is also wanting, but I've said enough.",0
"If you like out of the ordinary food and creative creations, this is for you, a foodies wonderland! Presentation was great, atmosphere inviting and warm, wait staff well educated, and they had a great offering of creative and tasty drinks. As a non-meat eater, the menu was meat heavy but there were plenty of other options. The butter poached cod was melt in your mouth and not greasy; the mushroom plate was splendid, the fluke ceviche was out of this world. Definitely worth the trip. A little hard to find without a sign, so keep your eyes open!",4
"So after reading some other reviews it looks like this place is total hit and miss. My experience was a total miss! \n\nMy Financee and I went from Sunday brunch and was suprised at how dark it is inside. I guess when I think diner I think bright and clean. There was a waitress shuffling around that looked like she wanted to cut a bithc and one that was hussling for the whole crew. \n\nMy financee got eggs benedict and while the sauce was good everything else was awful and I could only eat 3 bites of my chorizo omelet it was so greasy. \n\nI am tempted to say I will come back and try something else but frankly, they had their on chance to impress me (and I would have loved to add a cool new neighborhood joint to my list of faves) but they failed. I am out.",1
they make smaller tables wait longer to be sat and the food is not that great you can get better food at mid level steakhouse,0
"This is a good buffet with a lot of selection. The quality isn't up to Wynn standards, but it's a buffet.... I guess I am just not too crazy about them hence I'm giving it 3 stars. The service is very good, and our waitress was fantastic. The all you can drink for $10 is a killer deal for brunch too!\n\nService - 4 stars\nDrinks - 5 stars\nFood - 1.5 stars",2
"Food is good.  Service depends on which one you go to.  I went to the Columbus store and as the cashier was handing me my change, our sandwiches were being slid across the counter!   We went to the address for this review.  Food..Good.  Service... Not.  \n\nWe walked in around 5:30.  The place was empty.  It was just my daughter and I.  A single woman was behind us.  There were three on the line, one at cashier and two making sandwiches.  They took our order and their time on making our food.  As we sat down the lady behind us sat with a bag of chips and a soda in her hand to wait for her food.  Another lady came in and ordered as well.  As we ate, the second lady was presented her sandwich.  The first went to the counter to ask about hers and they looked surprised that they had missed it.  They missed something alright.\n\nIf you can get it, you will enjoy your meal.  I recommend you go for the multi-grain bread.  You can get a french roll anywhere.",2
"Scratch is still very new, so I'm looking forward to a lot of changes for the better.  They've got a great location, and the owner seems to have the enthusiasm for success.\n\nOur first attempt at scratch was kind of a disaster.  We had quite a large group and were there within their first month open, so it was almost to be expected.  However we were assured they could handle our group so we gave it a shot.  The service was slow at best.  Our waitress didn't seem to know how to handle a large table and made it a point to tell us that many, many times.  She made us feel like a burden, but reminded us that she had 20 years experience (so I'm not sure what the problem was).  We were later visited by the owner, and I believe some friends who didn't even work there who he called in to help - bonus points.  Still, after being told we couldn't order anything beside basic drinks (because the bartender \""probably won't know how to make them), we waited forever for water, beer, and eventually food.  I can't vouch for anyone else because frankly I wasn't paying attention, but my veggie burger seemed like something from the Sysco truck.  Not impressed.\n\nTry #2: Brunch.  Service was still slow and confused, but much better.  The Eggs Royale were commendable - their salmon has a uniquely mild and delicious flavor, and the eggs were cooked perfectly.  I was looking forward to trying one of their pastries, but was disappointed with the selection.  The pastry case looked bored.  With only about 3 different choices, the pastries looked good but unimpressive for bakery standards.  They had a selection of macaroons, which although likely fresh, seemed a bit pricey at $3.75 each.  I ended up skipping the pastries.\n\nLastly, and most notably, the place lacks personality.  There's something about the newly renovated complex Scratch lives in that makes it a fun place to go, but the atmosphere ends at the gate.",1
"Solid lunch pick.  Very consistent.  I don't get here very often because of the calorie count, but I'd eat here once a week if I could.  If you are looking for fast but good Italian this is the spot.  The only problem is having to decide if I want pizza or pasta.  Can I just eat both?\n\nMy daughter also loves this place and sometimes makes me go to Uptown just so we can go here.  I avoid Uptown at all costs outside of working hours, but I have to make an exception for her.",3
"This is the worst Dunkin Donuts I have ever been to and needs to be shut down. Went this morning and some machines were broken (no big deal I guess) but I ordered bagels and cream for my staff and they put bagels into a box and smashed the lid down and ripped the box and handed the mangled thing over to me. I expected to get a tub a cream cheese like a normal Dunkin donuts, and after waiting ten minutes they gave me a small coffee cup with a spoonful of cream cheese flung in there stuck to the side... Disgusting! I asked for a refund which took a while even with a line of customers out the door, the cashier yawned and broke rolls of quarters into the drawer and wouldn't acknowledge anyone for quite a few minutes. They were all extremely rude. The customer next to me asked for extra cream in her coffee and the workers tuts and says how much... The customer states well can I just do it? To which the workers says 'no, I said how much?'  \n\nAfter my refund I looked around for hidden cameras because I couldn't believe this place was for real.",0
"Located in the back of Zam Zam Market.  Unassuming family-run restaurant catering to local Afghan and South Asian clientele. Gracious and solicitous service.  Don't let the drab decor put you off.  Food is fresh, authentic and delicious.  Mintoo is absolutely terrific.  A welcome dose of unpretentious international comfort food in Phoenix.",4
"Excellent customer service, excellent flight, just an unbeatable experience overall. Dean and Veronica were a pleasure to work with from beginning to end. I felt safe in their capable hands. Check one off the bucket list and go with Skyline - you won't regret it!",4
"I have been to this location on 3 separate occasions. Food is consistently delicious!! Parking is consistently crappy. You have to be one of the lucky 5 people to get a non-valet spot. If you don't, good luck finding street parking that isn't resident-only. Sometimes your only choice is valet. I guess I'm cheap, but it makes me angry that I have to tip a guy to walk 10 feet to get my car. Oh well.\n2 of the 3 times I have been the service was great. This last time, was not so great. I was in a large party (~10 people) and they sat us right away, which was awesome. The place was not very busy as we were there for a very early dinner on a Sunday (4pm). Our waiter took our drink orders at 4:15, they were delivered and then disappeared until 5 (which is, you guessed it, then end of Happy Hour). He came back at 5:01 on the dot. Kinda sucks. As we were all hungry and eager to order, but it was not until sometime later that he re-appeared for the food order. \\\n\nHe did the whole, \""I'm too awesome to write down any of your orders\"" bit. Even though we were each getting an order of Bruchetta (which gives the option to choose 4). Luckily, he got our orders correct, but if he hadn't? I am not going to tip you more because you didn't write it down!  Even if you get it right 95% of the time, it's really crappy for that 5% that you mess up! Anyway, our food came and it was delish! \n\nWhen our bill came, I realized why he didn't show his face more than the few times over the 3 hours that we were sitting there....they pre-added in his tip. 20%! He was made whether he gave us good service or not. \n\nI will be going back because, like I said, I usually have great service and ALWAYS have great food....but this one encounter did put a sour taste in my mouth.",3
"Over-priced small portions served in a long dark minimalist room (looks like they ran out of money before they even thought about decorating), located in a warren of small buildings on a deserted city lot.  Been there twice and maybe it was off hours but place was almost empty and service was barely serviceable. Original chef recently jumped ship. If you're smart, you won't even board. Abysmal.",1
"A couple of colleagues and I dropped in one night after work for a bite to eat.  We sat outside on the patio.  It was around 6:30 pm and the place was packed.  I ordered:\n\nGuacamole & Chips, $10\nGreen Chile Burger (Poblano Chili, Cheddar Cheese, Chipotle Aoli), $13\n\nThe Guacamole was very good.  Much better than I expected.  The Green Chile Burger was awesome.  The bitter taste of the Peppers went well with the juicy Burger and melted Cheese....also, the Chipotle Aoli gave it a smooth finish and nice kick.\n\nService here was very good.  Our server was attentive and kept our Wine glasses full.  Can't wait to come back and try more items.\n\nReturn Factor - 90%",3
"Not too much to say here. Went to the Fry Bread House for lunch and got a Green Chili Indian Taco. Inexpensive, came out of the kitchen in about seven minutes, huge, and absolutely delicious. Dining area is clean, staff is friendly, food is very tasty (if not the healthiest in the world...), and service is fast. The only con is the dining area is very small so you can feel packed in. \n\nOverall, the Fry Bread House is a great little local place to go to if you ever want some fast, delicious food at a low price!",3
"Not a huge fan. The food always seems cold. \n\nWe had a double cheeseburger meal with tots. it was ok. \n\nThe best thing about Sonic is... hmmm.... ?\n\nWe ate there since it was nice out. I don't like ordering from a wall it seems dumb since the people are 10 feet away, you think someone would come ask for your order. I paid with credit and she took all the food back in with her to run the card. Like I would steal it with my 2 kids with me. They don't do refills on pop....like not even as a favor. \n\nI wanted to like it but never seem to.",1
"I had no idea this gem was only two blocks from my church. The pizza is amazing. The cheese, the sauce and the bread are all delicious. It has a New York feel to it as well - all the pizzas are on display; you pick a slice and they heat it up for you. The service is great as well - super friendly staff. I'm sold on this place and honored to be a regular.",4
"Everything about Nora's was an amazing experience!\n\nWe walked in, were seated right away, and the staff was very attentive to our needs. \n\nChecked in on the Yelp app and received a glass of wine! Free wine = AMAZEBALLS!\n\nStarted off with the house garlic bread. It was very good. You could tell this was homemade, not some frozen loaf coming from a distributor. Just that principle of not having frozen cheap appetizer had me already falling in love. \n\nThen we moved to the bruschetta. It came served on a large slide of soft bread. This was some of the best bruschetta I've ever had. It was not your average sampling, this is what I've been missing my entire life. \n\nMy entree was the rigatoni gorgonzola with chicken. Similar to the bruschetta, this was done right! The pasta was perfectly textured and consistent throughout. The sauce on this was heavier than my liking, but it fit very well with the dish. The biggest surprise here was the blue cheese on top. I've never heard of pasta being topped with blue cheese, but I fell in love with it! \n\nBy this point we were stuffed and ready to fall asleep in our carb coma.",4
"First off, to THB's credit I will say that the place was very busy the night I went (3/14/2014) and the ambiance was amazing. I chose this restaurant solely on the great Yelp reviews, so maybe my particular experience was just an unlucky one. That said...I won't be coming back.\n\nThe evening started off kind of shaky. Service was very slow to greet, and we felt like we'd been handed off back and forth between waitstaff from the outset of the meal. Waitress was definitely spread thin, and we felt rushed to put in our full order from the get-go. Personally, I like to eat my appetizers before ordering main dishes, but it seemed like this was not an option. So after waiting about 15 mins after getting our drinks, we were finally able to order. The app was great, we had the Baked St. Andre Cheese. AMAZING but we ran out of bread quickly. We ordered more...but it never came...waited for it but the cheese was getting cold, so we just ate the cheese and cancelled our order. Strike ONE.\n\nWe soon received our main dishes, the filet and the scallop entrees respectively. Scallops were great, 10/10. The steak, which we ordered medium rare, was uncooked...not undercooked, but practically BLUE in the middle. We sent it back immediately and got some cheese puffs, the night's amuse bouche, to hold us over. When we got the steak back after a good amount of time, it still wasn't cooked properly, but we were tired of waiting at this point and just decided to deal with it. STRIKE TWO.\n\nFinally, dessert comes and it is a birthday dessert, which was a deconstructed goat cheese cake. I know this is an experimental restaurant, but this was a failed experiment for sure. However, since it was a free dish, and of course everyone's taste is different, I wasn't too upset. \n\nWhat did bother me, though, was when a waitress grabbed our UNFINISHED bottle of wine off the table before we could get a word in, and immediately threw it in the trash. We were definitely planning on finishing it or at least taking the corked bottle home. STRIKE THREE.\n\nThere was one more thing that bothered me. When I got the check, I saw that we were charged for the cheese puffs sent out by the kitchen when we sent back our undercooked steak. I brought this to the waitress' attention and she quickly removed it, but not before making a remark about how \""the first ones are free but additional ones are extra.\"" When I explained that we didn't order them, she rudely interrupted me to remind me that they were indeed removed from the check so it was a non-issue.\n\nPerhaps a one-off bad experience, but in this case; when it rains, it pours.",1

The food is aweful!!!!!!!!!!! Seriously...it's terrible! \n\nGO here for fun drinks or dessert. Don't waste your time or money on the food. I can't even say the food average which is pretty sad when you have a group of 6 and the average drink per person is 1 and the bill is over $300. Such a disappointment!!!!,0
Great place. We went on a Fri night and sat outside it sits in a very cool building. The menu wasp bigger than I thought with a little something for everyone. I actually changed my order from the salmon burger that I original asked for.  The service was good although we could have used some extra plates with our apps but no big deal. I had the spinach and bacon quiche with a salad and side of sweet potatoes fries. Delicious. My wife had the kitchen sink salad with wasabi dressing per the server recomendation. He was right. The vegetables were fresh and crisp which is exactly what we were looking for. The lemon cheesecake was worth the visit in itself. All the food was very good and light. We left full but not heavy feeling. Gotta big cup of coffee to go and enjoyed with a nice cigar downstairs by the fountain. Definitely will be back.,3
When I informed Bree I wanted a call back from a manager she said that I could call the manager back when she came in. How many customer service people have told you they won't take a message and that YOU can call THEM back???When I came in to talk to the manager she had no idea what I was complaining about.,0
Ive only ever been here for Brunch or Lunch but I really like it!!\n\nIf your planning on coming in for Brunch make sure you get there a little early because the wait can be long!! But since we live in NC and by law NO alcohol is to be served till 12 on Sundays expect no Mimosa or Bloody Mary :(  but if you decide to wait a little later you will be able to have it all!! \n\nThe Butterscotch Scones are really good!! They bring them over at the beginning of your meal and you will definitely want another!! If you come for lunch try the melted Brie it is served with fruit and crackers it is really good!! The service is good and attentive. Only bad thing about this place is the walk up and down the large staircase but I think it's worth the walk!,3
"Graze has trendy local food. Vegan options are slim, but they're usually willing to substitute or cook something differently. No kombucha at the bar, unfortunately, but a nice list of non-alcoholic drinks. Great view. The pickle plate is amazing!!",2
"more like sugar deaddy's.\n\nthis place slid and slid fast. when i moved here 5 years ago, it was a great place to grab some beers outside on the patio. on a thursday thru saturday night, you'd actually have a hard time finding a parking spot.\n\nnow, it's like driving by a cemetery. after the tax deal, then all the fights that happen there, you couldn't pay me to go to that place. ghost town would be how i'd describe it. so, i will. it's a ghost town.\n\ntotal waste of a great place. put a fork in it.",0
"They microwaved their bread so long that it was hard like a rock when it cooled downed.  I sent back two appetizers because they were microwaved and just disgusting.  Don't order anything is pastry puff.  The lamb was soooo tough it was not edible.  Waitress argued this is how they aways made it, and she ate it every day.  Too bad for her!  Don't waste your money on this overpriced, poor quality food.  And when they say it includes pine nuts in the dish, don't believe it unless you have a microscope and are willing to search for it!!!  So so bad, ugh, $60 for 3 apps and 1 entree... what a waste!!!!",0
We went there with a Groupon and were pleasantly surprised at how good the food and drinks were. Definitely will return. Ordered the shriracho burger and lavender lemon fizz. So delicious.,4
"I don't know why they decided to put Vegas' first Golden Corral on the east side, more importantly right next to Home Depot. I guess the thought of buffet food and home improvement go well together?\n\nAnyways, this place is always crowded with family and children. I mean most buffets are pretty loud, but if you're looking to stay away from a mass amount of children then try not to go here.\n\nThe food is alright. It's your basic buffet food - nothing really sticks out. They have your salads, soup, Chinese, American, etc. I did not enjoy the pasta here. It was too bland for my liking. The only good thing I had was the steak. I asked for medium well and it came back medium well with a lot of juice to it. They have a dessert section mainly targeted at candy like M&Ms and gummy worms. They do have a chocolate fondue fountain, but I stayed clear from that because the area was a bit too messy for my liking.\n\nThe part that grossed me out the most though is the workers cleaning out the food section with the same towel. You see them cleaning the section where the sauce from the pasta spilled and next thing he's over there cleaning the Asian section with the SAME towel - smearing food across. It just doesn't seem sanitary to me.\n\nYou can try this place out just to get it off your bucket list, but don't expect much.",2
Best almond croissant ever! Everything looks so good. Can't wait to return to Montreal to have another.  At least as good as any bakery I've visited in Paris..wish there was one in Ottawa,4
The recliners are very nice to have. Concessions are ok. Alcohol for sale if that's your thing. The bathrooms are tiny. They clearly put all the money in the theater itself for the recliners w/tables. This place is located in the hood. I went there once and most of the people were ghetto. Not worth the higher pricing in my opinion. GVR is better.,2
"Excellent food, great service, just come when you have time to wait.  Well worth the wait though!",3
We  had our 16 year old Golden groomed in their mobile unit. Kelli was so gentle with him. She spent three hours making him look so handsome. Our dog is blind and very old but she did a great job making him comfortable. He has ne\nver looked better!,4
"Interesting previous review.  My experience was pretty good, trying to decide on style and color.  The manager David had the warehouse move furniture from one location to another for comparison.  Great service in that respect.  Still trying to determine what I want, but they were a huge help in eliminating what I didn't like.",2
"The place doesn't look like much, but their food is great. They just painted it bright orange and green, so it actually stands out now like it should rather than just being an overlooked secret.",3
"I had lunch here with a coworker. I ordered the Humdinger, really just because I wanted to say it. It was underwhelmingly average...Nothing really stood out for me. It was busy, the service was average and the thick bread sandwich was similar to Schlotzsky's.  I could go again or I could skip it. It was just okay for me, dog.",1
"This is definitely the only place for great AYCE sukiyaki/shabu shabu in Las Vegas. I used to come here a lot but I soon declined as I realized there were many places in Vegas I was able to get more bang with my buck. Then I found out there was a change in management and they had added the option of AYCE. THIS CHANGED EVERYTHING. No longer did I have to worry about not being \""full\"" after paying twenty dollars for my meal. \n\nThe Good: Meat and vegetables are still to die for. And with the meat being all you can eat...or vegetables if you get the veggie platter, there is nothing to complain about with in the food department. I always like to ask for a raw egg and dip the meat after it's done cooking. Yum! Oh. And never forget to ask for the garlic. Even though I might have to change my clothes later because of the garlic smell, it really adds a great taste. All of the AYCE prices are reasonable priced. They also have good deals on alcohol, like AYCE sake for $9.99. Can't beat that.\n\nThe Bad: The only thing bad at times is the service occasionally. When it's the older gentlemen working, he is very keen on all our needs. He is the best! While, if it's the younger staff, we could be sitting there by ourselves and we will have to wave them down for another serving. \n\nBut overall, a great price for AYCE shabu shabu/sukiyaki! Yum.",3
"My first time using Spirit was just fine - even with all the extra charges for seats, drinks, luggage etc - it still worked out and I saved a bit of money. This last trip from Oakland to Vegas was no problem - all went well - problem was on the flight home. I arrived on time for the flight waiting at the gate - and 45 before the flight we are told to move to another gate - no worries - hoofed it over to next gate - arrive at new departure gate and we are told our plane is being taken over by  flight to Chicago - WTF why?. Our flight was delayed over an hour - what made matters worse is that attendant at he desk near the gate never really told a lot of the folks expecting to go to Oakland on time that their was delay and the announcements over the loud speakers kept telling us we were still on time for Oakland - guess what a lot of people for Oakland start trying to board the Chicago flight - not good. Finally get on the right flight - arrived to my seat which I paid more for and found that someone had broken an ink pen and smeared ink all over the seat - did not look like the seat had been cleaned - I was not offered another seat - I had to scrounge around and find something to place over the seat so I could sit down and not ruin my pants - never again Spirit - dirty planes, delays all the time from what I heard from other passengers.",0
"My husband, daughter and I stopped here for lunch. We chose this place as they touted having the \""best burger in Charlotte\"".  There was only one other table with anyone at it, and there were 3 tables filled on the patio. The aesthetics were nice, but the service and food left much to be desired. The waitress walked by us several times without acknowledging us and when she did, we were smart enough to just order. That didn't change the fact that we waited way too long for our food. Once we got our food, it was just ok. The bacon was wilted, there was no seasoning on the burgers, and the Mac and cheese tasted microwaved. To top it all off, for 2 burgers and a kids meal, it was $50.  We are willing to pay for good food and we tip well. This place just did not deserve it. I completely understand why the waitress never asked how everything was.  As we are driving home, my husband is complaining of a stomach ache, and he NEVER gets sick. \n\nWe will NOT be back, and hopefully the leftovers we brought won't kill our dogs.",0
What a fun and hip spot outside the sportsbook at Aria.  We just had two slices-cheese with a white sauce and basil and meat.  Both were yummy.  I love the space and location and will be back!,3
"HORRIBLE SERVICE. I went with my boyfriend and his family for his sister's birthday. Automatically when we walked in, the lady at the front gave us attitude when asking how many? What happened to smiling and greeting your customers? I automatically thought this was going to be a horrible lunch. \n\nWhen we saw the menu, I noticed almost everything was overpriced for the amount that they only give you. Don't be fooled of how the pictures look! Expect little.\n\nWe asked the lady 5 times for SIX forks. After the second time we asked, she finally gave us THREE. Then we had to ask her another few times to finally give us the last three. Ridiculous. When we ordered our soups, there was no bowls, no serving spoon. What do you expect us to do? Share from the same bowl?\n\nWe then later asked our server to take a picture of us. She grunted and said \""I'm so busy\"" [there was barely anyone there] but she ended up taking the pictures anyways ---- Then she dropped my boyfriend's phone and didn't even bother picking it up. \n\nDON'T GO HERE. We wish we saw the yelp reviews before we checked this place out. ABSOLUTELY RIDICULOUS.",0
"overpriced, overrated and bad service\n\nMy family and I (5 with three kids) decided to try Serendipity 3 after reading some great reviews on it in our hotel places to eat booklet.  They had it rated with Bouchons in the Venetian which is an absolutely great place to dine.  Serendipity was horrible..overpriced very basic root beer floats and shakes that cost half the total bill.  I've had much better in Johnny Rockets or McDonalds(seriously) for shakes. Service was bad.  It took about 30 min for those basic root beer floats and shakes.  Then the food was bland with no taste..I had chicken pot pie, my wife had the don't be afraid of my alfredo....be afraid of the Alfredo.  Olive Garden is better.  All the entrees were bad except for my sons wings...they were ok...not good but ok.  Don't fool yourself..this is not a good place to eat.  Vegas has so many other better choices.",0
"It's ok....the concept is good and maybe we should've walked a little further down the boulevard to find other restaurants...but we were hungry!!! There was a line outside and we were seated in the patio - which was in the casino floor under the fake outdoor lighting. \n\nWe were seated at 1055 and received the breakfast menu, but thankfully lunch was served at 11, so we had both! I ordered the french onion soup which was decent but a bit greasy. I also had half a Parisien sandwich and ceasar salad. I wished the sandwich was warm like a cocque monseiur, but instead it was cold. The ceasar salad was the best part of my meal. \n\nService was ok. Our server never checked on us after taking our order.",2
We have visited this place for dinner.we have ordered the spring rolls and chicken fried rice.spring rolls were perfect and good.the chicken fried rice was good but the best I have eaten from Thai restaurents they can make it better with Thai flavours.overall it's a good visit,2
"Location, location, location. Mill Avenue's Harkins Centerpoint has one of the best locations in Arizona. The theatre is located on Mill Avenue, a popular college street, which is a hop, skip and a jump away from campus. And I'm a fan because it's pretty close to where I live. \n\nIf you're looking for luxury, try the new Harkins at Tempe Marketplace. But if you enjoy quiet, peaceful theatres, you'll like it here even with the old seats and lack of grub. Even though it's close to campus, the theatre is rarely crowded, which makes it nice when you're running late and don't want to battle the crowds. It's also a nice theatre to go catch a flick by yourself.",2
"Pilier de mon alimentation lorsque j'\u00e9tait \u00e0 l'universit\u00e9, Reuben's deli a drastiquement chang\u00e9. Dans les points positif, le d\u00e9cor qui avait grand besoin d'un rafraichissement \u00e0 compl\u00e8tement \u00e9t\u00e9 refait.

"Changing Hands is the perfect bookstore. These types of places just don't seem to exist, but Changing Hands has managed to survive.\n\nAllow me to begin by saying that this bookstore does not have anywhere near the selection of a Barnes and Noble (or probably a Borders, but I don't go into that garbage store and cannot be sure). With that said, there are a few reasons to shop here.\n\nFirst, and most importantly, they have well priced used books. I believe most of their used books are $7.50. They are also all in pristine condition. Now, $7.50 used isn't always that great for a paperback. You can do better online quite often. What's notable, however, is that their hardcovers are typically $7.50 as well. This is a fantastic price and is hard to beat.\n\nSecond, the location of CH is perfect. This is one of the best plazas out there. Wildflower, Trader Joe's, Mac's, Jamba Juice--you can't go wrong.\n\nThird, and finally, Changing Hands is a local store, and many good things come with that. The staff is extremely friendly. From what I can tell, they are all hardcore book nerds and you have to love that. The store also has a very welcoming feel to it. Once you're in, you will realize how extremely friendly everyone is. No, not just the staff--the customers. Everyone is talkative, friendly, and just seems to be happy. They are all indulging in one of their hobbies in one of the most inviting stores I have ever seen. Someone will ask the staff \""who wrote such and such?\"". The staff will almost assuredly spot a regular and ask him or her  \""who wrote such and such\"". If he doesn't know, someone else will  probably pipe up. It's this type of thing that makes it a great store. Overall, it just has a great atmosphere.\n\nThe only negative comment I can make about Changing Hands is how hippy it is. There's a ton of books on spiritual techniques, new age methods, buddhism, and whatever the hell else hippies/hipsters think makes them look more cultured. Of course, this just goes along with the Tempe, Trader Joe's, and book reading demographic, so I can't blame them for meeting the inherent demand.",4
The staff was friendly!!! I do want to go back and take some classes here!,2
"The breakfast buffet at one time was arguably the best in Las Vegas, but it has continued to deteriorate under Harrah's ownership.  My menu included OJ, Lyonnaise potatoes (terrible), strawberries with yogurt, a variety of cheeses, a hard boiled egg Benedict (yuck) and Andouille sausage",1
"5 stars as far as hotels go. Nothing fancy about it compared to the other Vegas hotels. It was clean, cozy, and comfortable. I slept on the roll out bed that was super comfortable. AND the comforters in the rooms are the BEST in the whole wide world! Bathroom was spacious, which I appreciate b/c nothing drives me crazier then having my knees hit the tub when I am releasing my 24 gin and tonics from the evening. I did wish they had mirrors within the room and not just restricted to the bathroom. Makes it difficult to get ready when you are sharing the space with friends. I also appreciate the double curtains on the windows that shields us from daylight in the morning. Especially on the mornings after an eventful night at Badda Bing. http://www.yelp.com/biz/badda-bing-las-vegas#hrid:vQ06lAyg8UIM3ZN0EDy_GQ",3
"Charming 3-star newcomer. Stumbled upon Centurion while downtown for Third Friday, piqued by the curious Roman centurion statue beckoning from the outer courtyard.\n\nPros:\nApproachable, balanced wine list; chef was friendly to suggest pairings and provided another guest with a personalized tasting experience. Owner mentioned beer license pending, plans to offer largely microbrew, craft beer selections.\n\nInteresting, ambitious menu with several different moules preparations, a tempting risotto selection, and brick oven-fired pizzas.\n\nOwners have put in a lot of thought into the European feel - Old World decor, mostly tables for two, couch seating against two walls of the restaurant, gated front patio seating.  \n\nOf note - they offer extensive happy hour and reverse happy hour/late night specials.\n\nNegs:\nService was inexplicably slow despite the restaurant having only a few parties. \n\nWhen asked about the unusually high amount of cracked mussels in a dish (~1/3), the server she responded that the chef probably just stirred too hard, which he corrected and pegged the poor quality to their supplier. At any rate, would recommend staying away from moules to avoid a mouthful of shell pieces. The Portugese preparation did not include any chorizo, contrary to the description.\n\nThe formal dinner settings were a bit overwhelming for the tiny cafe, which would have made movement impossible if the restaurant was full. \n\n\nWhile Centurion still has some work to do on sorting out its kinks, would return as it is overall a unique neighborhood find.",2
"I liked it at first, but recently the service has been HORRIBLE!! \nWe waited in our booth for over 10 minutes and still didn't receive any water or menus at least. The staff were so busy vacuuming and cleaning around us. (this was on a friday night with hardly anybody there)\n\nWhen we finally got up to leave, a waitress comes by and asks if we have been helped??? (ugh 2 people sitting down at a table with no water, no menus, no drinks, no food???? what do you think??)\nI told her we had been waiting at least 10 minutes and her only response was that no one told her!!!!\n\nThe food is good, but not worth it since you will be waiting a LONG time to get served. This was already the 3rd time since we had to wait to get a menu or anything. I recommend you go to MELLOW MUSHROOM across the street instead.",0
"This place is very cute...like ridiculously cute. I always thought it was going to be very small from passing by, but it actually is quite large and comfortable. They serve Lux coffee (woohoo!). The reason for only 3 stars is that the food just wasn't anything terribly special. Now, I may have ordered the wrong thing...I got the savory crepe, and it was fresh, but just not that flavorful and lacked any texture. The BF got the waffle with bacon, and he also thought it was just ok. I don't think I would go out of my way to come here again, but if I were in the neighborhood, I would definitely come back.",2
"My buddy and I went here for a quick lunch because we had a buy one get one coupon. Actually we had two of them. One came from the Entertainment Book and another I found on the website. We walk in and its lunch hour. It's busy. It's noisy. It's chaotic. The guy at the counter is getting stressed so someone I assumed to be a manager relieved him and started taking orders. \n\nIt comes to our turn and we order according to our buy one Teriyaki bowl get one free coupon. We were told that we couldn't use the coupon there. So I said well do you take other coupons. The guy at the register tells me, \""If they are for our store then maybe.\"" Well, I'm not trying to pass off a grocery coupon here guy.... so we try another Samurai Sam's coupon. He looks at it for a minute and points out the small print. \n\n\""See? At participating locations only.\"" \n\""So I take it you are not a participating location?\""\nHe just shakes his head no. \n\nNow, I dunno... I'm no big business person. But This just got us off on the wrong foot. This and a few other reasons is why I won't go back to Samurai Sam's. I live about a mile from the place too. It is highly likely that if the food was good and there were no hassles with the coupons when ordering. I would have come back many times - without a coupon even! So wouldn't it be worth the say... $5 Teriyaki bowl to retain someone that is going to return and spend far beyond the cost of the bowl you gave away with the coupon I was trying to use? \n\nIt just doesn't make sense to me but oh well. \n\nWe were already there so we order anyway. Now keep in mind I'm irked about the coupon situation so my outlook on the Samurai Sam experience could be a bit tainted. \n\nWe get our food and my rice was really dry. It didn't seem done. The veggies were ok. Just blech. Not much flavor. The chicken was decent and fortunately the whole thing was coved in Teriyaki sauce which made it edible. \n\nMy friend said his thing was ok but neither of us were really thrilled from the minute we walked in.",1
"The food was good, but our waiter got our order wrong twice. My friends and I had to wait three times to make sure we got our correct order. \nAtmosphere is lively and great.\nCleanliness is what you would expect for the big chain restaurant.\nService was sub par.\nFood was above average.\nValue for the money, was middle of the pack.",2
"I really enjoyed my visit at Best Foot Spa. We made a reservation but showed up half an hour early and they immediately seated us with no hesitation. We were offered tasty hot tea as the massage began. Large tubs of water were brought out. It's basically a wooden tub lined with a plastic bag filled with warm water. You put your feet in and they wrap the bag up around them and put a towel over to keep everything nice and warm while you are relaxing. The recliners were tilted back for us and more pillows were brought to ensure we were comfortable which was very nice. I chose the 90 minute massage with 30 minutes on the feet which was $50. In my opinion it was definitely worth it. It was hard for me to relax at first because it was a new experience but soon I was able to let go and enjoy it. The massage started with my face and sinus area, followed by my scalp. I loved the scalp part. The one unusual thing was that the lady massaging me answered the shop phone while she was working. And then she got up and a man took her place for the rest of the massage. That was okay but a little strange. Anyway, he massaged my neck and shoulders for a long time, followed by my arms. Then he switched and did the foot portion during which he also worked on my calves. Then he had me flip over so he could work on my back and boy did he ever! It was painful at times but felt really good after. He really got in there and worked the knots out. My back felt fantastic afterwords. \n\nThe place was clean and the staff was very pleasant. I would definitely go back again.",3
"This yelp is based on the service, I received at store in the plaza.\n\nI cannot believe that they would have such inhospitable people working behind the counter. Can I say rude, rude ,rude, rude & rude. I came down to the strip for the Pacquiao fight not to be insulted by some pmsing, disrespecting, ass talking counter girl who thinks she's the queen of the nile!\n\nThis simple trip turned most unpleasant as the girl over the counter, made the most matter of fact remarks regarding the cigarette of my choice (davidoff lights) and when I dropped the pack (and 1000s of them prior) she makes her final distasteful remark, thus resulting in this yelp.\n\nWhat a complete turnoff!",0
"The garlic fries are to die for! Terrific menu, friendly service and innovative drinks. Yum! I'll be back.",4
This place sucks!!!! It took 45 min to get a ford ranger cleaned! And there was only 6 cars in the entire place! Staff were all joking around and goofing off instead of cleaning the 6 cars on the line! Vacuum job sucked and the interior window was just a smear of dirt! I will never come back here!,0
"On a road trip, my boyfriend and I ended up a day early in Las Vegas and didn't have a place to stay. In Naming Our Own Price and Saving (priceline, duh), we were able to secure a room at the Luxor for $39 -- especially nice since Leo doesn't believe in paying for rooms in LV. \n\nWe arrived and got a room in the pyramid, which is a nice novelty to say we've done. But the room is definitely outdated. I'm sure it would have been totally super cool in 1993, when the pyramid was built and was the tallest building on the strip (according to my Foursquare message from the History Channel). Now, however, the hieroglyphics on the closet don't make up for what the room lacks. Typical LV hotel essentials -- a safe and a luggage -- were missing. \n\nBut the room did come with something extra-special. The PLU sticker from a mango was found on the bathroom floor. We felt so special to receive such thorough cleaning. \n\nA definite plus was the fitness room, which had enough quality cardio equipment to go around. I can't speak to the quality of the weights, but I appreciate the amount of space provided.",1
"OMG KoMex! Korean-Mexican fusion? Genius! KoMex is quite a ways from my house but their food's so good I don't mind driving half way across town for it. The restaurant is a little small and the decor is just regular, but that's not important. The food is what's important. They offer chips with salsa and FRESH guacamole to snack on while you wait for your order. I'm a big fan of carne asada fries so when I tried their bulgogi fries it was just heaven on earth. It is the perfect combination of sweet and spicy. The bulgogi burrito is also very good but I rather prefer their fries. Every one needs to try this place, it's inexpensive and it's just really that good!",4
"Probably the best Half Moon location in town! \n\nEveryone's gotta love a good sports bar. This one is centrally located, close to my gym and set up nicely. They recently, well within the last year, renovated their patio, it needed it! They have a fun fireplace in the order, high top tables, a pool table and new flat screen tv's out there now. Inside, the bar is big, tons of TVs and a private room that you can reserve for you and your friends for less distraction while watching the game or fight. **They don't charge for Pay-Per-View fights!!! :-) \n\nAs I said in my review of other Half Moon's their food is really good for bar food and they have some of the best fries I have found in this state. I also recommend the Long Island Iced Tea, be careful though, more than two and you will be on your ass.",3
"This is how it all starts.\n\nCall GRUBHUB or actually place my order online.  All of a sudden I get the call, 'Kimberley?\"" in a very thick asian accent.  \""Yes?\""  (I wondering what's wrong....)\n\""We have your order and we will be 20 min\""..... okay I'm thinking,,,,, HUH?  what do you mean 20 minutes?  20 minutes till they get the order cooked and done or 20 minutes until you are on my front door?\n\nThey had all the hotel info, but then informed me that they were not allowed up to the room.  I'm worried.... Does this mean that he is downstairs right freeking now???!  So I proceed to ask him a series of questions...... \""ARE you downstairs right now???\"" , he says \""No, 20 mins\"".  Im still puzzled.  He then says, \""I'm not allowed to come up to your room, only lobby\"".  I'm thinking....are you in the lobby RIGHT NOW????  He says, \""No, See you in 20 mins\"".  and I'm thinking ...okay, we have figured out the plan now.  Then he says \""I've been waiting 20 mins\"".  OMG!!!!!!!! Now what?!?!?!!!!  Does this mean he has been WAITING downstairs for 20 mins now????!  What the hell!  Finally we come to an agreement that he is in fact, NOT downstairs and I tell him to call me when he is in the lobby.  He then says again, \""See you in lobby\"", with a thick accent and very little english.  I'm going bat shit now....  I hang up thinking, am I going to see food tonight or not??   He calls in 15 more minutes, \""Kimberley...I in lobby\"".  then he mumbles something about coming up to my room.  I'm thinking ARE YOU COMING TO THE DOOR???  He then states that security won't let him upstairs.  Well.... I can get security to bring you upstairs.... He then says, No, security says no..... I'm pulling my hair out by now.....\n\nAll I had ready was a bathrobe and slippers.... so I went down to the lobby in front of everyone who was checking in..... to get my food.\n\nHe's sitting there and jumps up right away.... GOOD GUESS...since we have never met before.\n\nSeriously, for the $, this food is totally legit.  Very authentic and very very tasty.\n\nI had the Papaya Salad, which was probably the best I've tasted in years & Red Curry with beef, it was so addictive I wanted to eat the entire tub full but that's way way too much, the chicken satay, it wasn't dry, tasteless at all with the same greasy peanut sauce that everybody uses...it was in fact a cut above.  Everything was fresh, the lettuce, the onions, the tomatoes.... everything was recently prepared just for my order and for that they get a GREAT BIG gold star!",4
"I was charged twice, good thing I check my statements!  Our driver, Joe, completely ruined the surprise for my husband on our honeymoon despite the many times I told the booking gal Holly how important it was that it was a surprise. Joe's language was anything but professional, he didn't even OPEN THE DOOR for us, nor did he know how to operate the DVD player so we had bright, blank screens blasting at us the whole trip. The owner Raffic had promised that it would be a surprise and that he would have it all taken care of. There was also electrical tape holding the audio deck together. Truly a disappointment. Only upside was that the hummer limo was relatively clean on the outside, that's about as good as it gets.  Get your smile on and go elsewhere, best of luck!",0
"Before heading back to reality and heading home, my friends and bf wanted a nice good breakfast to end our fun weekend in the Sin City and with the helped of yelp it brought us to this place. Upon driving up to this place you can already see groups of people waiting outside so you must know that this restaurant is good. \n\nI had their Kalua Pig Benedict which I enjoyed a lot. I would recommend this dish to anyone who likes egg benedict. \n\nMy boyfriend had their Portuguese Sausage and Eggs and it was okay, don't think he'll get it again as the sausages were just sausages, nothing really stood out with this dish. The garlic rice that he order had too much garlic in it as well. Will not recommend this dish to anyone. \n\nTried a few pieces of their Red Velvet Pancakes and it was good, little too sweet for me, but no complaints here. \n\nAlso tried their Buttermilk Pancakes and again it tastes like pancakes to me. Honestly I can see why people would stand for over an hour to eat here, this please is pretty good, but next time I'm in town I would just pick up the phone and order, lesson learned. =]",3
"Came here last Sunday for brunch and I thought it was so cute. There was a little bit of a wait because they closed their outdoor seating area due to weather. Was told that the bloody mary's were really good so I ordered that along with the basic breakfast with over-medium eggs, biscuit, country ham, and sweet potato hash. Everything was delish except for the sweet potatoes they were a bit soggy. I hadn't had a decent biscuit and country ham in a while (I live in Los Angeles but grew up in Northern VA) and it was great. Very cute and fun environment. I recommend for brunch!",3
"Went in for some apps and drinks.  We had the OX tail and coconut soup.   The Ox tail was good, the bread shell the ox tail was in was so soft.  The coconut soup was just ok, I found it very thin and lacking any real favor.  The appeal of the soup was that it came in a coconut, other then that skip the coconut soup.  The ox tail is worth a try.",2
"Fairly good cheese pizza here, especially the slices at lunch time.  Nice thin crust that is reminiscent of thin crust examples I've had in Chicago.  Fries are very good as well, and the portion size is very generous.  Negatives, though, are that there's hardly any parking and the place doesn't exactly feel very inspiring with the cleanliness.  Why do they have those privacy drapes for the kitchen doorway anyway - what are they hiding?",2
"Do Not Go Here.  The only reason I have more than one experience is that they put tires on my car and I got the warranty and had to use it a few times.  So got lazy and let them do some of the other things that needed doing.  The tires are fine but:\n\nThey put crappy brake pads on my car - they work but squeal like crazy.  I kept taking it back there and they \""could not replicate the problem\"".  I took it to AAA on S. Blvd and they said the quality of pads on the pad were not good and replacment was the only option to stop the loud squeal that announces my every stop.  \n\nWhen in for the tires I attempted to get inspected- the manager of the place told me that my shocks were bad and that the car would not pass inspection.   This is crap, I have driven enough barely-passing-inspection cars to know the deal.  He wanted to charge me over 500.00 for new ones.  I did have a bulb out (they wanted 30.00 to change this) so they got to fail my car.  Good for them.\n\nService in general sucked too.\n\nGo to AAA on South Blvd- these guys have nothing to sell you so they treat you right.  SO glad I found them.",0
Slooowwwwww service with a bunch of kids running the store. Not that kids can't do business too. I just don't think they have a good enough syStem down for the volume they get here. Time to add another trop on blue diamond/the surrounding areas OR get more people working on site!!! 20 min proceSs no less. :-/,1
"Jimmy John's catered our working lunch today & they delivered super-fast \n\n1 Veggie Sub option.....guess what I chose \n\nMostly lettuce & overall, pretty darn bland - tasted no avocado although I saw a slight greenish schmeer. Tomatoes were very thin & didn't add a lot of flavor. It was supposed to have \""layers\"" of Provolone - I think I saw 1. The fact there were lots of sprouts was very nice! \n\nBread was nice & soft - but also mysteriously bland. The sandwich was filling so at least we had that.  Chips are nice & crunchy.  \n\nOthers got the Vito Sub (Italian), Turkey Tom, & whatnot - their go-to picks - they love 'em \n\nThis is a usual sandwich stop for my Charlotte crew..... I might have to give it a pass & instead opt for alternative veggie choices, but would be willing to try then again to give it a fair shot\n\n.....maybe next time I'd see if any hot peppers made a difference \n\nAt this point, I have to say, sorry guys but I've experienced better",1
"Eh. Not the best pizza of this type I have ever had ( Try Pizza Bruta, but that's a review for a different day). Atmosphere was nice, prices were decent, but the food really wasn't as good as it was cracked up to be. Worth a shot though.",2
Really cool to visit such an iconic spot! Just wish there were more places to park.,3
"Well, now I get why my family is always stopping here for a treat.  The custard rocks and is amazing.  I was especially impressed that I saw that Rita's supports local PTA's in the area.  Keep up the community involvement, and keep up the great product!\n\nService was friendly too when I went in.  It is always great to see counter help that does not look like they would rather be somewhere else. Work should be fun right?",4
"Very bad customer service!!!!! Just went to deposit a check and I didn't have a pen to sign the back of my check. So I hit the call button on the drive thru to ask for a pen, and the lady asked me \""WHAT DO I NEED\""??? WOW!! Everytime I go to this paticular branch I am treated very rudely.",0
"Always impressed!  The olive plate is a great starter.  Or the feta cheese plate.  My favorite entre is the Tyropita, which is vegetarian.  The vegetables served on the side are flavored with a little lemon, which is so nice.  Mmm!  I also really enjoy their cocktails and beer selection.  The lemon martinis are great!  My mom likes to celebrate her birthday here, and we've been to the Tempe location as well.  The flaming baklava was burned the last time we ordered it, but, other than that, very good experiences here.",2
"As you can see I do not review very often (or at all). I felt this place should be reviewed though. I work long  hours and many days of the week and I happened to have some time off to spend with my wife and my 2yr old son. I thought it would be nice to go \""try out the Italian place in Town Square.\"" They have outdoor seating and I love Italian food. I have ate at many of the other restaurants there in Town Square but not Brio.\n\nWhen we get there we asked to be seated outside since that was one of the reasons for choosing the place. We sit and wait a few minutes but not too long for the waiter to come by and take our drink orders. He leaves and is gone for a while but then comes back with waters which we didn't order but that is ok. Still waiting on my beer though. He eventually makes his way back to our table with my beer and takes our orders. \n\nAfter he leaves I take a nice big drink from my beer to realize the glass is dirty!! Now I'm a aircraft mechanic, I don't mind being dirty and have a certain tolerance for dirty, but when you charge 8 bucks for a beer I would like it in a clean glass or at least one that isn't sticky!!\n\nNow I wait a while for the waiter to come back to let him know the glass is dirty so he can replace it. Once again he finally shows up so i could inform him of the issue. He apologizes and says he will be right back. He does come right back with a new glass and proceeds to pour the beer from the dirty glass to the \""clean\"" one. No bullshit. Isn't that like scooping water from the toilet bowl and calling it clean? Needless to say I drank the water. \n\nI ordered one of the 14oz steaks since I was happy to spend time with the family. I ordered it medium because thats the way I like it. However, I got it well done, so well done the edges were burnt to s crisp! You got to be kidding me. A 30 dollar steak that you cooked all the flavor out of! I eat it because I am not the kind of person that will fuss about an overcooked steak only to get a properly cooked steak with spit in it. Especially after the dirty beer incident. \n\nI don't normally turn back food or complain since I am easily pleased but I think for a 100 dollar meal you should be pretty damn happy with all aspects of the service. \n\nI will never go here again! There are plenty of places to eat at Town Square and new ones are opening all the time. I'm hoping soon there will be a new opening in the Brio location. \n\nDo yourself a favor......eat somewhere else.",0
"Went to DeMarco's last Friday and will be back again!! Amazing food, cool atmosphere, and outstanding service. Didn't expect much but Tanya stood out as a server. She made outstanding reccomendations and made us feel important. Definitely a great place to grab a bite any time of day!",4
"We have been stopping at this restaurant for many years on our way north out of the valley and have enjoyed the food and service but, in the last couple of years we have been very disappointing in the service and the food.\n\nThe past three times we have been in the waitresses didn't smile, they were curt, the food was just mediocre and we had to ask to get refills on drinks. \n\nLast week when we were there I went into the restroom and a waitress came in behind me, she used the restroom and did not wash her hands before walking out the door, and was serving food when I came out.\n\nI understand that the theme of the restaurant is rustic but, the tables have food caked in the crevices of the table every time we visit and that is simply unhealthy.",0
"Whole Foods has been accommodating #EVFN for several months now. Typically, they are well prepared for us giving us discounts on food and beverages. I am a picky sushi eater and their sushi chef does a fabulous job on the caterpiller rolls he makes. \n\nThe wait staff knows many of us by name. They usually have to kick us out we stay so late. It is a nice place to relax and chat with friends, new and old. This is the \""go to\"" grocery store. \n\nJim in the wine department sets up wonderful tastings and always has an ear to listen to his customers. He will order wines that the store doesn't carry. \n\nThe store itself is clean and the staff are always willing to help.",3
"My personal favorite Thai place is Thai Style Noodle House on Spring Mountain or Fort Apache but I thought since this place was so close to my work Id come here for lunchtime. \n\nI definitely recommend this place for their lunch specials and this is my go-to place for your hour breaks or to-go. It's usually the same ladies that are working and there are usually only 2 working at a time and during lunch time it's really packed (almost every table is filled). I give the women a thumbs up for their service and the quick turnaround of getting our food after we order. After coming here so many times, the waiters remember the plates we want to order which is a plus for me and shows they care about their customers! I'm not sure which waiters the other reviews are speaking of but I've never had an issue with the service. \n\nTheir food is good but not the best Thai food I've ever tasted. I usually order their Pad Thai (Chicken), Yellow Curry, or Spicy Basil Leaf (Beef). However they are nice and I would continue to come here for lunch breaks. \n\nIf you like spicy, make sure you ask what chilies they have in stock. Some are more spicy than others and their 10 won't be the same every time you order, so be careful!",2
"This is the best wine/tapas bar in Madison ... Everything is really good here, with the exception of their sangria .. I have been to authentic Spanish places with good sangria .. theirs was extremely catered to the masses, think koolaid with alcohol and fruit.. I love their fritata dish, the goat cheese and marinara and I LOVVVVE their desserts, avoid this place when there are shows across the street it gets busy..",3
"Tout est dans le nom\n\nLe choix du nom est une \u00e9tape primordiale dans le d\u00e9veloppement d'un restaurant. Il repr\u00e9sente en g\u00e9n\u00e9ral le th\u00e8me, l'histoire ou le type de cuisine qui y sera rattach\u00e9. Bref, c'est l'identit\u00e9 du resto m\u00eame qui est repr\u00e9sent\u00e9e en ces quelques mots qui se doivent d'\u00eatre accrocheurs. Certains attirent la client\u00e8le simplement avec leur nom; c'est le cas avec Chez Ma Grosse Truie Ch\u00e9rie, situ\u00e9 au coin de Papineau et Ontario.\n\nBouffe\n\nLe menu \u00e0 la carte est bien diversifi\u00e9, avec des choix allant du porc aux p\u00e9toncles, en passant par le lapin et le Foie gras. En entr\u00e9e, Mademoiselle et moi nous sommes partag\u00e9s le Plateau de cochonnailles artisanales (14$), compos\u00e9 entre autres de terrine de porcelet, saucisson au fromage de ch\u00e8vre, jambon blanc et de d\u00e9licieux oignons marin\u00e9s aux betteraves. Malgr\u00e9 la simplicit\u00e9 des charcuteries qui nous rappelle presque un sandwich jambon-moutarde vite fait, il y a ce je-ne-sais-quoi (aussi b\u00eate soit-il) qui nous fait appr\u00e9cier de manger une telle planchette au restaurant.\n\nComme plat principal, j'ai opt\u00e9 pour le Steak de porcelet (32$), couvert d'une onctueuse sauce aux champignons et servi avec frites au parmesan. Malgr\u00e9 la portion g\u00e9n\u00e9reuse et la viande bien tendre, je pense qu'une sauce moins grasse que de la mayo aurait \u00e9t\u00e9 appropri\u00e9e pour tremper mes frites (d\u00e9j\u00e0 au parmesan), histoire de rendre l'assiette l\u00e9g\u00e8rement moins lourde.\n\nMademoiselle, quant \u00e0 elle, a choisi le Surf n Turf de steak d'entrec\u00f4te et p\u00e9toncles fum\u00e9s (32$). \u00c0 l'inverse du steak qui \u00e9tait un peu fade et manquait de sauce, les p\u00e9toncles, d\u00e9pos\u00e9s sur une pur\u00e9e de c\u00e9leri-rave, \u00e9taient parfaitement cuits et couverts d'un succulent coulis \u00e0 l'\u00e9rable.\n\nService/Ambiance\n\nC\u00f4t\u00e9 service, rien \u00e0 reprocher, ce fut parfait du d\u00e9but \u00e0 la fin. Merci Julien.\n\nL'ambiance de Chez Ma Grosse Truie Ch\u00e9rie est un peu plus compliqu\u00e9e \u00e0 expliquer, compte tenu de ses diff\u00e9rentes salles. En effet, le restaurant cherche \u00e0 s\u00e9parer les plus gros groupes des couples ou familles, ce qui n'est pas n\u00e9cessairement une mauvaise chose. Le hic, c'est que \u00e7a semble \u00eatre laisser au bon jugement de l'h\u00f4tesse et en tant que jeune couple, on pr\u00e9f\u00e9rerait \u00eatre dans l'action, plut\u00f4t que de se sentir mal \u00e0 l'aise \u00e0 c\u00f4t\u00e9 d'un groupe de personnes d'un certain \u00e2ge. Bref, il faut y aller pour voir, ce resto vaut tout de m\u00eame le d\u00e9tour !\n\nCool\n\n- Bonnes portions\n- La d\u00e9co\n- Id\u00e9al pour les groupes\n\nBof \n\n- Prix relativement \u00e9lev\u00e9s",2
"Can you say \""seedy\""?  That's what this place appeared to be in first impressions.  The bar itself is steps below classy, and a step above \""dive\"" but it was the characters hanging around that really made the place gross.  We walk in through the side door from the parking lot and there's two dogs (adorable) lying by a dirty backpack and a water bowl.  And then we notice the homeless guy who comes up to us trying to bum cigarettes.  We tell him that we don't smoke, jokingly quip that smoking is bad for you, and he looked like he was about to blow his freakin' top.  Also, he kept making drug references.  We quickly realize this isn't our \""crowd\"". \n\nNow the drinks here were reasonably priced, there's the obligatory slot machines at the bar, good service from the bartender, and a decently clean bar environment.  I love a good dive and I'd say this is more than just that.  I suppose you can't really control the clientele unless they're really bugging or harming others (or if they're just too drunk) but the customers here made my friends, who were visiting from back east, very uncomfortable.  I work nearby and I guess I'm used to the characters who hang out around this area. But even I was uncomfortable. \n\nI honestly don't think I'll be back but if you threw this bar into my neck of the woods in Henderson I'd be there, like, every day.",1
"My boyfriend and I stop in here for dinner quite often while in Las Vegas. Chateaubriand w/ asparagus and au-gratin potatoes is on hit! Incredible wine list and their wait staff is extremely friendly. They don't have late hours like other restaurants, I think they close around 10 or 11pm (which is way early) but still a good place to check out.",3
"Great hip place to go when you are in the mood for upscale modern Latin fair. I wish I could remember the name of our waiter, he was phenomenal. Really excellent service. \n\nMy two favorite things were the table side guacamole and the bread pudding. Seriously, the bread pudding is to die for... I highly recommend it... even if you THINK you don't like bread pudding. \n\nI'd suggest going here for a girls night out or on a date. The bar was packed when we got there as well. Overall the food was good, the desert was ridiculous and the service was excellent.",2
"There's no point in making a reservation at Breadfruit if they won't honor it.  Or to be more precise, they should be less deceptive about taking your reservation.  In our case, we were given the impression that we'd have to wait about 20 minutes for our little group.  On the phone they did tell us that there was another party ahead of us.  What they didn't tell us was that it would really be more like the 20 minutes times 3 for the four adults and two kiddos.  When we made our way in, the place was half full, but four two-tops were open and a large table for six was reserved.  Not for us, of course, and nobody was leaving anytime soon.\n\nWhile we waited, a party of two walked in and was seated.  A few minutes later, another two-top near them turned over.  A little forward thinking would have been to seat the two at one of the other open tables, and put the other now free tables together.   It would have been a tight fit, but it could have worked.\n\nNeedless to say, The Breadfruit is small.  There is no waiting area and with the kiddos we weren't going to wait outside in the drizzle.  We waited in a hallway that lead to the bathroom until we couldn't wait anymore.  In the end we walked out.  One star for the cute ambiance but for nothing else.",0
"Meh. This place very much lacks the excitement.  I guess for a child, it should be okay, but even the kids that I brought along did not come out of there with smiles on their faces.  Instead, they had lackluster exclamations of... blah.  Just mere, utter BLAH.  Oh well.  \n\nI guess, Chuck e Cheese next time?",1
"A nice little aquarium in Mandalay Bay Hotel. The walk there from the entrance of the hotel is a bit of a walk, but you can do it! It costs about $17 for adults and $12 for children to get in. \n\nOnce you enter they take a few pictures of you so you can view them at the end before you leave and decide on if you want to purchase them as souvenirs. =] \n\nIts cool getting to see the different animals up close. I don't go to aquariums often so everything was new and exciting to see. They even had tunnels that you walked through that made you feel as if you were walking through the water! It's always cool to see sharks swimming above you!\n\nThere's also a small stingray pond where you can touch the stingrays. My excitement for that lasted for about 2 seconds. Lol. But I know it's more for the kiddies. \n\nI'd say the best part of the aquarium would be at the very end where they have sections where you walk on top of glass and can see the fish below you. If you find it trippy and chicken out, then TOO BAD because that's the only way out of that place. Lol. So good luck!",2
"Had lunch here a couple of days ago.  \n\nPlace was dead.  Only one other table had people at it.  Service was quick.  Reuben sandwich I ordered was delivered promptly.  Meat was tasty but not exactly plentiful (I'm used to a New York style Reuben - with loads of meat).  Potato salad that came with the sandwich was very good, a pleasant surprise.  \n\nOutdoor seating was nice, though the birds did get tiresome.  Place seemed clean.  Plenty of seats.  Upstairs deck area would be great in the evening.  Seems like it would be a much more fun place with a group of people for happy hour  or dinner than it was for lunch.  \n\nBottom line - it was okay.  Not bad, not great.  I'd give it another try but I wouldn't go out of my way to eat there again.",2
"Totally solid.\nReally.\nReason it's not five stars... is the price!\nIMHO, there are other sushi bars in the PHX area, that are just as fresh and tasty, and not as $$$$\nI ended up spending $75 on food and drink, including tax and tip.\nWhile it was tasty, it wasn't that tasty.  I can find better for $30.",2
"Discovered this place from Yelp a few months ago..\nIt is really close to my work, so I find myself going there often.\nIt isn't close to where I live (in the North valley) but I have found myself making the 30 minute drive just to have lunch.\nThe hummus is out of this world! As is the Prima Chicken Sandwich.\nI have not been disappointed by anything from Pesto Prima.",4
I had a quattro pizza and a quarter of it -the quarter with salami-was good. The rest was pretty average-not horrible but not great either.  A bit pricey for the quality...,2
"I stopped in for lunch with a few co-workers. The place was pretty packed when we arrived which is always a good sign for a newbie! \n\nWhile we waited we checked out the menu and lunch specials. The prices for their lunch combos was pretty reasonable! Once we were finally seated we got the chips and salsa. I wasn't a fan of either, the chips were fine (I guess) but just not my personal favorite...and the salsa was way to watery for me! \n\nFor lunch I ordered the Ranchera quesadilla. It comes along side rice and beans, with your choice of chicken or ground beef and then gets topped with sour cream, guacamole, tomato and cheese.\n\nMy plate arrived to the table hot so that was a huge plus! The portion size was just right! But the chicken could have used a bit more seasoning, I wasn't a fan of the beans (covered in cheese) and the rice was a bit crunchy. \n\nBlah. \n\nSo for now this place is just okay! It's certainly not the best Mexican I've ever had but I'm at least willing to try another dish and a margarita and see if they can't win me over!",2
Wings were good but the blanco pizza with artichoke hearts and chicken was outstanding. Will be returning for a second round.,3
"When I feel like great mexican food, this place is as good as it gets, and I'm not even mexican (I'm central american).\n\n\nWhether its weekend or weekday for lunch, La Merced NEVER disappoints me.  Today I had a Chicken Mole plate and it was DELISH!  My second favorite dish here, during lunch rush, is 4 street tacos (2 lengua and 2 asada).  \n\nThe drinks are amazing too.  You can have an Horchata or a fruit drink that is blended right there while you wait.  I have a friend that always has to have the Strawberry water (without cream).  \n\nThe prices are decent, and the staff is always very friendly.  Some days I get an extra treat, and get to watch the Barcelona football match on TV.  \n\nToday there was a gentleman playing guitar during lunch hour (on a weekend), and he played a Man\u00e1 song for my cousin and I.  I had a great lunch, watching soccer, listening to great music, and enjoying a great Mole.  \n\nKeep up the work you guys.  For anyone not familiar with non-northern mexican food, this place has Mexico City Style mexican food...I would definitely recommend it.  Who knows, someday you may be qualified to try the Torta Gigante.  Which I've only had once because it is a huge deal.",4
"My dining partner was absolutely angry after getting his order. First of all, he said he wanted to go in, instead of going through the drive-thru, because he wanted to MAKE SURE they got his order right. But, no. He was very clear what he wanted, I repeated it to the cashier, and my dining partner repeated it and clarified, yet again.\nBut, no.\nMy order was fine.\nBut, no.\nDon't go here.",1
"Only ate here once; got the lightest ramen (chicken base?) with chicken cubes.  So tasty!  OK, so the noodles aren't homemade (hence the lack of 5th star) but was impressed with the takeout packaging.  The broth was kept separate from the noodles/veg/meat so I could combine them at home.  Huge portion, had enough for leftovers the next day.  The Bobo wasn't sweet enough for my liking, but I can ask for sugar next time.  I was also glad to find another Bobo joint.  I'm so going to be back!",3
"It's in the ghetto, but if you don't mind people being loud and yelling across the restaurant, this is one of the better Waffle Houses I've been to, and I've been to many throughout the south east. The waitress was very polite and attentive. She never let our glasses get empty. The cook, well, he was in a class all his own. Every item we were served was cooked go absolute perfection. My wife is very particular and makes a lot of special request, who h usually causes at least a few mistakes. I always ask for my waffle cooked light with my all star breakfast, which I rarely get. The cook here hit every mark we set. Given the chance, I would absolutely go back. \n The only reason I only gave 4 stars, not 5, is I prefer a quiet atmosphere. This place was loud even for a waffle house, especially since the weren't many people  there.",3
"Wow what a disappointment :(\nThe service was slow and the servers (attractive) paid more attention to the 2 other booths that had attractive men sitting at it. \nWe had a reservation for 5:00 pm and got seated at 5:20 pm.\nThe pretzel bread stick thingys were delicious but the only good thing about the meal.\nI ordered a filet. it was tough and had no flavor. I would have went to Applebee's if I wanted a steak that looked more like meatloaf.\nFor the $50 my portion cost I just wasn't happy.\nDoes anyone remember when they had a steak house called \""Kodiak\""? Those were the good ole days oh how I miss that place.",1
"The place was really busy we I walk into it, but I was still greeted very nicely.  The staff was very friendly, and it was cool to be able to watch them make the ice cream.  I order Chocolate peanut butter cup in a to a go container, a lot of ice cream  :)  When I got home we put the ice cream into the freezer (had to go to the store after), and in a couple of hours we were enjoying very tasty, creamy, and very good ice cream.  We will be back for sure.",4
"This is an unusual place which is good and bad. It's part bar / bookstore / hookah / whatever else happens to be going on. I went there just to hang out and it's a good thing I wasn't too hungry. I bought one of the pre-packaged sandwiches and it was quite old. The beer and wine selections are quite limited. The hookah is the draw.\nIf you're in the area, this isn't a bad place to drop by and see what (if anything) is happening. Otherwise, it's not worth the drive.",1
Went there for the first time on Saturday. Excellent example of a breakfast joint! Great portions..Food was good. The service staff was very friendly and attentative. Definately a quick in and out place for bkfst!! O...the parking lot confused me with the way your suppose to park. Think i'm crazy...go there and see what I mean! LOL,3
Great spot. Hung out with some really fun people who had a cabana so it was pretty chill. Good mixed crowd. Great music. I wish the inside of the club was happening but it was just outside around the pool area. The security was nice and it's a pretty setting on a warm Vegas night.,3
"Consulted him for setting up an estate plan.  First meeting was free, and he was informative.  We haven't made our decision yet, but he is definitely worth interviewing for the assignment.",2
"C'\u00e9tait lors d'une journ\u00e9e grise alors je me promenais sur la rue Saint-Laurent que je suis tomb\u00e9e par hasards sur la boutique Oh La La. Les couleurs fluorescentes, du jaune, du orange, du rose, du bleu, du vert, bref, toutes les couleurs imaginables, me sautaient aux yeux comme un joyeux rayon de soleil. J'avais l'impression que la vitrine m'appelait! J'y suis entr\u00e9e en pensant simplement regarder, mais en v\u00e9rifiant les prix j'ai \u00e9t\u00e9 agr\u00e9ablement surprise de voir que je pouvais me permettre de m'y acheter quelques morceaux. J'en ai donc profit\u00e9 pour commencer \u00e0 b\u00e2tir ma garde-robe du printemps avec des hauts qui sont \u00e0 la fois d\u00e9contract\u00e9s et assez chic pour des r\u00e9unions ou bien des sorties un peu plus chiques. Je suis ressortie avec un seul morceaux, mais j'ai d\u00e9j\u00e0 re\u00e7u tellement de compliments que je planifie y retourner d\u00e8s qu'il fera assez chaud pour me d\u00e9partir de mon veston de printemps.",3
"Went for my son's 15th birthday to enjoy lunch.  Sushi is his favorite.  This place is small and you have to go into the restaurant next door for the restroom.  The menu is fairly limited and expensive, in my opinion.  The service was average and the food was just okay.  I don't think we would bother to go back.",1
"Music was awful. MANN, seriously?\n\nTHe music was definitely not the business. Was a bit dead till it hit 12AM and even then, it wasn't as poppin as it should have been. And this was on a FRIDAY night. Definitely not crackin like TAO or XS. WOULD NOT COME BACK.",2
"Kaizen... What can I say? This place blew my mind. Beautiful restaurant and BEAUTIFUL food. Some of the highest quality sushi and maki I have ever had in my life - and this girl has consumed an obscene amount of sushi! Fresh fish, incredible flavour combinations... Some highlights from my time there would include the sea urchin tempura, the Montreal roll (the fresh mandarin orange is a surprising and delicious touch), and the LBC roll. LBC - lobster/black cod - is the crown jewel on my ~10 years of sushi experience. The fish is so perfectly cooked, I was ready to trade in my entire plate for another order of these babies. Don't ask me how they manage to make something so succulent in such a compact form... well worth the $25 for eight pieces of heaven.\n\nThe service was more than decent, and the waiter gave our party a fantastic mid-priced sake recommendation - something I so regret not having written down. And the second time I went there, though we arrived right before the kitchen closed, they were very accommodating. They were out of tempura batter, but gave both me and my date free desserts as compensation (even though it was our fault for not bothering to check the restaurant's hours before showing up so close to closing time!). Yes, Kaizen is pretty pricey, but my experiences there have proven that the expense is well worth it. A definite must if you find yourself in Montr\u00e9al and craving top quality cuisine.\n\nAlso, in response to other reviewers' complaints about the service - this place embraces the French attitude of restaurant service, and by that I mean they will not bother you until you ask them to. If you want the bill, you need to ask for it. This should not be considered a negative about this place - it's merely a cultural thing that you need to be aware of before you go. Punishing a place with a low review based on cultural norms is ridiculous, and I think Kaizen has struck a healthy balance for anglophiles and francophiles alike.",4
I ordered from here last weekend and so far so good.  I ordered two things and the volume of food was so much that I actually didn't run out until last night.  To me that's pretty impressive to order something and be able to make it stretch for dinner every night of the week for 6 days straight.  Considering the volume I'd say the price wasn't bad either.\n\nThey accept credit cards and delivery was pretty speedy.  They told me by phone 45 minutes and actually were there within 25 minutes.  So sooner than I thought it would be.\n\nI'd say I'm going to order here again for sure.,3
"New favorite place in Madison! The must-try Sunday $5 \""Bloody Mary & Cow\"" was perfect for a Sunday Afternoon.... A delicious & unique spin on a classic! The Hawaiian Pork was seriously amazing, as was the mashed sweet potato casserole (just make sure they still have some!) The bartenders are super friendly & take good care of their customers. I highly recommend a visit!",4
"Good spot to get a coffee,  but the attitude of some of the baristas need to remember that they are there to make coffee. My friend and I were both told what we wanted would take awhile instead of saying it will be longer than usual,  it's like they dreaded the thought of brewing coffee....aye",3
We had a great dinner. Food was delicious and service was a joy.\n\nTake advantage of their happy hour (until 8 pm) and you get discounts on beer and cocktails as well as some of the meals on the menu.\n\nI would recommend it to friends any time.,3
"Great place. Sushi was not wrapped up tied enough so it tended to fall apart. Also the roll was a bit thick that it is hard to fit it in your mouth (yeah, that's what she said:)",3
"A little pricey for what you get, but a cute shop close to the action on campus.  Baristas were a little cranky, but not overly so.",2
"I have always enjoyed coming to Bosa, but this past visit I encountered an extremely rude employee. She did not have any manners what so ever & as we paid at the drive-thru window she did not say one word to us just handed us our order & receipt. She was way to busy having a loud conversation with someone else inside of the store. HORRIBLE. I am giving five stars because I love Bosa's pastries & have had good visits here in the past, but this one employee was just incredibly rude & had absolutely no customer service.",4
"If you want some simple greasy breakfast food and you're staying in the Flamingo, this place is good enough. The eggs & bacon breakfast is pretty good and the hashbrowns are tasty. \n\nTheir burgers and wings however, are very simple and lackluster. I suppose if I was drunk and needed some buffalo wings in my belly (which is known to happen), these would suffice, but by no means should anyone go out of their way for them. For the burgers either.",1
Food was ok they didn't bring out my friends meal about 15 minutes after mine it wasn't hot. Highlights greens although don't add salt. Waffle tasted like a piece of fish had been dropped in the batter but that was only one bite. Overall I'll be looking for a different place next time I eat in the area.,0
"A very last minute trip brought me to Montreal and of course to my original disappointment I couldn't get a table at any of the places I had my heart set on; however the two of us foodies watched the disappointment disappear as we started our meal at Bar & Boeuf.  The Sommelier had a strong knowledge of the mainly European wine section and helped guide us to something that matched well with what we were ordering.  The king mushrooms and scallops both were average compared to the MUST try main course of the PIG CHUCK.  WOW is all I can say and no knife required for this great dish.  If you're a foodie it's worth checking out.  The atmosphere was solid; it wasn't so loud you couldn't carry on a conversation with someone next to you, but it had a vibe.",3
WAY TOO OVERPRICED! My girlfriend and I called ahead of time to verify the price for lunch ($16.95) & ask if they served short ribs. Turns out that the short ribs are dinner only so we ended up paying $56.10 total for the two of us. It was pretty good & they did have sushi & a few other buffet foods (which weren't that good). They also DID NOT have rice paper or any kind of sauce to dip the meat in. The service was less than average. I would not recommend going here when there's lot of other k bbq places in the area.,1
"Last weekend, I came here for a friend's birthday party. We had the whole back section of the restaurant. I won't review the beers, but I know they are fantastic. I've had them before. I love them.\n\nFrom the moment you walk into San Tan, you are surrounded by a friendly vibe. It reminds you of that clean, fun, neighborhood bar. \n\nI am not too familiar with the menu, because for this party, the food was set up in the back--self serve style. Tacos, Enchiladas, and Guacamole. All were fantastic. I was able to nibble on everything and everything was FULL of flavor. Particularly the shrimp. \n\nThe staff was very friendly and fun. When our party asked for a variety of shots, the bartenders were happy to oblige and use their creativity. The staff had a solid knowledge of craft beers and could pair beers with the foods. \n\nIn the words of Yelp....Yay! I'm a fan!",3
Best Tortas so far. Good Quality.,4
"Ridiculously gigantic portion sizes. I could get at least 3 and possibly 4 hearty meals out of anything I've ever had here. If 3 people could agree on one entree, no one would go hungry. \n\nGreat burgers. Some great salads. But for some reason, it's just not my favorite place. I think the portions freak me out.",2
"Came here once before and really enjoyed it, so we came back.  This time we ordered the Vietnamese vegan sandwiches, I ordered the spicy chicken and he ordered the crispy chicken with avocado sandwich.  I didn't read the menu posted on the wall before I ordered, I just ordered off the regular menu so didn't know what came in the sandwiches.  I don't really like pickles or too much pickled items but don't mind a little daikon, shredded carrots and cilantro in my sandwiches.  My sandwich had some pickled peppers or pickled something which I had to take out.  I liked his crispy chicken sandwich much better.  I probably would've enjoyed my sandwich a lot more if the sandwich had cilantro, which I didn't realize it was missing until I was done.i also would've probably enjoyed the sandwich more if it came with some sort if side, either some sort of fries or veggies or soup...just something, my sandwich looked lonely. But I did give an extra star for the fact that they have a soy milk option for their boba drinks, nice!",3
"Been here 3 times, enjoyed it each time.\n\nThis time we had the prix fixe menu. So much food, could not finish it all.\n\nGreat food, great view, great service.",3
"Char's is a classic dive but I like it and keep coming back. It always has good live bands and enthusiastic crowds. It is one of the best places to listen to funky R&B. On the downside, they seem to have the same 3 or 4 bands play there, and there is very little variety of music styles. Char's music has become very predictable, although quality is not an issue. \n\nIt's one of the few place in the Valley where you can dance to live music every day of the week until 1 am!\n\nService is friendly and fairly fast considering how crowded the place can get.\n\nThe patrons are a diverse crowd in terms of race but are probably mostly over the age of 35. Lots of interracial dancing which I find to be one of the coolest things about Char's. \n\nSo, now for the negatives:\n\nTheir blown out sound system needed to be upgraded a decade ago. \n\nThe dance floor is heavily worn and is far too small for anything but stationary hip grinding (except the rare occasions when there are only one or two couples on the floor). There is no stage for the bands so they often overflow onto the small dance floor. \n\nThere are too few choices of draft beer, although what they have is good. \n\nBathrooms are fairly disgusting. \n\nParking is problematic. \n\nChar's should have been out of business years ago but they have become a tradition.",2
"Good and one of the few places on the strip where you can get full or under $10. I'm not a fan of the snap/almost crunch of the dogs, but the toppings are plentiful and the prices are reasonable for VEGAS. I went mid afternoon and waited 5 minutes, I'm a pretty big guy and ordered two dogs...mistake! One is plenty, like I said not my favorite type of dog, but what they do they do well, I'll probably be back.",2
"They fixed my iPhone 5s screen that I shattered a few days ago. The facility was nice, a bit busy so I recommend going first thing if you want to get it back in 30mins, mine took 90min. The staff was really nice and helpful and the service and speed was amazing.",4
"The newspaper review posted at the entrance says that sometimes a diner is just a diner, and that seems to be what Hanlon's aspires to, but not a very good one.  \n\nWent for Sunday breakfast on a recent trip with the family, and found that most of the food lacked flavor.  The sausage breakfast burrito lacked any punch, the home fries were soggy and bland.  Even my 8 year old said the raisin French toast lacked flavor.\n\nOn the plus side, the prices were extremely reasonable.  Breakfast for 4 under $20.",1
"Service has been pretty good.  Onion rings, cheese fries, wings, and burgers have all been good.  Decent beer selection",3
"Why is everyone voting 4 stars?? haha.  this place is awesome, I've been here more then 5 times.  They have a great deal which is like 3 rolls for 23 dollars or so(specialty rolls) and that should be more then enough for yourself depending on the roll.  I have never been to the hibachi but I'm sure thats good too!.  and the waitresses are cute too!  ;).",4
"So this place has a big, fancy name to live up to -- I guess it's owned by one of the judge's on Top Chef or something...\n\nI tried this place a few weeks ago while on vacation in Vegas. Unfortunately, I was really disappointed.\n\nThe decor, the wait-staff, the ambiance -- I figured this place was going to rock. But when the food came out and I took the first few bites, I was surprised to see how AVERAGE the food was. Honestly, I could have eaten as good at a place in the Bay for 1/10 the cost. A dinner for four girls ended up being nearly $500 (yes, we did get two bottles of wine, but neither were more than $50)...\n\nI felt this place was completely over-priced for the quality of its food. I guess the place has a great \""name,\"" and I think my friends loved it because they felt like they were 'supposed to,' but steer clear! SO many better places to eat in Sin City (and for so much cheaper).",1
Ok...so I am updating this due to the owner contacting me. He has been diligent on replying and getting things sorted out and making my situation fair. Stay tuned as to how everything turns out...at least he is trying...,0
"All I can say about Pizza People is, WOW!  Yummy pizza at a yummy price:D I never eat my crust, because it's usually never good enough. But it's all about the dough at this little food truck! They took their time in creating it and it shows! I especially love the names they chose for some of their pizzas, like \""testosteroni\"" (spelling?) but it's a meat pizza made with a local favorite, Schreiner's fine sausage.I could of ate two, Incredible! They also have vegan options which is a great plus. And starting at $6 bucks a pizza, you can't beat it!  The owners of this food truck are Marybeth and Tim. A couple that is wonderfully friendly and inviting. I hope that you get a chance to check out their wonderful product and give them a great review!\n\nCheers!",4
"That's not a Hilton, it's a cheap hotel at best with a Hilton sign. Very unfriendly desk clerks, no restaurant inside. The rooms are just regular and so was the service. If you step inside the hotel, the first thing you will notice is, it doesn't look like a Hilton hotel at all! We payed US$99 the night thinking that this was a bargain for a Hilton. Big mistake. It wasn't worth that much. I would have payed US$ 40-50 for this hotel, not a cent more.\n\nIf you want tell your friends home, that you have been staying at \""Hilton\"", then do it. Because this is just about the name. The Hotel itself is just regular, sometimes even worst.\n\nI have complained about some things that went wrong when I was checking out. She didn't just care. If you must name yourself \""Hilton\"",  I recommend another name for that hotel:\n\n\""First Cheap Motel ever licenced by Hilton\"".\n\nSo people would know what to expect.",0
"My wife and I celebrated our 10th anniversary at this wonderful fine dining restaurant. The experience can only be described with one word, \""wow.\"" A good friend of ours recommended this special restaurant for our special occasion. Walking into the front door, we totally forgot that this restaurant is situated inside a busy and noisy casino. We were greeted by a warm smile and led to our seats. Our seats were out in the Vertical Garden surronded by green ivy going up on the wall.\n\nWe were handed two menus for select from. One menu is the 16 course degustation menu for $385 per person and a prix fixe menu that ranges from 2 course to 6 course meal to choose from. You really cannot go wrong with either menu. Since our reservation is at 8:30 pm, we thought the 16 course menu may go on too long. I decided to go with the 4 course and my wife went with the 2 course. The waiter were very helpful assisting us with our menu selections. My 4 course meal selection were Le Foie Gras duo m\u00eal\u00e9 d'artichaut violet en salade aux copeaux de parmigiano reggiano (Foie gras and violet artichoke salad with parmesan shavings) for appetizer, La Ch\u00e2taigne et le foie gras dans un fin velout\u00e9 soyeux sur un voile virtuel de lard fum\u00e9 (Light chestnut velout\u00e9 with foie gras, smoked lardons foam) for soup, Le Bar et poulpe aux fins aromates avec un jus de citronnelle, jeunes poireaux et artichaut (Pan fried sea bass and octopus with lemon grass, baby leek and artichoke) for main course and La Banane givr\u00e9e et caramelis\u00e9e au vieux rhum ambr\u00e9 et une \u00e9mulsion cr\u00e9meuse de lait de coco (Banana and passion fruit cream under a dark rum granit\u00e9 and coconut foam) for dessert. My wife selected Le Homard en salade mimosa de chou-fleur fondant \u00e0 l'aigre doux et des cro\u00fbtons dor\u00e9s (Lobster salad with sweet and sour cauliflower mimosa and croutons) for appetizer, Le B\u0153uf la noix d'entrec\u00f4te \u00e9minc\u00e9e, \u00e9pinards au wasabi et l\u00e9gumes arlequins (Beef ribeye, wasabi spinach and a medley of bell peppers) for main course and Le Chocolat grand cru \u00e0 la glace Arabica, riz souffl\u00e9 aux zestes de citron confit (Guanaja chocolate with coffee ice cream, caramelized puffed rice and lemon confit) for dessert.\n\nAfter the tough menu selection, we then faced more choices. The waiter pushed the Le Pain (bread cart) with at least 20 different type of bread to select from. Then it came as a surprise, with the bread the waiter brought out Le Caviar to go with the bread. This is really the first time my wife and I had caviar, and it was excellent. I don't want to get into the detail of each dish that we had for reasons that one, I am not a food critic and two, you have to have it yourself to really know how wonderful each dish were. After the dessert, the waiter came by to show us this beautiful anniversary cake complimentary of the chief. The cake were to die for. Just when we thought that we could not be surprised any more, the waiter push Les Mignardises (charcolate cart) with over 42 different gourment charcolates.\n\nThe night was filled with surprises and excitment. I am so glad that we spent our 10th anniversary at this fantastic restaurant.",4
"This is my new favorite sushi place in the Valley of the Sun. Great prices, fresh,  and awesome service.  Overall very happy.",4
Close to my house and had good pad thai. :),3
I will honestly never go anywhere else. This place has the best customer service and is always amazingly fast and thorough. The quality and price are second to none and I never feel pressured or upsold. The employees are rad and just want to give you what you NEED at the most affordable price to keep your car running safe and sound. Yesterday I was literally out of there in less than 20 minutes. LOVE Lightning Lube!,4
"I was looking forward to a great experience and a great meal.  I was by myself and decided to eat at the bar.  Upon entering I was greeted by a friendly hostess who I asked if I could go to the bar and she said yes, it's open seating.  She could have walked me over if she really wanted to impress, but hey...\n\nUpon entering the bar, I was quite disappointed with the ambiance or lack thereof.  When you go to a nice steakhouse especially the bar, you don't expect it brightly lit and plainly decorated - plain painted walls and poorly positioned tv's that were not large enough to view from where they were positioned way off to the far corners of a very tall ceiling.  \n\nYou expect hip and fashionable with good music and vibe.  Especially when you ar paying $10 and up per drink...\n\nThe night was more of a disappointment from there.  I was given a menu and a wine menu but never asked if I wanted to order a drink.  I finally had to ask the bartender, a guy on the shorter side, not that it matters, who seemed to be too busy socializing with the waitresses and staff than to consider my drink order.\n\nI will say he was a friendly guy and I can see why he was so popular with the staff b/c all he did was socialize with them over and over again.  \n\nUltimately, he suggested the petite filet over the Scottish Salmon which he said was wild caught.  I went with his suggestion and asked for it medium which he said would be pink in the middle which I said was fine. \n\nI also ordered the tomato salad w/beets and was disappointed with the arugula as it appeared a bit wilted and the tomatoes were not chilled which they need to be to make this salad good.  Same with the room-temp beets.  Dressing was decent.\n\nI was working on my salad when the female bartender came over to me and asked me if I was done with my salad which I clearly was \nnot.  It was awkward b/c my steak was ready as one of the servers had come out and told her as I could see them conferring off to the side of the bar.  I told her I would be ready in a couple of mins and then realized that I should have probably just let them bring it out.  \n\nAfter finally getting her attention back, I asked to have it brought out.  Five mins later I was presented with a petite filet that clearly had been sitting on a hot plate and under a heat lamp as it was quite dry.  It also was a disappointing cut and had some fat on one side which I have never experienced before at a fine steakhouse...disappointing to say the least.  I also ordered the saut\u00e9ed spinach with oil, no butter and that was pretty good.  There were red onions in it which I typically don't like, but these were well-cooked and seasoned to my liking so I ate them.\n\nI had asked for a glass of Pinot Noir to accompany my steak and he recommended a glass of the PREDATOR\nZinfandel Lodi Old Vine, 2012/13.  It was hugely oaky and frankly the most overbearing red I have ever had.  I asked him to smell the bouquet or even try a sip.  It's then that he admitted he had never tried it.  Why would he recommend something he had never tried.  The wine was terrible so he poured me a glass of the Syrah which was much better.\n\nI looked at a menu nearby and saw that Flemings is part if a broader chain and then realized what I was dealing with.  It is their highest end brand I believe and I don't think it is being closely watched from the corporate offices; at least not this one.\n\nI finished my meal and the plates sat there for a good 20 mins without being cleared.  This is at the bar, mind you where the staff is basically on top of you by design.  I finally asked him for a refill on my water and 5 mins later he filled it for me after taking care of several other customers first.\n\nOn the positive side, the waiter suggested I not try the Chocolate Lava Milkshake since I told him I had to be up at 4 a.m. the next morning and had a trip to Hawaii  planned the following month.  With just that advice  I avoided a hangover as well as likely close to 10,000 calories.  He scored back some points for that one.\n\nAll in all, a lot of money for a average meal with no ambiance...likely wouldn't go back and wouldn't recommend it until managment instills a higher level of professionalism in the staff.",1
"My first experience at Bobby's has left me less than excited to come back, and certain aspects of my visit were downright terrible. Let me explain... \n\nSeveral friends and I decided to head to Bobby's for happy hour on Friday night. Four of us arrived at 5pm, and we were expecting 2 more. When we walked in, the ambiance of the place was really nice. It had a cool vibe to it, and cool wall hangings and lighting, so my first impression was pretty good. When we walked upstairs to the bar, we were informed that only the high-top tables were available for happy hour. They were all 4 person tables, and we knew we would have at least 6 people. We sat down at one of the tables, and asked our server if it would be possible to add two more chairs. She was hesitant, but then suggested we move two tables together instead. That was fine by us. But instead of pushing a table to the one we were already seated at, they pushed two others together that were closer to the walkway and stairs. Once together, we got up and moved. Not 5 minutes later, the manager stomped over to us and said (pretty heatedly) \""you guys can't sit here, you're right in the way. This isn't going to work\"". He didn't offer a solution, and was extremely accusatory. I informed him that his servers had been the one to relocate us, and he just repeated \""this isn't going to work\"". Finally, he told us we could move to one of the regular tables and still get the happy hour deals, so the servers moved two more tables together, and we moved again. FINALLY, we were settled and began ordering our drinks and food. Shortly thereafter, we had two more friends join....and then two more that had never told us they were coming. So we added chairs for them and made room. Immediately after doing so, the manager came storming back over, and pulled our server aside. He was gesturing angrily and pointing at our table, and you'd think we'd committed some sort of atrocity with the was he was glaring at us. Let me include an aside - I get that it messes with the flow of the restaurant when patrons move chairs or tables from where they are normally located. HOWEVER, the place was half empty. Not once during the entire evening was every table filled. In addition, everyone at our table ordered multiple drinks and appetizers, so it's not as if we had space fillers that were not producing any income. After the manager finished yelling at our server, I called her over to apologize to her for the inconvenience. It wasn't her fault, and there was no reason the manager should have been so angry with her (or us, for that matter). Finally, we were done, and the bill came. We each put our share in, and the server took the bill to the back. When she returned, she handed out the credit card slips. Mine was for approximately $22, and she gave me mine without comment. I just discovered today, though, that she originally ran my card for the entire bill of almost $200! She apparently canceled it out, but because it was input into the system, it is still showing as a pending item in my bank account, which is $200 less than it should be now. It would have been nice if the server had mentioned that, rather than be surprised by it now 4 days later. Who knows how long it will take to fall out of pending status, and what if I had needed that money for something else??? \n\nIn addition to this horrible experience, I will add that the food was nothing more than average. The cheese tortellini was extremely bland, and the crab cakes in the crab cake and lobster ravioli dish tasted just like frozen fish sticks. The bruschetta was pretty good, but it's pretty hard to mess up tomatoes on toast. \n\nOverall, this visit was sub-par, and I'm not sure I'll be going back anytime soon.\n\nUpdate - After writing this review, I felt it necessary to contact the owner and let them know what happened.  I explained the situation, and the owner was profusely apologetic and assured me she would take the necessary steps to ensure that this didn't happen again.  She invited me to come back and give them another chance, and I will.  I'll let you know how it goes....",1
"The buffet wasn't great- and we didn't even have to pay because it was comped by the hotel so I shouldn't really complain.\n\nIt was just \""OK\"" food, I've had better for sure.\n\nOthers who said that hot items weren't kept hot were dead on... we actually read the Yelp reviews before heading to dinner but we figured if we got there right as the dinner buffet started (4pm) we would get the food while it was hot and freash. No such luck.\n\nThe Bread Pudding was REALLY GOOD though!",1
"I stayed here in May, it was okay.  The room, although non-smoking reeked of smoke, but was clean.  The hotels are a walk from the main entrance though, so bring a rolling suitcase! \n\nTOO many children, which I find hilarious since they have the party pit with the half naken women dancing around on stage (which is rather entertaining none-the-less). \n\nWe didn't have any luck at this casino though and the table hands were unfriendly.  I always like to have friendly table hands who help make gambling fun.  Even if I'm losing money, if I'm having fun I'll stay a while.  It's no fun to lose money with no smiling though haha.  \n\nDick's Last Resort is a must visit for those not faint of hear (NOT KID FRIENDLY).  It's my favorite restaurant and probably Excalibur's redeeming factor.  If not for this restaurant they would probably only get 2 stars from me.\n\nIn the end, you get what you pay for.  It's cheap and it will do.  Who really spends that much time in their own room in Vegas anyways?",2
"We walked around Old Montreal for part of our day and I feel like it would be more fun any other time of year besides winter. There wasn't much going on besides skating and horse-drawn carriage rides. The skating was pretty good, just a bit busy. It's quaint with cobblestone streets, cute store signs, and nice views of the water. \n\nLots of little shops, art galleries, and cafes to check out. So a nice place to go for charm and walking--be sure to wear flats.",2
"Had my Taco' in for service five times since I owned it:\n1. First day owning it I was getting an engine warning I found I had no gas cap - they gave me a new one, but forgetting to include a gas cap?  \n2. First week owning I had a tire air pressure warning - took them four visits to fix the leak over a two week period\n3. Oil change with an appointment - took 2 hours while I sat and waited  \n4. Oil change dropped it off  - when I returned it took them a half an hour to find my truck, and they forgot to wash it as offered\n5. Oil change dropped it off  - had to wait over a half hour for the 'valet' to get my truck.  Oh yeah, they forgot to wash as offered again. They asked if I wanted to wait while they 'washed it up'.  I think not.\n\nService here is awful in my experience.  The only reason I gave them a two star is the oil changes are free.",1
"Two hours before hubby's business meeting, i dragged him to this restaurant.  He didn't' look very happy when he saw the long line outside of the restaurant, but i insisted that either this or no brunch.  Thirty minutes later, we were finally seated, ten minutes later, our nice waiter took our order, 20 minutes later, our food came, 5 minutes later, husband said very good food and ran out of the door to his meeting.\n\nOn the other hand, my brunch was quite a pleasant experience.  The menu is quite extensive.  Our waiter was very nice and helpful.  He recommended steak and eggs Benedict, and that was very delicious.  I had chorizo omelet and that was just a-ok.  each meal comes with grilled potatoes and some fresh fruits.  I'd say the meal worth the wait.",3
"I made a salad for a late dinner here and sat down to eat it in their food court, a few bites from finishing my meal the manager came over to ask me to leave because they just closed... Walking out he replied to the register that \""he is finishing now\"" which I replied, no, I wasn't, you wouldn't let me remember?, which he snookered, \""sorry, I can't let people go till everyone is gone.\"" As I finished my last few bits in my truck, I watched the last few customers leave. Why he couldn't let me finish my meal is beyond me, but fuck this store. Can't I give less then 1 star?",0
better than most buffets in vegas.  \n\nskip the dessert unless you really love sugar... like lots of them!,3
"well, I must confess, Free is FREE.  So no complaints here.  However, I beg of you Harrah's casino family - Please update this hotel!  \n\nIt's very centrally located on the Strip and it was CLEAN and everyone was very nice but man, does it need a facelift.  I kid you not - the TV in the room must have been like a 17\"" tube tv.  Come on - even the local Holiday Inn has upgraded to at the very least a bigger tv, or a flat screen.  I felt that it could easily turn into the now closed Sahara.",2

"Stopped in on a Sunday night. Place is very clean. The family running shop were very friendly. I got the Bionico which was massive! Lots of everything - fruit variety, coconut, granola, cream and ice cream. It really was a 2 man dish. I could barely eat half, had to save the rest for later. It seemed pricey for $6.50 but is was so huge it could easily more then fill 2 adults. Will be trying other stuff soon. I liked it better then Fruitlandia in Mesa.",3

"Je commence \u00e0 connaitre les bons dumplings \u00e0 Montr\u00e9al. Ceux-ci sont d\u00e9finitivement excellents. Tr\u00e8s bon service, menu simple avec les classiques. Pas vraiment d'options v\u00e9g\u00e9tariennes. Les options v\u00e9g\u00e9tariennes sur le menu ont des crevettes. RESPECT! C'est evidemment tr\u00e8s peu dispendieux et tr\u00e8s frais. La diff\u00e9rence en Qing Hua qui est la comp\u00e9tion en terme de Dumpling fait \u00e0 la main, minute, c'est 1: Menu simplifi\u00e9, pas de buns mais la qualit\u00e9 des ingr\u00e9dients est sup\u00e9rieures et le r\u00e9sultat superbe aussi. Qing Hua, c'est tr\u00e8s bon, grosse quantit\u00e9, trop de truc sur le menu ce qui fait qu'on perd un peu en qualit\u00e9 VS Mai Xiang Yuan. \n\nJ'ai pris - \u00e0 deux - les dumplings a la vapeur au champignon et oignon et chevette , LEs champignon frais, tr\u00e8s bon. Ensuite les dumplings au boeuf au currry et oignon frits et agneau et coriandre. En entr\u00e9e la salade de m\u00e9duse et concombre. La joie de ce repas est dans le fait que chaque dumping qui arrivait au fur et a mesure qu'on terminait l'assiette \u00e9tait meilleur que le pr\u00e9c\u00e9dent. Quoi de mieux qu'un repas qui est toujours meilleur au fur et a mesure que nous sommes servit, Sans aucun doute raisonable un des meilleurs repas \u00e0 moins de 20$ par personne que je peux trouver \u00e0 Montr\u00e9al. Tout genre confondus. Et Oui! Burgers et Pizzas, Watch out, ces dumplings offre un moment de joie gustatives subtiles et d\u00e9liquintescent.",4
"I have frequented this place several times over the years and they have become hit or miss here recently.  I really think it depends on the day and who is cooking that will determine how good your meal will be.  I use to like coming here prior to panther games but on this visit the only thing that was on point was the fruit punch.......not a good look.  I had baked chicken, mac n cheese and green beans for $10.....it's also the same price for a toddler(really people?)......dry chicken, tasteless mac n cheese and canned green beans........they have got to step it up before I even think about returning.",1

My car guy friend called them to get a price for my car to be diagnosed and he got $148. That was pretty messed. We specifically asked them if they had the software to code parts for newer mecedes, they said yes. Then I had my car towed there. They told me I would get a diagnosis and quote the next day. I didn't. When I called them the following day, they quoted me all my work. I looked over the invoice and called the guy back a couple hours later to tell him what I wanted to do and he didn't tell me when the car would be ready. I called the next day to see when it would be ready, they said tomorrow. They called me today to say actually we need 3 more days because they have to send out the part to be coded. They blatantly lied about this. They said they could code it when in fact they couldn't. If I'm spending over 2 grand at your store, underpromise and overdeliver. These guys are more overpromise and underdeliver. If you are looking for a Mercedes shop who can code their parts, this is NOT the place to go. Very disappointed in my experience.",1
"I went to Biggs to rent a lens for my Canon XSi. Biggs is in a nice area--although it's sort of on the fringe of leaving it. It's a camera store, so who cares. The inside of the store is old, but clean, with a equipment wall to wall. I was greeted by a warm gentleman who gave me the lens, and had us on or way in 10 minutes. We rented a Canon 100-400 lens. The lens was a mess. It was old and it showed. The lens was squeaky, and it decided to stop zooming and make crunching noises until it worked again 5 minutes later. The whole lens was just a disappointment. I would return to Biggs only if I needed a lens rental and was in desperation.",2
I like this place alot.. Me and my boyfriend go alot to watch football games on sundays. Great tv set ups. Food isnt bad. Service is good. Nice place near my house. Only thing is booths are not that comfortable and i have a bad back.,4
"I went out to meet a friend at Bomberos wine bar on Wednesday night and arrived around 6pm to a half empty patio. I love this patio; it is cozy, inviting and bigger than the actual restaurant. With the great weather we are having, patio season is in full effect and the patio at Bomberos can be the blue print for any entertaining hosts backyard. The large lush mesquite trees that hang over most of the patio doubles as a ceiling with specs of sparkling light from the stars gleaming between the branches, the overly comfy couches are inviting and soft and make conversing more comfortable. Dark grays and the dim light from the candles on the table set the mood for a relaxing evening. The centerpiece of the patio is a gas fire pit that accentuates both the trees and the faces of the other patrons seated at the other tables.\n\nOk so if I were only rating the patio, Bomberos would get 5 stars no problem. The menu is small and reminiscent of a fine tapas restaurant. Deemed to be South American, the only thing South American on the menu is the wine and a reference to a chimichurri sauce. I ordered the three-cheese plate and a glass of carmenere from Argentina and I can't remember what wine my companion had but she ordered the bruschetta combo. The cheeses were nothing special unless Bomberos has a special cutting technique I was just satisfied. The three bruschetta were large and gorgeous but lacking flavor. I remember the feeling that something was missing. The waitress was friendly and attentive, checking in on us every 10 minutes. If you are expecting more food out of Bomberos or if it is described to you as a South American Restaurant head to Havana Caf\u00e9 or Mi Cocina. If you want to have great conversation over some amazing wine, Bomberos patio is one of the best in the valley.\n.",2
"Imagine a craft cocktail bar with the laid back ambiance of a local watering hole. I was so delighted with this bar that I went twice in one day.  I think it was the \""no-frills-come-as-you-are\"" attitude that made me fall in love with this place. The spectacular cocktails also helped! If you are ever in Montreal, please make Le Lab a priority!  I wish Boston had a place like this. We do have a lot of speak-easy, craft cocktail places, but nothing as laid back as Le Lab.",4
After coming here a few times I think their pricing is off. My friend got a red tip with red sparkle that shouldn't cost more than full colored nails with one sparkle nail. I also had a sparkle accent nail and when I asked for another layer of sparkle I wasn't told it would be $3 extra. Well that came out of her tip. It's a huge rip off to charge $3 for one coat! I did approach the owner who offered the extra back. Their 3D jewels are over priced by far. The pedicures could use a gentle touch I was dug into and hurt several times as was my friend. Over al my nails look fine but the sparkle still has holes even at an extra coat.,2
"I will NEVER eat there again as long as their tyrant general manager Todd is in charge. His treatment of the servers was hard to watch. He is a bully and he frankly turned my stomach. I am going to write a well worded letter to the corporate, no one deserves that kind of treatment.",0
"US Airways is a rip off. Get this: bought a ticket, then couldn't use it because work came up. Cancelled the flight. They provided a voucher/credit for use w/in 12 months. \n\nTwo days later, found a new flight for a week & 1/2 later. Called to use the voucher and was told there would be $150 change fee on top of the NEW much lower airfare. Hmmm...\n\nAfter multiple discussions with various agents, was told that tho' there was a ticket for $175 less than the voucher, which I was looking at online at the moment, and I wanted to use the voucher for the amount PLUS the ridiculous change fee, which would leave me still paying another $25 (remember, I already paid $250 for the ticket I had to cancel), I was not allowed! Period. No discussion. Too bad. \n\nWHY? Because the actual ticket price had to be equal to or more than the original ticket, plus pay the change fee. EVIL",0
Fast Chinese food and you get a lot for your money! \n\nFood is good. \n\nBut their pot stickers scared me way to big and texture was not on point!,2
"The food was okay and what you would expect from a hotel restaurant, but everything was ridiculously overpriced ($5 for a grapefruit, $3 for tea that is identical to the free tea in your guest room). I could get over the prices, however, if it weren't for the terrible service.\n\nThe hostess was unfriendly, unsmiling, and unhelpful. Our server was slow, rude, unhelpful, and unenthusiastic. It seemed other tables were experiencing the same poor service. I would never return.",1
The place is pretty empty the sushi is just ok. I like my sushi traditional and good  and not lots of thinks on,1
"I used to frequent this shopping area quite a bit and even set foot in this store when it first opened. It had been busy and I was overwhelmed by the number of people that showed up. I left, vowing I'd come back.\n\nPrior to that my experience with Philosophy had only been in department stores like Nordstrom and Sephora.\n\nI have visited a total of four times and each time, there was such a level of unfriendliness that I encountered, it turned me off the brand completely. I know it sounds petty, but I was never greeted in any of the times I set foot in that establishment. However, the people that came in after me were greeted. When I had questions, I had been rebuffed twice and once I had one of the girls walk to the back and not come out until (it seemed like) I had gone.\n\nOn my last and final visit, I came in and was browsing. No greeting...however, when my husband came in, he was greeted. (he had been to the barnes & noble next door)\n\nIn the end, I purchased some Philosophy's Hope In A Jar from Sephora...and that product had such an unpleasant smell...It reinforced my visits to their physical store front - unpleasant.\n\nI'm done with Philosophy for good. I know I should never have deviated from my Eminence or Clarins love. Philosophy taught me to stick to the lines that I know and benefit from.",1
"Such a shame this place has such terrible service because the atmosphere and happy hour is great! Have rented a karaoke room, came for lunch and did happy hour... Every time horrible service! Long waits for food and drinks, servers and bartenders have poor attitudes... Pretty sure we won't be back",1
I used to frequent and love this place ! But you took away the menu with pics and customers are confused and now the line to order is long because customers have to ask do many questions! Add pics to the menu board you dummies.,0
"so the only reason i end up going to the cafe bellagio is because of the daym creme brule..... other than than this place isnt that great. \n\nmaybe cuz they are part of bellagio, the people there dont give a crap about service... o they dooooo care about how the table looks. apparently, the salt sits beside the sugar... the lady told the waiter \""white on white\"" to remember that cuz they want everything uniform for their customers... shit how about SERVICE.... service here FUCKING SUCKS A BIG FAT CACK.... i wanted to go around messing with all the salt and pepper shakers to just mess with them. \n\nthere USED to be this omlette with crab/asparagus/boursin cheese... well NOT any more.. they replaced the boursin cheese with mozzerella... NOT THE SAME... and the new omlette is SOOO NOT worth the $13... i tried the thai lettuce wraps... which was ok, but because i didnt technically order lunch, i was denied bread cuz it is only served with lunch... i wanted to scream my heart out... i freaking waited 10 min for the waitress' fat ass to take my order and now i gotta wait for my food and i am starving.. great... \n\ngood news is, theres no smoking in the hotel/restaurants any more! yay to nevada residents who wanna keep their lungs for the next 50 years... to the addictive personalities, dont worry, you can smoke your lungs out in the casino where smoking will forever be permitted....",0
"Tres bien!\n\nAt first I was afraid we'd made the wrong choice for dinner----the menu didn't feature an obvious vegetarian option other than a garden salad. But, after asking our [stellar] server if this was going to be a problem, he assured of us it was not. I was given chef-created, vegan options based on my veg likes and dislikes, and it was the best meal I had in Montr\u00e9al the weekend I was there.",3
"Great food and great service. Happy Hour is everyday with 50% off on most menu items. Our server, was phenomenal from the beginning and recommended the perfect wine to go with our meal. They are starting to feature live music but the volume doesn't over power the ambiance of the place.\n\nWe ordered the calamari...one of the best I've had in the valley. It didn't have your typical marinara sauce, but instead was tossed with slivers of banana peppers and an aoli sauce...excellent. For the main course we had the sirloin (they recommended the rib-eye but had ran out by then) and the fettucini \""crabonara\"". We didn't feel rushed and the food came out perfect.\n\nDefinitely coming back here again to try everything else. Their menu items weren't your typical italian fair and they served probition era type drinks and cocktails which were interesting...it also helped they were 50% off.",3
If you decided to try this place. You need to make sure that you are not very hungry and they don't have more than 3 tables of customers. This place is really slow on the service and with a lot of pickup/delivery orders. The food is so so consider that you are in Montreal and you can not compare the quality of Japanese food here with other bigger cities like Toronto or Vancouver. The buffet menu is big but the average wait time is way too long. There were couple of complains about the wait during my visit and couple of complains from the phone about the never arrive deliveries. I personally won't come back again when there are 2 other better sushi buffet in town.,2
"I was REALLY looking forward to reviewing Chippendales.  But here I am, reluctantly reviewing Sapphire for a bachelorette party I attended last weekend.  And boys...I am here only to review the Men of Sapphire. \n\nSapphire claims to be the \""largest\"" gentlemen club in Vegas.  So woohoo for them!?  It is located off the strip, though not far, as the ride to Sapphire was more around 10 minutes.  The girls and I were told that Sapphire offers complimentary limo ride from your hotel to the joint. What a big misconception.  A small Shuttle bus comes to the hotel around 9:15pm showed up instead.  It was nothing glamorous, definitely wasn't impressed.  And then I was told that everyone is required to tip the driver $3.  A taxi ride to share among the girls would most likely end up being the same.  And yes, that made me grumpy because I wanted to go to Chippendales, dang it!  \n\nSo then the 15 of us were escorted to the admission line, where we each shelled out $40 for the Men of Sapphire.  We had to wait in the main bar area because the show didn't start until 10pm.  So I waited and diverted my attention to the girls dancing on stage, thinking \""wow, must hurt to be able to bend like that.  But eh, you ain't got anything I don't have!\""\n\nI would definitely suggest getting there early because you get seated more in the front, \""closer to the actions\"" so to speak.  Briefly after getting seated, the bartender wasted no time going around taking orders.  I had a midori sour, which cost me $11.  Oh, and we were also treated with a free round of shot, as part of the $40.  I don't know what it was...but it tasted more like grapefruit juice to me than alcohol.  \n\nThe show starts promptly, and it was one cheesy-ness after another.  The guys come out dressed as a doctor, firefighter, cop, and other ones I can't remember.  The best/funniest part was the Asian guy dancing/singing to Justin Timberlake's d!ck in a box.  It was pretty lame, but hilarious!  They also call girls up on stage to give lap dances to, which were paid for ($20?) before the show starts.   \n\nOverall, this place really wasn't as bad as I had expected.  We left around midnight, and boy was that place quiet already!  And they must be hurting for money too.  All I see were the men talking to girls and taking them to the back to do who knows what!  That's what I'd like to know. So ladies, if you're looking for some clean fun, Sapphire is a bit lame, but entertainment factor is there!  I've also been told that Chippendales and Thunder Down Under attract more of an older crowd, not the case here.              \n\ni had an okay time, but definitely don't wanna revisit.",2
"Great food, awesome selections!",3
"It all started for me with this simple, sweet, innocent truck ... It was late one night and craving a good burger. What I found was a gourmet style burger, towered with onion straws and sweet potato fries . I was very satisfied.\n\nAs days went on, I questioned myself as to, really, I am driving around and speaking so highly of a food truck -  -  -  yes, I was and still am, especially now the the owner Doug is the Chef again.  Yes, I did say Chef, not cook - Doug has a lot of experiences in the culinary world.",3
"We came to Vegas for a friend's birthday celebration and chose Morels for her surprise birthday dinner.  All i can say is that I was really disappointed and ended up feeling a little sick for the rest of the night.  We called in advance to see if they could do something special for her birthday (like a dessert, etc. that said Happy Birthday) and they immediately told us that they didn't comp any desserts but that they could do something on a dessert we chose (which we agreed to).  \n\nThe service was a worse than what I had expected and the food was definitely worse than expected.  3 of us ordered the salmon and my other friend and I ordered the short rib.  I heard the salmon was a little undercooked and underwhelming.  The short rib was a huge disappointment - it was very dry and while it was tender, it didn't really go down very well.  I even had to ask for more sauce in hopes of ameliorating the situation, but the sauce didn't help that much.  The mac and cheese was delicious - maybe the best part of my meal.\n\nWe ordered two desserts to share all around and we even went to remind our waiter to do write happy birthday on at least one of the desserts and we were assured that they were taking care of it.  The two desserts came and none of them had any writing on it.  Then after we were eating for 5 minutes, a third dessert came out with a candle.  It was a pistachio souffle and we were all surprised at how nice it looked.  Until the bill came and they ended up charging us for it even though we didn't order it.\n\nThe bill ended up coming out late and after we wrote clear instructions on how to split the bill four ways, there was a lot of confusion and it was clear that they ran our cards a couple of times before figuring out exactly how to charge a specific amount.\n\nAll in all, I was really disappointed with the service and the quality of food -- definitely wouldn't come back here.",0
"Yes it's hard to get a reservation and yes it's cramped, but the euphoria of flavors in their exquisite, unique cuisine is worth it.  We had lamb chops that were impossibly melt in the mouth tender paired with a great red from our own cellar.  Couldn't be better!!!",4
"Went there with my wife after reading very positive reviews in the Internet and the local news paper.  May be our expectations were too high, but after tasting their food, we were kinda disappointed.  The decor and the service remind us a fast-food stand.  The meat was dry and way too smoky that stacked in our mouths for long hours after.  I understand that for some people  this is the ultimate BBQ taste, but not for us.",0
"If you're vegan, you can eat here!\n\nThe vegetable spring rolls and general tao tofu is vegan! And the tofu is fantastic! They fry it till its SUPER crispy and its so delicious!\n\nLocation:\nRight in the gay village. In the summer, the patio is open on the street (as the street is completely closed off from any cars). The inside is nice and simple. The bathrooms are clean.\n\nI'm giving this a 4 star only because I feel like $10 for the general tao tofu is a little much. I wouldn't mind paying max $8 since its not a HUGE portion or anything.\n\nBut, other than that, I recommend.",3
"Nothing special, move along",2
"So I went here last friday with a group of coworkers.  My ratingL is meh for the food. There is goods and bad's, but all in all it isn't worth returning.  Let me start off by saying the restaurant is very clean and the wait staff was super friendly.  Our waitress was great.  So onto the food.  I had a lunch special.  Beef Taco, Red Cheese enchilada and beans.  I really dislike when places use manufactured taco shells that seem like the ones you can buy at a grocery store.  They taste like cardboard.  Stop using them!  If Fillyberto's can make theirs on the spot, so can you.  The enchilada sauce also tasted like the stuff you get in the can or in grade school lunches.  Wasn't a fan.  The salsa were good and so were the beans. But the taco and enchilada, two basic things, were just meh.  Sorry guys, won't return.",1
"I've been now twice to Republic Ramen + Noodles for lunch and the first time was good but the second was much better! The first visit the friendly guy at the counter went thru the menu and I asked what his favorite was and it was the Tonkotsu and so I got that and had beef and chicken. The bowls are VERY large so I was shocked (even though they do have a bowl at the register to show you it looks very different full). Since it was so large he package the rest up for me to go. I also had a very yummy Boba on that visit as well.\n\nThe second visit I had the Republic Ramen which was spicy but VERY good. I opted not to get any meat in the noodles this trip as all bowls include Spinach, Sprouts, Scallions, Red Pepper and Carrots that was all I really wanted. This was so good I didn't have any left overs to take with me. \n\nI will for sure go back and try a few other dishes and more Boba drinks!\n\nThe decor is very simple and clean so that is another plus in my book!",3
"I've been to this location a couple of times with an OK experience, but tonight we arrived 3 minutes before closing and the clerk had already turned off the open sign and locked the door.  We tried to walk up to see if he would change his mind but he wouldn't even look up for at least a minute, endlessly staring at the floor or at the walls in an attempt to avoid eye contact...low class move.  I would have minded less had he simply acknowledged us and said \""sorry we're closed\"".  It was almost closing time - I understand wanting to go home - but regardless it's not the way to treat customers.\n\nI have contacted what I presume is Smoothie King management (Greg) about this as well.",1
"Had a meal here yesterday afternoon about 3:30-ish with my daughter as we had $10-off coupons for lunch entrees.  I have to agree with another reviewer, the prices are truly out of line.  $14.95 for a lunch entree is ridiculous.  I had the blackened tilapia with the side of seasonal vegetables and, while the fish was just luscious, the veggies could have used some more time in the steamer, particularly the carrots.  When will the chefs learn that carrots take longer to cook than zucchini?\n\nSince I was driving, I avoided alcohol and ordered a cranberry juice and soda with lime.  The first one came in a tall glass with the lime on the lip so I could squeeze it if I wishes.  When I asked for a refill, the bartender chose that time to take a break, so the other waitress (not ours) went behind the bar to prepare another one, which she put into a wine  glass and squeezed the lime herself.  Consistency, thy name is NOT Brio Tuscan Grille.  \n\nMy daughter had the Mediterranean Shrimp and said it was very good - I had a small bite of shrimp and it was quite spicy/bitey, but good.  She said that she has eaten at this location several times and has never had a bad meal -  I'll take her word for it. \n\nThe food was good, I think I would rather have sat at a table than at a high-top in the bar, as we were witness to a couple of not-so-nice remarks from one waitress to the other.  I think they need a lesson in how to behave around customers.\n\nSince I don't live in this area. I probably won't be back.  If I lived here, I probably wouldn't be back anyway.\n\nAND I STILL WANT TO KNOW WHY EVERY DAMNED RESTAURANT WITH A BAR AREA TRIES TO BE A SPORTS BAR!!!!!!  Turn off the televisions and let the music play.",2
This place was call Yu's when it opened. If you want to read the reviews look them up. I believe this place sold a year ago as there was new people at that time. The menu has not changed and the food seems to still be prepared fresh and with quality ingredients. One order will feed two people easy. We usually just get one meal and split it unless we want something in the refrigerator to eat during the week.The lady that is behind the  counter is super nice and helpful. We eat there a couple times a month and when people are in town we always take them there once during their stay. This is a local owned business and they do a great job. If you are in for Chinese give them a try.,3
"I'll be honest, I did not have high expectations for Sol Azteca.  From the uninspiring storefront to its handwritten fusion menu featuring Asian and Mexican cuisine, this restaurant raised more red flags than a Soviet-era May Day parade.  However, I cast those apprehensions aside and ended up getting a pretty solid lunch during my recent visit.\n\nIf you ascribe to the philosophy for Mexican food joints that the sketchier the restaurant, the better the chow, then Sol Azteca is a must visit.  The restaurant, across from the abandoned Thorstad auto dealership on Park Street and sharing a space with the South Park Coin Laundry, is easy to miss.  Cautiously stepping through the door, I was greeted by an empty, dimly lit restaurant to could have served as the set for the straight to video budget sequel of From Dusk to Dawn - not an auspicious start.\n\nI grabbed a table in the back and the restaurant's cleanliness impressed me.  While the ramshackle building showed its age in places (tears in the faux leather booths and numerous scratches on the tabletops), the tabletops and floors were remarkably clean.  I also was pleasantly surprised to see the restaurant had free wi-fi for customers (password protected).  Once I settled in, my server provided me with a menu.  It was the first time I ever witnessed teriyaki chicken and tripe tacos sharing menu space - I can check that off my bucket list.  With over 10 different taco filling options to chose from, there are plenty of choices for both adventurous and cautious eaters. \n\nMy soft-spoken server did not speak great English and I continue to curse my decision to take high school German instead of Spanish, so I appreciated that my server pointed to each of my choices (pollo, pastor and barbacoa tacos) to confirm my order.  Despite the language barrier, my server did a great job during my stay at Sol Azteca.  \n\nWithin five minutes of making my order, my food arrived, which was a good thing, because Sol Azteca does not offer a complimentary basket of chips and salsa.  Overall, the plate looked appetizing.  Sprinkled with the traditional toppings of diced onions and cilantro, I noticed all three tacos had generous portions of the meat fillings.   At first, I thought the cook also topped my tacos with chives, but upon closer examination, I realized it was the woody end of the cilantro stems.\n\nThe cook did a tremendous job preparing each of the fillings - I encountered no unpleasant textures in any of the three tacos.  The tortillas were fresh and provided great corn flavor.  On the other hand, all three fillings needed a little more seasoning to amp up the flavor.  Next time I will ask to for hot sauce to fill that void.\n\nI enjoyed the pastor taco the most - great porky flavor complemented by saut\u00e9ed onions and juicy pineapple.  The kitchen also nailed the texture by including some crispy pieces to go with the rest of the fork-tender shredded meat.  \n\nThe pollo also was solid, packed with a serious helping of tender, shredded white meat.  While the tomato base offered some flavor, the chicken really needed more seasoning to provide some much needed zip.  \n\nThe barbacoa was the last taco I tried and it had cooled by the time I got to it, which contributed to its overall dry, chewy texture.  Like the chicken, this shredded beef practically begged for some additional seasoning to punch up the flavor.\n\nA side of rice and beans accompanied my taco platter ($7.99).  While I enjoyed the rice, the beans looked pureed and needed a serious dose of salt.   \n\nWhile Sol Azteca had its quirks, overall I found my lunch satisfying and would have no qualms returning.  I'd give it a solid 3.5 rating, but since Yelp digs whole numbers, I'm going with three stars until I can sample more items from their extensive menu.",2
"Whenever I've taken a trip down Leith Walk, I always feel on edge. There has never been a time that I've walked down hassle free or without someone asking me for spare change. Just the other week I was stopped no less than 3 times before I was a quarter of the way down and one of the men asking me for money got rather aggressive when I said no and followed me for a few metres until someone else came along. Leith Walk reminds me of Victoria Street in Glasgow, somewhere that I'd never walk along on my own.\n\nNo matter what time of day you find yourself here, there's always an abundance of drunken men spilling out of the bookies and pubs than line the street.\n\nThere is a good mix and selection of shops and many independent stores too which is refreshing but the seedy undertone to Leith Walk puts me of going anywhere near it and although you'd probably never come to any harm here, I'd still recommend walking here with a friend, especially at night!",1
"Went here today for a surprise ice cream date with my bf. He got out of work really early and was needing some sugar. I had been raving about this place and suggested it instead of the usual Dairy Queen or Mr. D's. \n\nAs usual we walk in and the lovely young man describes their concept for my man. He is down for the Apple A La Mode crepe and I branched out and got the East Meets West crepe. Both were good. I must admit that his was better. Mine wasn't bad but the consistency kinda weirded me out (they did the crepe right...I just had a different thought in my head when I ordered it). So I definitely won't be getting that one again but the service, quality of ingredients and overall value still rock. The only reason its getting 4 stars is because I wasn't blown away by my crepe but I will definitely be back again soon. I must start working my way down the menu.",3
This is a great branch and location but there are always a ton of screaming kids there. I miss the days when librarians would shush people.,3
"It is difficult to rank a Hotel/Casino like Bellagio, because there's so much that comes with it. It's not just the hotel or casino, but restaurants, attractions, service, and upkeep.\n\nRooms\nThe best hotel in Las Vegas to me is the Wynn. I've stayed at the larger suites in BOTH (Salon @ the Encore and Presidential @ Bellagio) and you can tell the difference by seeing the attention to the details. Little things such as TVs (huge flatscreens), bathrooms, layout, artwork, and decor are better at the Wynn. The biggest thing I notice is the upkeep. Bellagio rooms need a makeover to keep their elite status in my opinion. Carpet, fridge, TVs, and bathrooms were all underwhelming. When you go into a Bellagio class Suite, everything should be something you can't get at home. If your TV at home is bigger, then you're not going to be impressed. I think Bellagio is right there with hotels like The Cosmopolitan. This is just my opinion, but The Cosmo is only nice because it's new. Their rooms are very modern, but don't necessarily convey luxury in every aspect. I like it, but both seem a little less amazing than the Wynn -- close to great. Also this was for the larger suites. Some of the regular rooms have seen some modest upgrades.\n\nService\nBoth are quite top notch. I haven't had an issue with either.\n\nRestaurants and Attractions\nhighly debatable. It really depends what you want. If you want to club, then Wynn has XS. Buffets are good at both. Wynn has some stuff Bellagio doesn't but Bellagio's is one of the most consistent and solid buffets in Vegas. The nicer restaurants. Honestly I haven't been to most of them. I do know that from the people I've talked to the overall impression and consensus seems to be that the Wynn has more wow factor. The food itself is good at both. Next time at the Wynn, I plan to hit up Sinatra.\n\nGambling\nBoth are catered more to higher end gamblers. I mainly play poker, so it depends what you're looking for. Both casinos are made to gamble and they are not like the Cosmopolitan where it is more of an afterthought. Bellagio has been stepping it up with more tournaments and high roller rooms and separate room for celebrity status players. I recently saw Doyle, Gus Hansen, and a bunch of others just chillin at the Bellagio. I prefer the Bellagio poker room, because it's more comfortable. The Wynn's buy-in is higher and the competition is more stuffy (which can be good or bad).\n\nFor me personally, Bellagio is old money. I recently got upgraded to the MLife Pearl status which apparently gets you to the front of the line at the Buffet. Saving at least an hour will definitely warrant a return. Also staying anywhere near City Center (Vdara, Aria, Mandarin, Cosmo), Bellagio is the best place to play so I see our relationship continuing to flourish. The Wynn's main issue is that it is further north, so can't really walk to and fro. Yes, I said to and fro.

"A group of my friends came here between 12 and 1pm, as one of several stops for a bachelor party. We quickly found our way to the bar where we received excellent service from the impressive bartender Victoria (5 stars). She provided some solid suggestions for our evening plans and was a delight. I gave whiskey river 4 stars since nothing here really impresses me but simultaneously nothing disappoints. Stop in for a beer and stay a while if it is for you. Didn't try the food but it looked good.",3
"Disappointed I didn't go to a true dim sum restaurant on Spring Mountain.  Like other Yelpers I thought I'd give this new place a shot. I was first excited about a dim sum place close to our Vegas house but then I was let down when I saw the menu. Their name \""Dim Sum Cafe\"" implies that they know what dim sum is...but this place has little idea what they are doing.  The serving staff is predominantly non-Asian and had no clue what cheong fun noodles and traditional dim sum fare are.  I explained what I was looking for \""beef cheong fun\"" and the server said they have it. When the dish arrived it was beef noodle stir fry- not even close to the flat rice noodle filled with beef, pork, or shrimp.  I ordered 2 and those plates never touched my table- I sent them back as soon as I saw them. It's like I went to a so-called hamburger stand and they had no clue what a cheeseburger is. Gawd. It took a while for them to figure out we need plates and I guess they didn't have chopsticks ready.  \n\n$4.25 eggroll (2 pieces): you think it would be good or large for the money, right? Wrong. It seemed like they just fried some eggrolls from Ranch 99 and charged $2 a piece. Super rip-off because the eggroll was not very tasty. Adding insult to injury my kid ordered a grilled cheese sandwich and they didn't have cheddar cheese so she got a grilled mozerella sandwich. Yuck. \n\nConfused menu: small dim sum collection, American breakfast of oatmeal, waffles, french toast. Salads, spaghetti, and fish. \n\nWait staff was slow to figure out we needed place settings and our server acknowledged that they were having many customers complaining about the menu. Restaurant was clean (it's 2 weeks new) and the TVs on the wall still had the Energy Consumption sticker on them. No fish in the tanks yet, either. \n\nI hope these reviews serve as a wake-up call to the owners. Vegas is not the kind of place that supports or tolerates a bad restaurant- especially one that leaves customers feeling tricked and overcharged. I would love to pay good money for good food, but this place is like its indoor wooden trellis: the structure is there but it isn't polished and leaves people asking the question \""Why?!\""  I'd skip this place until they get many of the wrinkles ironed out.  Hopefully they do it soon before the Grand Opening turns into the Grand Closing.",0
"Worst Chinese restaurant I've ever ate at feathers in the fried chicken and red meat egg fu young was more like egg fu cakes shrimp cakes were saturated in water. Only Chinese restaurant ive went to who does not have duck sauce. Cocktail sause was ketchup with chunks of something general toso was tasteless and soggy beff and broccoli was just broccoli. Also the shrimp crab legs were dried up and hard sweet and sour sauce was just red water minimal entr\u00e9e selections waiter refilled one persons drink. I had to get up amd ask for a refill, appeared the cook just threw a bunch of stuff together and labeled it as Chinese food. The worst $22.66 ive ever spent on Chinese food for lunch in my life.",0
"Dear Pizza Hut,  your dough is just horrible please take a page from Dominos and scrap what you're doing and get back in the game.   Tonight's pizza was just a mess.   Half went to the trash.   And that's only because we were so disgusted that we shared it with a less discriminating friend.  I can't believe I actually like this stuff as a kid.   Was it always this bad?  I'd like to think not,  but seriously, just stop it...jokes over.   I'm giving 2-stars only because the employees seemed to be on point and I had no issue there.",1
"Like the old saying goes, you can put lipstick on a pig, but in the end you are still making out with a pig! Since the last time I was here at this food court at the convention center they slapped a coat of paint on the place and redecorated a bit. Renamed it \""Aces\"". Woo-Hoo! How appropriate for Vegas. Too bad the food comes up far from aces.\n\nThe problem is that you are still being served up mediocre food offerings at a high price point for convention center slop. Think bland burgers, rubbery grilled chicken, fake Asian food, and greasy pizza. At least there is a salad option here but that is about it, along with some pre-packaged stuff to grab and run.\n\nThe one thing that didn't change are the long ass lines that makes you want to kill someone when trying to get a bite to eat here during lunch hours. At least there are a lot of tables here so when it's crowded you can do the hover and grab a seat when someone moves.\n\nGod, I really hate convention center food.",1
"This Walmart is the Worst i have ever seen, They have at least 50 registers and only 3 or 4 are ever open if you're lucky. It feels  like  you're walking around the state fair trying to find what  you need. They have the worst selection of produce, meats, and employees. No one is ever by the deli section. If i didnt live so damn close i wouldnt come back to this store, Everything about it sucks. And dont even think about trying to return anything, OMG The Line...The Line",0
"With so many positive reviews already, I can just reconfirm what's already been said: great food, really delicious, cozy atmosphere (like somebody's house... because essentially it is).  \nI had the larp, and the greens were fresh and delicious.  \nI think the best dish in our group was the chicken curry - amazing flavor!\nThe staff was very helpful, if understaffed, for lunch. \nDefinitely recommended.  Park on one of the side streets nearby.  There's a bakery and a coffee shop within walking distance, but the bakery was closed the day we were there.",3
"We're there on Sunday.  The food and service were horrible.\nEspecially the hostesses were so rude.  To me they should not be in service at all.\nFlatware, dishes, and utensils are all dirty.\nThey served wine in dirty glasses with lipstick \nOn them. And when they were asked to bring\na replacement glasses, they really gave us the attitude.\nI'd not come back to this place anymore, and \nWould not recommend anyone to come unless\nYou want to get the same service that I got!",0
"Horrible service!\n\nMy friends and I (party of 6) arrived at 7:00 and were told it would be a 30 to 35 minute wait.  At 7:50 we were finally seated.  \n\nNext, my friends ordered sushi and I ordered a chicken salad. Big mistake.  All of the sushi came out at different times, and finally at 8:25 I asked where my salad was. 8:35 the server comes back and says they accidentally cooked it with dark meat and asked if I still wanted it with white meat, to which I replied yes, I wanted it with white meat. (My friends were done eating at that point.) He then unapologetically stated that will be another 10-15 minutes.  \n\n8:50 he brings out the salad and I ask for a fork. 8:55 he comes back with cheater chopsticks and tells me they are all out of forks.\n\nI mean REALLY?!?\n\nLong story short, my friend stood up for me and told them to comp my salad, which they did, but the manager never came out to apologize.  \n\nAnd no, I did not eat my salad with chopsticks; I took it home to eat instead.  Good food.  It's a shame they have such lousy service.",0
"I just love this place. Food is amazing. Chicken souvlaki, kefte, salads, even plain old butter lemon rice is AMAZING. Probably The Best chicken souvlaki I've had in Vegas -- and I'm born and raised in southeastern Europe, I'm very picky about my Balkan foods. So good. Check it out. Their Major downfall -- terribly slow service. Plan on waiting for like 20-30 min on your one dish to come out. Worth it though.",4
0 stars.  Too many choice out there to receive bad service while paying to do business.,0
"Service was pretty good nothing spectacular but the server was nice.\nHovever, this place had possibly one of the worst chinese food I've been to.\nHot n sour soup tasted like vinegar... I have had a lot of hot n sour soup in my life but never tasted anything like this...\nString beens were too grown didn't have the right texture nor was is spiced right.\nKung pao shrimp had a pretty good sauce but the shrimps were most likely frozen nd old.\nMao po tofu was ok\nMaybe Americanized chinese menus are ok... but the morr authentic menus were pretty bad...\nI've eaten a lot of Chinese food around the world and this might be one of the memorable ones in terms of bad taste.\nThe Kung Pao shrimp and string beens could have been better with better ingredients, but that hot n sour was a big no no",0
"There are both positives and negatives with this airport. I like that I've never had to come here super early before a flight because the lines are never super long. There are many food options and there is free internet. But I don't like that the walk from the gates to baggage claim is super long and that there aren't enough charging stations or outlets throughout the place, but coming here is fun because of all the lights and slot machines make me excited for VEGAS!",2
"I like this adidas store because unlike the Chicago store they always have my favorite shoe in stock, the ZX700, and they have flat laces that I can't find anywhere else called \""skater laces\"" not hip hop thick but not as thin as the stock laces.",3
"Went for the beers, stayed for the Bavarian pretzel with warm beer cheese. You should to.",3
Tidy place with nice decor. I ordered guey jub (roll rice noodle soup with porks) and it was so tasty. It is hard to find this dish being away from thailand but they do cooked it to perfection here. The owners and waitress are very nice too:),4
"So So good, you get good bang for your buck,... skip the paradise bakery and head here love it!! They also have Italian soda which is also so so so good.",4
"Really good food, service was okay. A little on the pricey side, and as good as the good is, I'm not sure it's worth the food to price ratio. Worth experiencing a few times, a good change from the norm aswell but that's about it.",2
"I had my first taste of Firehouse Subs today and decided to go with the Beef & Cheddar eight inch sandwich with a large Diet Dr. Pepper from their fabulous soda machine. That machine kind of reminds me of Rodney Dangerfield's character in the Caddyshack where he had that golf bag that played music, so versatile just like the soda machine delivering many different types of sodas. http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W3A9rLoz_0o\n\nThe Beef and Cheddar sandwich comes with bbq sauce and mayo. I got it without the mayo and it tasted fabulous. The only problem was that I felt a little hungry after eating it. So there's the rub, an excellent tasting meal with just a little bit of meat. Five stars for taste but one star for not putting out my 5 alarm hunger pangs.",2
"This reminds me of the song Inner City Blues and Donny Hathaway's \""In the Ghetto\""\n\nTwo BEAUTIFUL songs, and I conjure them to cope with how incredibly disgustingly awful this place is.  Dingy is a good word.  It is like an endless universe of cigarette smoke stumbled into this place to destroy any hope you could have with dealing with this place.\n\nCoyote Ugly?  Are you kidding?  The casino is weird, the dinner is sooooo bunk, I am sure the buffet was okay but I was running out with my finger ramming into my temple in panicked irrationality.\n\nI wouldn't even go inside later to get to the tram quicker.  Please.... don't make me go to white trash disneyland strip mall again.  Please.\n\nOh yeah... Dick's Last Resort?  funny... you can get \""crabs\""  hahaha... but it kills the awful theme, you know?",1
"Only average tasting, at best. I ordered a 50 dollar tomahawk steak, which says 24oz, but at least 20oz of it is the bone. It was medium cooked yet the outside is burnt. I would give it a lower rating but their mac n cheese is pretty damn good. My friend had the sirloin which was not bad. Brand you guys need to step it up, maybe I expected too much? Also noticed particles in the glass of grey goose we ordered... sigh. 150$ meal.....",2
"Located inside the hip Hard Rock Hotel (HRH) and next to the oh so famous Mr. Lucky is this new joint call Culinary Dropout. New to Vegas and ready to be discovered. By the name, I am assuming it's a bunch of great chefs getting together to build a culinary creation without the political bs. Let's get cooking has to be their motto.\n\nWhy am I so excited about this? Because when we first arrived, there's a line to get in! This has to be a good sign. I'm always stoked to support local chefs with creative minds and energy. It's probably the best kind of food when chefs are able to do what they want and how. The food always seem to speak to you. We have a show to catch and we decided to opt for the bar. Sitting at the bar at any restaurant had proven to be the fastest, or so we thought. This was the beginning to many mistakes to come.\n\nAs we sat there, I noticed how awesome the inside of this restaurant is. Patio seating, bar seating, open kitchen and so laid back. I'm more excited at this point that I don't realized time is kind of flying by. The staff is dressed in fun outfits to express their own unique styles. It's cool, until you need help and can't differentiate who is who. Manger? nonexistence. We sat by the bar in the lounge area and at no point did I see anyone that acted or even resembled a manager. I get that this place wants to play outside the school yard but there really should be a managerial presence for the guests. \n\nAfter placing our orders, its time to kick back and enjoy the night. Here's what's on our menu for tonight.\n\n1st course: Shrimp cocktail and french onion soup.\nYou can't go wrong with the shrimp cocktail as an appetizer. We saw them on the way in. These big pink shrimp, more like prawns, were delicious. Really clean flavor and simple, served with mayo and cocktail sauce. Soup? Ha! I never got to try it because it came after my entree, in which I sent back. Not to be a brat but who serves soup after the entrees have arrived? Really?\n\n\n2nd course: Turkey pastrami and fried chicken\nI was told to try these two items and both were good. The turkey pastrami was served on pretzel bread, which seem a little staled and too salty. The overall dish was just okay. It read better than it actually was. It was a cheat day for me and I had to try the fried chicken. When it came out, it was mouth watering. It was golden brown and piping hot. My kind of chicken. This dish was actually pretty good. The batter was again a little too salty but the overall concept was great. Crispy and seasoned on the outside and moist chicken on the inside. It was served with mashed potatoes, corn biscuits and coleslaw. The mash potatoes were creamy and very suitable with fried chicken. Same with the biscuits. However, the coleslaw, someone please pull it off the menu. It was watery and over dressed with this vinegar taste. It was not appetizing whatsoever. \n\n3rd course: Brioche dessert. This course never happened for us because we barely had time to eat our main dishes.\n\nI can't express how disappointed I was with this place. Everything there was so unorganized. Our server was completely untrained. He had no idea on how to manage his time. Stop running to the back for one thing at a time. It took 20 MINUTES for shrimp cocktails and 35 MINUTES for soup to come. How is this possible? Both of these items are already prepared. Our server kept telling us he was going to check up on our food but as I looked around, people who came way after us has gotten their appetizers before us. Either he's lying or chef really hates him enough to mess up his food orders. \n\nIt wasn't just our server that was clueless. The \""food runners\"" were clueless too. We kept getting girls coming to our table and wanting to drop off appetizers. Do you not know where the tables are? Or can you not read? I don't know what is going on with this place but if they keep up their way of service, this place will definitely DROP OUT of the food scene. Get your gears together and organize. \n\nI probably won't be coming back to this place for another 3 or 4 months, assuming they'll still be there. I want to love this place because it is set up really well and the food was good and the atmosphere was super fun and young. I wish they would clean up and manage the staff better. Just because your place has the word dropout doesn't mean you need to hire dropouts.",1

"So I've never stayed at the hotel... but I am a fan of the free stuff here to do if you go to Vegas.\n\n1)  Catch the water/fountain show.  \n\n2)  Visit the garden inside the hotel.  \n\nBoth are beautiful and amazing.  On my most recent trip the fountain was synchronized to Christmas carols sung in Italian and the garden was all decked out for the holidays.  The fountain show is every 30 minutes (I think) and the garden is always open, but generally crowded if you go in the afternoon or evening with people taking pictures.\n\nThe Bellagio also has a chocolate fountain that will temp you into buying overpriced treats and is home to O, the amazing Cirque du Soleil show.",3
"Just got a pink box full of donuts! The decor is cute and sweet, you're welcomed by charming staff and sweet aroma of donuts...what more could you ask for?? \n\nWe got the $8.50 dozen of donuts! They had some crazy specialty donuts like the maple bar with bacon! There was bacon on top of the maple bar....that makes me nervous! But they only had 2 left, someone loves them!! \n\nMy only complain is when we got home I dove right into eating the raspberry filled donut...except they forgot the filling!!!!!! I was so upset but the donut was delish regardless so I wasn't mad for long! Just be careful Pink Box, I don't want that to happen to someone that is a stickler! \n\nOverall, great experience and can't wait to be back to try the Apple Fritter donut!",3
I can say that the New England clam chowder is some of the best I have had. I stop here to a from work. Roast beef and Philly sandwiches are large and filling. I have not have had the Lobster roll but I hear it insanely good. My next stop will include that review. Access to ECE is good. Staff is friendly. They also provided a drink while we waited. Big fan of that. You should try it. Not a big joint but cozy with great food.,3
"I hate this \""restaurant\"".  Steam table meats and rice stuffed into a store-bought tortilla?  Yum!!!  \n\nBtw, rice does not belong in a burrito.  Especially in this case since it is pure filler.  They use around 3 ounces of actual meat in their burritos I'm estimating.  Their salsas suck and the hot-sauces are canned and I hate the fake branding,  So twee and cool and hip and unoriginal and appealing... to teen-agers.  I have a teen-aged daughter.  She loves Chipotle.  I've noticed that the more she loves something the worse it is.  There you have it...\n\nThis place is fake and bad and pure filler.",0
Best place for breakfast all day and night.,2
"The food here is good quality, the place is nice, and the prices are affordable ($10 for lunch with tax and tip).  The hot & sour soup is one of the best I've ever had.  Beware that the hot food is HOT.  I will definitely go back here but order something more tame than the hot garlic sauce pork.\n\nService was a bit slow for lunch; it's more of a sit down type place than a eat and run restaurant.",3
"YOU DEFINITELY GET YOUR $$ WORTH \n\nI was researching my first Cirque Du Soleil show and wanted to get every pennies worth.  I was recommended by my fellow co-workers and they definitely told me to check out Ka, Zumanity, and Le Reve.  Decided to check out Ka as my first show out of the three.\n\nEmployee Discount. Check.! \n\nTip for thought: Best seats are in the Front! \n\nTickets in hand and the feeling of excitement just go through your head before entering the doors.  \n\nFirst thing you see is the Dragon statue and their photographers greeting you to take your picture.  Alas, I see the bar and decided to pick up some drinks to get turnt up and ready to enjoy! They have a good sized Ka Theatre cup that are great souvenirs.  Once you get in the actual theatre it just amazes you how spacious it is making your eyes wander all over the place\n\n The Show:\n\nGreat introduction and storyline that keeps wanting to know what happens every second\n\nThe Choreography is simply Extraordinary and its all the reviews say it is with combinations of dances, acrobatics, martial-arts with breathe taking stunts all on a stage that does it all which puts you on the edge of your seat.  You will notice the hours and hours of hard work each character puts in to the show.  \n\nAll in All, this is one of the best shows I've seen and can't wait to watch other Cirque Du Soleil shows.  So what are you waiting for? Surprise your significant other and go see this show.!",4

"I can't say that I am an expert on Indian foods, but I thought that aspects of this restaurant could have been better. The food was good but the service was poor. First of all, the waiters were sitting all of the people together by the windows on a rainy day. That would have been fine if the restaurant was full, but it wasn't. One group even had to asked to be sat somewhere else. We ordered our food and it was brought out in a timely manner. The food was tasteful, but nothing to call home about. The atmosphere of the restaurant was nice and the seats were roomy. When we got our check (there were two separate checks for four of us) they messed up who got what. It took three tries before they got it right. I would recommend trying it, as I would give it a second chance too.",2
"I left my card at Town Tavern Sunday night.  I've been calling every day to ask them if I can come by and get my card.  Today, about $2000+ in charges posted to my credit card account.  \n\nThere is a bar tender or waitress at this place who is either using my card or sold my card to someone.  I wouldn't go to this place, EVER.",0
"Went to Downtown Summerlin and was excited to try out this truck since I enjoy Mediterranean style food. As my friend and I were looking through the menu, the first impression I get from the young server is a rude complaint to the cook. Okay, whatever that's fine, I guess. As I am ordering my food, she is still busy complaint/fighting with the cook that she had me wait a bit for her to finish and get back to me. \n\nAs we get our order, our fries were the biggest disappointment. It was over cooked, drenched in oil and it was cold as if it has been sitting out long. It tasted and looked disgusting. When I spoke to a gentlemen that was working there about my fries, he looked annoyed and offended & also made a comment to me saying \""it's fries, it's cooked in oil\"" and when I looked at him with shock of the comment he had said, he tried to save himself by saying \""it's cooked in Mediterranean oil\"". Yeah...okay. After wanting a new batch of fries, he agreed and within mins I was given new fries. It was better but I've tasted better. \n\nOverall, I was disappointed with service and the lack of flavor.",0
Checked this place out for the first time last week and I wasn't overly wowed like I had hoped for. I really was expecting a little more that Lis Doon Varna but it was pretty much the same. I still like the back patio area and it is still a great place to grab a pint. The bar service was good and fast....never had a dry glass...Guess I was just hoping for a more lively scene this time around.,2
"I had heard great things and saw lots of 5 star yelps but I was not impressed. \n\nThe time we were there, there was either a hipster, wanna-be convention in town or there is a community college nearby. Well the people who work here certainly think they are cool. \n\nIt is open until 12Midnight and I would be curious what the crowd is like then. The floor is set up like a dining hall, not a bar (no real mingling space, long German style tables on a tightly packed floor) [might get rowdy in a good way]. The selection on draft beers was mildly impressive but they were out of the German Lager I wanted....but Guinness will do. The food was somewhat pricey and my dish, Veggie Rosemary Chicken, was bland. \n\nPeople seemed festive but I think I will try somewhere else next time.",1
"LOVE giving 5 star ratings and Roma is more than deserving. Boyfriend showed this place to me about 6 months months ago and I (scratch that, we) just can't stop. Chicken parm sandwich, every time.",4
"It's a bit disappointing when a restaurant (or a person, or a job, or a movie, for that matter) doesn't live up to its potential. This Firebirds has a lot going for them: decent sized menu, great location in SouthPark, pretty outdoor patio and nice, attentive service. But even with all of these seemingly nice features, the main component - the food - falls short. \n\nI enjoyed a lunch on the patio and while it's lovely, there isn't much of a view. Maybe I'm just too short, but all I saw were shrubs in my face. I ordered the fish tacos made with Mahi Mahi, served with roasted almond couscous. Sounded pretty damn tasty, and for $11 I went for it. \n\nWhile the couscous was generous in portion and toasted almond-y flavor, the fish tacos (the entire point of the meal) left a whole lot to be desired. For one, there were two tiny cubes of fish on each taco - I ate much more slaw than fish. But the main issue? The fish was incredibly salty...so salty I was downing my water and could hardly taste the flaky Mahi Mahi underneath. Sad fish. I ate the couscous instead. \n\nI think I'll head back to Firebirds for a cocktail at the bar...that seems to be more up my alley!",2
"Great Pedicure! First time trying this place out, getting out of work. Searched on yelp for a close by nail salon and found this. They don't talk at all. Especially my nail tech lady. Didn't even greet me, but I'm not a talker either. She gave me a relaxing massage on my feet, liked it. As soon as she finished polishing my nails she just walked away and didn't say a word. She was just not in the mood to talk to me I guess. Overall it's an alright place if you're near by and in need of a pedi after work like me. Probably won't visit this place again though.",2
"I am by no means any expert on Dim Sum... in fact, my first experience was at Great Wall! \nI enjoyed it so much, though, that I went back the next time I was in town. \nThey have a wide variety of dishes to choose from. And I must admit that it would be helpful to go with an experienced 'Dim-Sum-er' because some of the dishes can be intimidating!\nI don't eat any meat except fish, and they had plenty of delish options for me. The broccoli, noodle, tofu, and sesame balls are by far my favorites. \nThey can get really crowded, as both times I was there (Saturday and Sunday), they were packed. Plenty of parking in the lot, though.\nThe inside is massive and nicely decorated. I never made a trip to the restroom, but I did hear that they are very nice too. :-P\nEach time I've been there, all 4 of usl left completely stuffed, and we each spent about $12 for the food we shared.",3
"Where to begin? Upon approaching, we had no idea if the place was even open, no hours posted that we could see, so I got out of the car to check. I opened the door and there was a couple sitting at the bar, no other customers were there. We were were greeted by a young man who told us to take a seat anywhere. Since every booth was open, we took one close to the bar. Maybe he was getting off his shift, but he didn't take our drink orders or anything else, that's ok, you want to go home, I get it. He proceeded to stare at his phone and the POS screen near the kitchen entrance for a while before leaving. its ok, just ignore us. After waiting for about 10 minutes, our server/bartender came back inside through the back door after smoking a cigarette I presume. We finally got our drink order taken. 2 waters. Easy. After 5 more minutes, and chatting with the couple at the bar, we got our waters and she walked away. It's been 20 minutes since we sat down, I guess she'll get our food order later, because there is no way we know what we want to order after sitting here for so long. The couple at the bar leaves so our server is forced to give us all the attention she has. We order grilled asparagus to start, one peppercorn burger medium well, and one turkey burger. The grilled asparagus came out and was lukewarm at best. Tasted blanched, rather than grilled. Disappointing. Lets talk about how my med well burger was completely overlooked. Lets talk about how the turkey burger was darker in color than the beef burger and tasted like it was seasoned with allspice or cinnamon? Gross. Extremely dry too. I heard such great reviews when this place opened, and it seems to have gone completely downhill. A lot of people say \""head west and get a better burger at delux\"", I say \""head even further west and get a better burger at Wendy's\"".",0
"The worst food ever!\n It was embarrassing how bad the food was. It was nothing more than microwaved, canned, pre packaged junk. I had their sample plate small size, not sure what it was called.It took them 3 minutes after taking our order to food on the table. Should have been a red flag. It was microwaved so hot it was ridiculous.Rubbery shell, dry burnt meat in the taco, oh my It was not edible at all. On a Monday night at 7 pm,  also dirty tables all around I will never eat here again! The salsa was bottled junk again. Chips were ok that's about it.  Dont waste your time or money on this place.",0
"I like this location to others. nothing like the taste of the walmart of coffee. I dig the layout.\n\nlots and lots and lots and lots and lots of first world problems in the reviews for this place.\n\n a whole lot of, \"" my milkshake, my milkshake\"". \n\nCause if you put that much sugar and caramel and mocha in your coffee you are drinking a milkshake.\n\nMeanwhile in the third world.....\n\nShame, Shame Chandler.",3
#66 is the best!! I have recommended it to everyone that goes there and not one person has disagreed with me.,3
"Tucked away little hole in the wall restaurants generally fall into two categories: authentic little gems or somewhere you might get dysentery. \n\nBurger Factory falls solidly into the latter. I got the Chicken Enchilada plate with rice and beans. The red sauce was pretty good, but most likely came out of a can. The rice and beans were alright, but buried beneath a generous helping of lettuce, guacamole and what I think was tzatziki sauce. I mean, sour creme generally doesn't come with herbs and seasoning in it. \n\nThe chicken -- if that was what it was -- was barely recognizable nuggets of meat. Fatty, tough and rubbery in texture, the meat caused me to give up barely a quarter of the way into the meal. After I dumped the rest of the food in the trash, I brushed my teeth. \n\nI won't be returning.",0
"We made a beeline here after the rave reviews and, forewarned, we weren't expecting a fancy place. Maybe it was because we were looking forward to it so much that our expectations were somewhat dimmed. The food was generally average, we felt. My Vindaloo was spicy enough but the meat was a bit tough and, temperature-wise, could've done with being hotter. The naan was not great and didn't seem fresh or have that \""just cooked\"" fluffiness. Service was adequate, but slow, as there was a steady stream of people picking up takeouts. You help yourself to soft drinks from a chiller at the back. The prices were reasonable. Sorry, other lovers of this place, but Mother India is miles better (and not a lot more expensive) so we'll be sticking to that, or Kebabish.",1
"I've been coming here since early 90's and only once have I been disappointed.  Food portions are great...chef is funny and skilled.  Tonight, had the Geisha Special and it was delicious yet again.",4
"We went there for the lunch special.  I had broccoli chicken and my mom had vegetarian.  Both were drowned in a salty sauce.  I recommend getting the sauce on the side.  Otherwise, the food was ok.   Mine came in a smallish bowel.  If you don't want to get full at lunch time, it's perfect.\n\nService was very friendly and fast.  Prices were ok for the amount served.  It's pretty quiet in there, so people can hear your conversation if anyone pays attention at all.",1
Tried to redeem a coupon from the Entertainment Book at this location. I made sure the coupon said KFC Express. After showing this to the order person she got the manager. He not only almost threw back the coupon at me but would not even do a manager override or special. I responded by taking my money elsewhere in the food court. They were totally unhelpful and apparently they have enough business. I say go elsewhere for a positive snack purchasing experience.,0
"I went to Vegas for a conference last month. It was pretty convenient to get to the restaurant from the Strip. The bus stop was outside of the Venetian Palazzo hotel and the China town was 3 stops away. For $3, you can get a round-trip.\nThe food in Yun Nan Garden is definitely authentic. I love their noodle soup. I also tried the Beijing yogurt and their small plates. You can order 3 appetizers on a small plate. I picked spicy beef, duck and a veggie dish. All were delicious and absolutely authentic.",4
Second time was not so good. I have a feeling the martinis on my empty stomach encouraged me to leave a very generous review after our first trip. Don't waste your time or money. Atmosphere is loud and food left my stomach in ruins for a few days after.,1
"The first time I came to Vegas, we were staying at the Paris, which apparently is just too full of functional, non-gambling or drinking adults with children for me and my girls, so we headed for the Sahara and its $2 No Bust Blackjack tables.  We basically spent our entire vacation at those tables.  The dealers were fun and friendly, even the pit bosses chatted with us.  Okay, granted, we were there for like three staff changes (no sleep is necessary in Vegas due to all that extra oxygen they pump onto the casino floor) but they really were cool.\n\nMinus two stars for Paco's Bar and Grill.  A steady 13 hour diet of Bud Light clouded my judgment to the point of thinking that eating Mexican food at a desert-themed, low-budget casino would be a good idea.  Well, Bud Light was wrong and I scored some impressive FBI (food borne illness) but danged if I didn't lose 5lbs on that trip.\n\nI still love the Sahara, though, and I continue to return for blackjack every time I'm in Vegas.  Come on, it has its own \""NASCAR Experience\"" in it!  I don't know what that is, but I'm pretty sure it's Bud Light and crappy Mexican food, which sure as hell beats cappucinos and mimes at the Paris any day!",2
"My worst dining experience while working in Pittsburgh. Up until tonight I've thought \""these are the nicest people I've met\"" more than any other city I've worked in recently. Soba's staff has cured me of that. Food was good not great and my server acted as though my table of one was a bother even though I spent 60 bucks and ate within an hour with a 20% tip. My co workers were interested in checking this place out before we all head back to Los Angeles but I'll let them all know it's not worth a visit. Pittsburgh has some great restaurants but this is not one of them.",2
Beer and Drink prices were very low bathrooms were the worst ever hands down. Sat night tho the place to be Party Party Party,2
"Went in yesterday, with a friend of mine. Service was ok, the server just checked on us a minimal amount. Ordered beef tips, and was very pleased with my choice, but needed a to-go box. Packed up my leftovers, left the packed box of food on the table, and headed to the ladies room and my friend came with me, came out and our table was cleaned off, including my to-go box. Found my waiter who had apologized and offered to make a new smaller portion. Did not have time to wait, so declined. Just irritated that they couldn't wait a few moments to be sure the guests had left before they pitched my stuff. I did appreciate the quick way to resolve the issue though.",3
"Our experience here was a train wreck. Complete incompetence. On the plus side, The store is relatively clean, competitively priced, and no one was rude, but we picking up the order we placed online (that should have been waiting for us) was a scavenger hunt. \n\nFirst, the customer service person told us to go to the computers department, but on our way there, we saw a sign for networking and figured our router might be there. The employee in that department told us our router would be at the cashier but the modem would be in the computers department (not together for some reason even though we ordered them together). At the computers department, we couldnt find anyone to help us, so we went to the cashier. When we got to the cashier (after waiting in line), she was confused and needed a manager to tell her that our order was waiting back in the computers department. We waited for her to walk back and get it. We were surprised when she asked for a credit card even though we had entered that already online. Apparently they don't charge the card until you pick it up (in case you don't have the patience for the chaos, perhaps?). Lastly, the cashier told us they didn't have bags when we asked her to bag our purchased items. We managed to convince her to put each item in its own small plastic bag. Far from ideal, but we managed to eventually get out of there with what we needed.",0
"UPDATE UPDATE UPDATE:\nSince I worte my last review of thi splace, I hace since gone back. I went this past Labor day weekend for lunch. I am so very very disappointed. The menu prices have gone up so much. Lunch and dinner used to be a decent price, now they have gone up nearly 2 bucks for each entree. They also used to include a small bowl of soup with lunch, now it is 4.95 for it!!!! On top of all this, they provide only ONE refill of your beverage at lunch. So sad that the owners seem to have gotten very greedy and began to overprice. Despite this being one of my favorite Mexican resturants of all time, the price, quality and greed will not allow me to go back. I will look for something new.\n\nYou may never find another Mexican food resturant like this. WOW WOW WOW!!!!!  The food, awsome, the service, awsome, the price, awsome.  This family has done so well, and knows how to treat a customer!",1
"Let me start off by saying I've been to this Quiznos over 20 times, and that's a conservative estimate.  Last year they had probably a 25% failure to make the right sandwich rate.  But they have Improved this year to about 10% though.  It can be a good place to eat if you follow a couple guidelines.  First off,  never tell them what you don't want on sandwich.  Even though the ingredients are clearly listed behind them they will look at you like your speaking another language.  Tell them \"" I want an x with just the y and z\"".   Next,  don't tell them what veggies you want before theyve cooked it.  They will forget it or look at you weird.  It's kind of a hassle because you have to keep track of your sub through the cooking process but that's just the way they do it.  Follow those rules if you wanna have a good meal.\n\nAlso if the manager is reading this yelp review like any good manager should then Know this:  every single time anyone orders a sub at your quiznos they are asked if they want it for here to go twice? Is the first one just for fun?  That's a lack of communication that reflects poorly on every single customer that comes through.",1
"Once upon a time, before greedy traders and corrupt banks and people's inability to save money launched the U.S. into the second Great Depression, you could find a lot of German and Polish restaurants and food stores in the Valley.  Sadly, like the retirement accounts of so many so-called middle class Americans, these places have vanished along with their many customers, who no longer can afford to spend money on such non-essential luxuries.\n\nFortunately, Warsaw Village survived the economic catastrophe, though, like lots of businesses, it did so by considerably paring down its selection to avoid wastage and lost revenues therefrom.  Sadly, the shelves are no longer full in this store and for those who remember 'the good days', it's sort of sad to see.  Some of the now missing items are in the back; but a lot of it simply isn't carried anymore, because there just aren't as many customers showing up to buy anymore (or so it seems).  Every time I want to stop by here to pick up something, I always get a little churn in the pit of my stomach ... II keep expecting to show up and they won't be there anymore.\n\nWhile places like Jana's Bakery has (finally) expanded their selection of non-bakery items on sale, Warsaw Village is still the place to go in the West Valley (actually, the WHOLE Valley) to buy a wide assortment of Polish dry goods, meats, alcohol, pickled vegetables and, especially, pierogi.  Their selection just can't be beat and they don't try and bulk up their offerings by throwing in Bosnian and other former Yugoslavian items, like many 'ethnic' places do to make it seem like they have more than they do.  None of that cheap, sketchy stuff is here:  the overwhelming majority of what they have on hand is Polish or made by places in the States specializing in Polish foodstuffs.  It simply is THE place to go to buy all these things (sadly, though, you need to skip the bread and Makowiec they pick up from other bakeries in the area ... they're usually not fresh by the time you get to it here).\n\nMaybe, one day, when all the financial misery is behind us, places like Warsaw Village will once more open up and thrive as they did in better days.  For now, go and look and buy ... you may not have the opportunity to do so tomorrow.",3
"After reading the reviews and seeing this place had over 800 reviews with a 4-star plus rating, I figured it had to be amazing.  Well, I stand corrected.  I am torn on whether or not to give it 2 or 3 stars, but went with 2 as \""Meh. I've experienced better.\""  In fact, for the price, I've experienced A LOT better! We went to the restaurant to try their summer pre fixe menu pairings.  The restaurant was somewhat difficult to locate in the restaurant \""circle\"" off Paradise.  Upon entering the restaurant we were greeted by teenage hostesses in fish net stockings.  Not very classy.  We read online that the attire was business casual and we dressed for the occasion, only to find a restaurant full of shorts and t-shirts.  I'm not uppity, and I understand Vegas is by and large casual, but that left something to be desired.  Upon being seated we got a waitress whose appearance was unkempt, and when my fiancee asked a question about the menu she proceeded to start talking over her about the specials of the evening and continue through her spiel.  Upon ordering dinner, I requested a glass of whisky to enjoy with my steak.  The glass of whisky made it out after our meal.  We both ordered our Filet's medium rare, and when they arrived they were more well than rare, and very dry.  The server did request we cut into them to make sure \""they were absolutely perfect\"" when they arrived, which was a nice touch.  After much prodding by management, my fiancee agreed to send her steak back for a new one as she didn't want to be a burden or waste food.  The attentiveness was nice, but the steak they brought back the 2nd time (even with my fiancee expressing switch it to \""rare\"" instead) was even more cooked than the first.  Let me be clear, the food was not terrible.  However, for the level of reviews this restaurant has, and the prices they command ($200 after tip for the 2 of us), it is hardly 4-star plush worthy.",1
Counter service.  Not overly friendly service.\n\nChips were good.  Veggie burrito was okay.  Would eat it again but not go out of my way for it.  \n\nEntertainment coupon is only good at dinner time.  :(,2
"Long wait, poor service and average food at best really took the wind out of what had been a fun morning at the strip. Will not be back.",0
"I usually really love the vegan pizza, but today I got it by the slice and it was horrible. I got it to go and when I got home 5 minutes later, it was cold. I don't want to give them less then 3 stars because I really like the place. But I spent way too much money on cold pizza that didn't taste good anyways.\n\nI'll probably go back, but I am never getting pizza by the slice again.",2
"My one big tip: note that on Saturdays and Sundays, they only have the brunch menu, and do not serve the lunch menu. Worth noting, as I was hoping to get the Pork Tenderloin, and my wife was hoping to get the pressed Cuban burger- neither was available on the brunch menu.\n\nThat being said, holy crap so good. I watch Top Chef regularly, but I'm not the most adventurous eater out there (don't like seafood, I'm weird like that). So what I liked most about this place is that the food has the quality, taste and presentation you'd expect from a professional, but it's all riffs on food you already know and like.\n\nThe highlight was definitely the breakfast quesadilla- two very crispy tortillas with bacon, cheese, hash browns, chiles and onion goodness, with salsa and an egg on top to crack and let the yolk run over it (not usually my thing, but worked great here). Just layer upon layer of flavor and texture.\n\nWith the lunch menu unavailable, I got the pork tenderloin sandwich and my wife got their standard burger. The fries were actually the highlight, very crispy and well seasoned with a unique smokey flavor. My sandwich was very good, but not at the level of the quesadilla (same with my wife's burger).\n\nAll this said, I can't wait to come back and get the dishes we were hoping to get from the lunch menu. If you're a steak and potatoes kind of guy but want to try something that looks and tastes more gourmet, this is the place to visit.",4
I previously craved this place and was a very very frequent customer.  The service went steadily downhill....and the last time I dined there I was very sick for 2 days.  I even tried to call the manager who did not seem at all interested in hearing about our experience.   Sadly I am not going back.,0
"Sorry, $7.77 used to be a deal. It's no longer one.  You have to order a drink. A Budweiser bottle was $6.  The service is also extremely slow.  This place was empty and it took forever to get our food.",0

"One word \""EW!!\"" the only reason it gets 2 stars is because I'm sure it was just a bad room. Upon arriving, check in was quick. Got to our room and as I walk into the bathroom to go pee, I notice the ground is dirty. Whatever, I always wear sandals anyways. Open the lid and there are a couple pieces of unknown hair! I really hope they weren't pubes but I didn't look at them close enough. Gross. Do they not clean the bathroom? Also, the tissue box was disgusting. As for the gambling, these dealer we had was very monotonous. I did not enjoy her at all and I'm glad my boyfriend only played a couple hands even though he lost $100. I understand this is downtown and most of the hotels aren't that great but come on, learn how to clean a bathroom!!",1

I ate here for the first time today and OMG their food is so tasty! I'm super happy that I no longer have to drive to la anymore to get that awesome garlic sauce! I don't think there's any other restaurant in Las Vegas that sells it! Simply amazing!,4
checked into the Luxor at 1:30 am and needed a cocktail after a long journey.  We were treated great while using our first gambling dollars before going to sleep.,4
I received a call from the owner explaining in detail what happened. I can say that I appreciate her honesty and her attention to customer service and satisfaction. I will definitely be going back to Bond.,4
"This is my favorite Compare, though it seems older and smellier than the others I have been to. I love their produce, why is it so much cheaper than other mainstream Stores? My Wife is Cuban, so we buy our supplies here, in bigger quantities and for less $$$ than the other Stores. Its definitely not the same as shopping in an American style Store, but if you're looking for Hispanic goods, there is no place better!",3
"Really disappointed by this place. Had relatives in town for a wedding And needed same-day laundry service. I called the place like 8:45 AM to ask about same-day service and was told, \""as long as you are hereby 10 AM.\"" I arrived at 9:40 AM with the close and asked the lady to have them laundered same-day and she told me, \""sorry. They already picked up the bags.\"" She was very polite about it In fact she was a bit snarky In her tone. I pointed at this HUGE sign that they have hanging in the store that reads in big letters IN BY 10 OUT BY 5 And I Told her it was 20 min. before 10 and she again said sorry and that was it. This really threw a wrench  in my day because by this time I was too late to go to a different dry cleaner. If you're going State same-day service 10 to 5 Then don't tell people on the phone to be there by 10 AM. Or have An advertisement sign stating that fact. It's false advertising  and a disservice to customers.",0
"To summarize the food we had was great the service and waitress we had was terrible to say the least.\n\nWe tried to make a reservation ahead of time and of course it's very busy because it's a brand new and first giada restaurant.  We were informed by the hostess to come in and try to get a seat in the bar area as it was not a very busy night. Beware if you sit in the bar area it is a different menu than the regular dining.  We arrived and checked with the hostess and she showed us where we could sit in the lounge next to the bar. This is when the terrible experience started.... Keep in mind this is a Tuesday night and while all tables were full it was not busy other than that.\n\nIt took around 15 minutes to first be greeted by any server. We then got greeted by one server and got told another one would be around right away. 5 minutes later she came around.  We informed her that we would be eating in the lounge area and ordered drinks.  My girlfriend had a bad dairy allergy so we thought all of the vegan options on the regular menu would make this a great place to go.  Unfortunately the lounge menu had no vegan options, when asking the waitress for possible options without dairy she suggested ONE appetizer and was not knowledgable at all. When asking about other items she said she would check with the kitchen.. While she did that we ordered the one item.  We also asked for the bread provided to all customers who are dining which we NEVER received.  A kitchen staff brought the one item we ordered out and it was delicious.  Our waitress finally came back 10 minutes later and did not give us any information on the non dairy items nor did she bring over any bread. I did not want to wait any longer so I asked for the check stating that it didn't seem like the dairy allergy could be accommodated.  Meanwhile I know from looking at the full menu there are vegan items. The waitress did not even try and stop us from leaving or ask kitchen staff for recommendations.  It was truly a bad experience.  \n\nI had very high hopes for the restaurant. And it was the most anticipated dinner on our vacation. But to avoid my girlfriend being embarrassed or trying to deal with terrible waiting staff I can say I will not be coming back or recommending this to anyone else.",0
"GREEN CHILE CHICKEN BURRO! AIYIYIYIYIYIYIYI! [/battlecry]\n\nDon't argue - it was featured in the Arizona Republic six years ago. This is the one place that I've remained a faithful customer to for the last 6 years. This is by far my longest love affair.\n\nThis probably isn't real Mexican food, but who cares. You like Panda Express, don't you? You can't go wrong with the tacos, tostadas, and buttered tortillas. Don't forget to stock up the salsa. It's amazing. I've seen people fight to the death for this stuff. Really.",2
"Excellent restaraunt. Great food and service. Pad Thai was really good and so was the service. Valet on Church street side makes it an even better option. Highly recommend this place. It was spicy enough for me, but if you like your food crazy  hot, definitely tell the server to kick it up a notch.",3
Good food. Way too chaotic!  Very loud. Nowhere to sit because tables aren't bused. Half the price of PF Chang's but miss the ambiance.,2
"Funny name - great work. \n\nI got three estimates to paint my house. I didn't know much about Crash of Rhinos but Mike impressed me with his comments and his suggestions. When I told him we were unsure of the colors he volunteered to have Kim come out and take some pictures and then she could digitally paint our house with a few of the finalists. We took pictures and Kim was very helpful.\n\nThe crash of rhinos (they really aren't big enough to be called rhinos) came out when they were supposed to and went to work.  They covered everything that needed to be covered and moved everything that needed to be moved.  My house is stucco and had a few cracks along with some nicks and dings. They fixed all of that as well as replacing a few trim boards that were damaged.\n\nThe interior of my house is about 3,000 sq. ft. It's a single story with a 3 car garage. There's a lot of exterior that needed to be painted.  They got the job done in 4 1/2 days with a crew that ranged in size from 3 to 5.\n\nExcellent job and I'm getting compliments from the neighbors.\n\nHighly recommended.",4

"Hubby and I booked a night here for our visit to the US Consulate General, which is just down the street. Boulevard Rene-Levesque does not have any cheap hotels, and you don't want to commute in from the suburbs for an ass-crack-of-dawn appointment. We sucked it up and paid for a room at the QE.\n\nYes, they nickel-and-dime you. Internet use in the room cost extra, as did the pretty-much-mandatory valet parking. There's cheaper parking within a ten minute walk of the hotel, but it was all outdoors, from what I could see. If you're worried about weather or crime at all, pay for the valet parking. The valet service is great if you like that sort of thing -- personally, I would prefer being able to walk to my car and get things out of it myself, rather than having someone bring me the car and accidentally charge me for parking twice. (Yes, we got that fixed when we left.)\n\nWe were too tired to spend time looking too hard for cheap food, especially because it was Sunday night and we weren't sure what would be open. But within a ten-minute walk there's a mall with a small IGA supermarket and two food courts, and if you go up to Rue Ste.-Catherine you'll find all the fast food. If you want to splurge, the hotel has three swanky restaurants plus there are several more a few doors down. \n\nThe hotel is gorgeous inside, without being glitzy. It's classy rather than ostentatious. The single queen bed room that we got was a bit on the small side, and I think the bed was smaller than a queen, but it was really plush and comfy. Everything was clean and pretty much perfect. One thing that you don't have to pay extra for: use of the in-room Keurig for your morning coffee. \n\nIf you're sensitive to perfumes, do not open the Le Labo Rose 31 toiletries. Whoooeeee. I liked them but I feel the need to warn those with allergies. \n\nThe full star off is for all the little extra charges. Otherwise this is a great place to stay for a romantic weekend or a little pampering on a stressful trip. Someday I'll bring lots of money and get the whole experience, rather than just sleeping and being off again.",3

"places like this really make me wonder about yelp reviewers.  4 1/2 stars?  you have got to be kidding me.  these chefs know nothing about Mexican flavors.  started with guacamole (at least I thought I did.  it actually came out 5 minutes after my tacos).  the avocado wasn't quite ripe which made the texture somewhat unappealing.  it also lacked flavor.  I squirted a little lime juice in it which kinda helped.  as for the tacos, blah.  the famous crispy taco was pretty boring and the mashed potato was gag worthy.  the pork taco wasn't bad but at 4 bucks I'm gonna put it in the fail category.  finally, the barbacoa taco shared the same fate.  for a place that supposedly specializes in tacos, Imperial has a lot of work to do.  go try the lamb tacos at carson kitchen if you really want to be blown away.  and, they make their own tortillas.  almost forgot to mention the beer.  they were out of the one I wanted.  that fact, combined with the lack of front of the house service, and a mostly empty restaurant at dinner time, lead me to believe this place is in serious trouble.",1
Excellent place to go for lunch!  One line for salads and another for sandwiches.  I got a cobb salad to go and it was REALLY good!  All of the ingredients were fresh.  The service as fast.  I will go here again the next time I'm in Charlotte downtown to work.,3
"Look for another doctor. Don't wast your time. If I could rate 0 stars I would.\n\nDr. Alamo is rude and arrogant. He doesn't make much eye contact and seemed disinterested in discussing symptoms past related medical history. Was very quick to make recommendations for costly tests. I spent more time sitting in the waiting room and with an asst then I did with him. I can see he is a busy doctor but if health is so important to him then giving a little better care to patients is not asking too much. I enjoyed receiving a letter of severance in the mail today 10/19/2012 that was dated 10/03/2012 noting he will no longer be my doctor. This stems from my calls to his office trying to get test results, a request for his recommendations in writing for me to review and noting to his staff how poorly he treats patients and that I would be looking for another physician. I did not get the requested list of his recommended tests.",0

"I've been here 2 times in the last 2 weeks, and this place is pretty good.  The service I received was excellent!  When I went for lunch, the atmosphere was very relaxed, and the bartender was very attentive.  Same goes for breakfast, even though it was much busier during the breakfast visit (I overheard a server saying they're busiest during the breakfast times).\n\nFor breakfast, I went with a tried and true, biscuits and gravy, which comes with 2 eggs, 2 pieces of bacon, and potatoes.  My server asked me if I wanted some chorizo on my potatoes, which was unexpected, but later I saw that their lunch special was tacos with chorizo.  I probably should have steered clear of the chorizo, as it was a bit much, but I didn't look at the special board before I came in.  For those who like extras though, it was nice that he offered and didn't charge for it.  The biscuits were slightly disappointing, I'm sad to report.  They had a good flavor, but they were a little overbaked to the point where they were almost hard.  Also, the parts that didn't have gravy on them actually tasted of slightly burned biscuit.  :(  This saddened me, but didn't take away from the meal too much.\n\nWhen I went for lunch the previous week, I got the grilled chicken sandwich, which comes with bacon on it and avocado.  The sandwich tasted awesome!  This time, the only downside was a matter of mechanics.  The bacon/avocado would not stay between the bun (which was a bacon focaccia, I believe... yum!) when I'd bite into it.  Not that big of a deal.  I mean, the sandwich fillings were hefty!\n\nAnyhow, good food here.  Excellent service.  Try it out if you're in the neighborhood!",3
"Had my first haircut there the other day by the uncle.  After years of going to the same type of barber, old Italian guy, and getting decent but uninspired haircuts I decided to give this place a try after reading Yelp reviews.  Am I ever glad I did.  I left it up to the barber to do what he felt would suit me the best given my fine hair type and age (late 40s).  He took time to study all the variables and then recommended a fade.  He worked on my head for over 35 minutes even though they were busy and did a fantastic job. The price is a true bargain at $15 plus a generous tip for his effort and genuine friendliness.  I have never gotten so many compliments on a haircut and feel really good about its appearance.  Highly recommend this place.",4
"I use to enjoy coming here, but it seems like the food has gone down hill slightly for the price.

The last time I stopped in the pastry was dried out and the coconut cupcake was partially frozen.  Also the coffee wasn't hot and the bar girl had an attitude when I asked if she had any newly brewed.  Nothing verbal just a snippy push of an airpot in my direction.  They have tried to improve service, still some mistakes on take away, ie; wrong pastries.  Parking is insane as it has been for several years. \nI think they should get rid of one of the retail displays and allow just a tad more room in front of the coffee bar.  I thought a fight would erupt one day recently when the place was packed and there was a girl waiting to get coffee and her friend asked if she was ready, she replied that if she would be if people would stop hogging the coffee bar.  I thought she was being funny and must know the guy in front of her, but by his look when he turned to look at her, I realized they weren't together.  I waited for the verbal burst of profanity, but none came and I applaud his patience with the uppity little wannabee.  I've had better, but I am here and there aren't too many other alternatives for counter service.  One suggestion for LGO, please use biodegradable take-away containers.",1
"This place sucks.  Ordered the simplest thing, an 18 inch with mushroom and pepperoni.  When calling to place the order, they asked cash or credit, and we said cash. After over an hour, this smug delivery guy shows up and asks for 21.50.  All I had were two 20s - and he only had 6 dollars in change!  He didn't even apologize or try to fix the problem, just gave me a smug look and took 34 dollars for a 21 dollar order!  Real classy.\n\nAnd the pizza was cold, greasy, and generally quite awful.  Super stingy with toppings.  \n\nAvoid this place at all costs.  An absolute rip-off that makes a sucky pizza.",0
"I am torn now, because I LOVE Qdoba, but the Pork here is unreal and the drink bar is great! One more in love visit and they will get 5 stars and replace Qdoba.",3
"Just the worst for travel. Shuttle waiting more than hr at the airport until the whole shuttle was full (I had been told they left ever 15 min), then shuttle was more than 20 min late picking back up for return trip. Customer service was unhelpful and rude. So much extra stress on travel day; it's way overpriced for level of service. Stay away.",0
"We went to their lunch buffet.  They have moved into the space that was previously Indus Village.  Now, Indus Village had AMAZING food.  Copper Kettle's food has always been ok, but nothing to rant and rave about.  They used to be located on Dobson and Guadalupe but moved recently to this new location on Alma School and Warner.  \n\nThe food quality seems to have gone down.  $11 for the lunch buffet.  Some of the dishes were COLD!!!!  I would not recommend.  Customer service is hit-and-miss depending on who is helping you.",1
"I give the restaurants five stars and happy hour in the bar (saloon). three stars. The restaurant menu is fantastic, I've tried many dishes and they're all good quality. My current favorite is the California citrus salad.   The happy hour food menu is unimpressive, tried several items and they were all at best average. Skip happy hour in the bar and head straight to the restaurant. \n\nI would also like to note that I always receive friendly, good service from the wait staff here.",3
"Guter Laden um Pizza zu essen oder zu holen. Der vegetarische D\u00f6ner ist in Ordnung, wenn auch das Brot nicht selbstgemacht ist. Die Pizza ist aber auf jeden Fall besser als bei vielen anderen L\u00e4den und vor allem als bei Joeys nebenan!",2
"Great salsa, bean dip, and menu selection. The spinach enchilada was delicious. Didn't get to try there home brew. I would return",3
"Am I the only one who thinks Balls would be a great name for a sports bar? But. Here in gay ole Phoenix. We have Roscoes. While they'd like everyone to think it's a sports bar for everyone. Really. It's gay people. Gay as Ross the Intern. As gay as Richard Simmons sparkly, spandex onesies. Gay. Gay. Gay. Rainbow flags. Gay rags by the door. And, well, a sea of psuedo gocks (that's gay/jocks FYI). They offer descent 2 4 1 drink specials on Tuesday. The obligatory \""sports\"" bar furnishings include a couple pools tables, dart boards, pin ball machines and TVs. While I haven't been in a while, the service was always smooth and efficient. Much more than I can say about my talent at billiards. Or darts. Or pinball. But watching TV. I'm pretty good at that. So, put your jockstrap on, face your baseball cap backwards and drink plenty of Bud Lite while cheering on the DBacks. Or. Wait for figure skating season, wear something with sequins, drink Cape Cods and cheer for a Tanya Harding-Nancy Kerrigan rematch.",2
I could not resist and went back to this place again.  The food is so good.  I just wish the people were nicer.,2
"Won't even try to deny it.  I'm a Bath & Body Works junkie! \n\nThere's a Wallflower in almost every room of my house; hand soap in my bathrooms and kitchen. \n\nIf B&BW ever discontinued the Sensual Amber, Forever Red or Country Chic body care lines, I might curl up and die- been using Sensual Amber since 2007! \n\nYeah, you get the picture. \n\nAssociates are always super helpful and fun to chat with whether you're looking for something new to try, getting your standbys or simply browsing on your lunch break.\n\nLook for Buy 3, get 3 free on body care. 4 for $20 Wallflowers. 5 for $15 hand soaps. Sometimes 2 for $22 candles!  \n\nWhy this review lost two stars: One of the managers! Lady is extra pushy on sales, so forget a peaceful \""window shopping\"" session. Have witnessed her being an angel in the face of customers, then an absolute troll to her associates in the same breath. Just plain awful.  \n\nAlso, as a previous reviewer mentioned: She will always assume you're shoplifting, especially if you're on a mission and know exactly what you're going to purchase. Space bubble: Please respect it!\n\nBut overall, great customer service and products! Will I continue shopping here? You betcha!",2
"So for being featured on DDD, I expected a little more than what I got to be honest.  We arrived on a Sunday morning at 8:15 and waited a half hour, which I was fully expecting from the other reviews.  I was underwhelmed by the limited menu but understand that it has to be that way to turn the tables as fast as they need to in order to accommodate the crowd waiting outside.  My omelet was alright and my husband got the salami scramble which he did enjoy.  The sourdough toast, homemade jam and fragrant squeezed OJ was what I enjoyed the most.  I would recommend to visitors but honestly don't know if I would continue to come here and wait as a regular.",2
"If I could give 0 stars I would. WORST AIRLINE EVER! I booked off Expedia and there was no mention that when I got to the airport I would be PAYING 50$ for a carry on!! Unbelievable! I totally understand the fee for a checked bag but a small carry on? Unreal. The horrible staff said I would still be paying less than a flight on another airline. WRONG. Had I booked the other flight on virgin that was almost booked I would pay 5$ more when booking on Expedia however wouldn't have to spend the 50$ EACH way for my carry on. Now to the problems while AT the airport. I'm flying an hour flight And I'm delayed over 2 hours. Not for weather or something uncontrollable. For \""aircraft maintenance\"". Which means the AIRLINE wasn't prepared. And what do they do to compensate? Absolutely NOTHING. I will NEVER FLY THIS AIRLINE AGAIN! And unless they refund my flight or bags or something! I will make sure everyone I know, including my 3,000 fb friends, family, etc know how horrible of an airline this is. I will be surprised if you are still in business within the year. I fly way to often to deal with this over priced, rude, and trashy airline!! \nGood like spirit",0
"The people that work here are always very friendly and helpful. It's a pretty small place, but they have a good selection of ASU stuff at decent prices. Great items always on sale. I got my dad a nice ASU Dad t-shirt for about $15 and a cute blouse for myself for 40% off.  \n\n2 hour free parking is available just north of this location in n open parking lot from 6 or 8 am - 6pm, I think Monday through Friday. Sorry, I've forgotten  the exact days and start time. \n\nThey also currently have stuff for the teams playing in the Insight Bowl.",3
"Wilenski's is an important reminder of Montreal heritage. The Wilenski Special is the type of sandwich your parents would make you after school. It's simple and taste great. When I ate here, there were plenty of kids at the counter so popular with the youngsters for sure. While the decor is minimalist, the place is an iconic image of Montreal and the people who have frequented this place since the 30's.",4
"This place bills itself as \""New York Style\"" Chinese food.  Does that mean their menu is pretty rad?  Yes.  Does it mean those 90 different ads on their countertop?  Maybe, it's like a subway.  Is it the giant portions for low prices?  No, because nothing in NYC is under $50.  But together, it means it is a pretty good place to have lunch.    Skip the Kung Pao though, it's more peanuts than actual other products.",2
"Terrible, terrible! All the food tasted the same. Huge disappointment after so many nice meals at this hotel. Yelpers skip the buffet and save yourself the wait in line",0
"I enjoy coming here for my morning coffee and some snacks.\nI dislike the customer service the coffee lady provides. She's pushy, rude, and always has something smart to say. \nI find it sad that I have to wait for her to leave her shift just to avoid this lady. I don't see no point of her working there; she's useless. She doesn't show no interest in her job.",2
"My mouth is watering thinking about this place (I shouldn't write reviews when I'm hungry). 15 different sorts of meat, unlimited salad bar, yummy warm cheesy bread, and authentic Brazilian caipirinha = yum. \n\nI came here for date night and had a great time. Our server was really friendly and explained how the the steakhouse worked as far as meats and the salad bar. Each of the meat servers is actually a gaucho chef. I think our server said there were 18 of them. That means each of the gentlemen bringing you meat and carving it for you is actually the person preparing it as well. That was impressive and nice to know. \n\nAs far as the food, some of the meats were hit or miss for me.  The sausage was just meh, the bottom sirloin was a bit salty, but the picanha, alcatra, and parmesan crusted pork loin were so delicious.  Most of the meats were juicy but had a perfect fire roasted char on the outside. YUM.\n\nI know they have several areas they can convert to private rooms for functions or larger groups.  I talked to the service manager and he let me know there's no fee to rent a room and they can even split everyone's check individually in a party.  I'm definitely thinking about doing my graduation party here with my family and friends!",3
"Trolling around for some BBQ in the Veg. We lost my favorite BBQ joint Pit Boss BBQ. They just up and left and didn't give their customers the heads up if they were going to set up shop somewhere else. A lot of their fans were disappointed when they disappeared.\n\nThe homie tells me of this new joint chillen on D.I. and Highland. I'll pho'ks with it. I roll up and see huge smokers out front. Very good sign. I go inside thinking it's going to be another hole in the wall. Inside looks nice and accommodating. Lot's of places to sit and get down. \n\nSo I try and sample as much as I can. I get the trio combo and a half rack of baby back ribs. Hey! Don't diet! Try It!  \n\nTrio Combo:\nThe trio combo comes with brisket,  a hot link, pulled pork, some bread, a few pickle slices, a side (mashed potatoes), and a side of their BBQ sauce. Their hot link came in first, with their pulled pork and brisket comming in an honorable second. Their hot links stood out with the most flavor from this combo. Coming back for more of this tube steak. You can definitely taste the smokey flavor of their passion. \n\nBaby back ribs:\nThey difinitely have this one on lock down. Very smokey and tasty. How can you mess up baby back ribs? Fall off the bone with their tangy BBQ sauce makes this one a definite come back. \n\nBBQ sauce:\nTheir BBQ sauce has a tangy spicy taste to it which will linger with you after you finish feeding your face. They give you a lot of sauce with their BBQ and give you a side of more BBQ sauce just in case. There have been a couple of spots where they just give you a dab of BBQ sauce. Come on folks! Don't be stingy with your BBQ sauce.\n\nThis is a solid diamond in the rough. It's kind of tricky getting here. If you like BBQ, try this place out and support them. It's hard to find some solid BBQ in Vegas these days. They're doing a great job. I had the coworkers sample some of their BBQ when I got back from lunch. Definitely a new lunch spot for the gang. Still have to try their beef ribs and everything else that's on the menu.\n\n\nRollin Smoke Barbeque....EYE LIKA CHU PEOPLES!!!",3
"If you're looking for floor jacks, don't waste your time here. The AC Delco 2T jacks are very poor quality and workmanship and the 2T jack I purchased was damaged.

"OK Mexican Food, nothing extraordinary.... Chips & Salsa aren't anything special either.... The Chips always seem to come all broken up, & the Salsa is just average.  Not sure why the reviiewers are giving such high marks on the Chips & Salsa?  Sam's Cafe in the Arizona Center at 3rd St & Van Buren,  & Ajo Al's are WAY better!  \nThis place is always noisy!  Might wanna bring earplugs. The service is great!",2
"I could go on and on, but let me just say this... Definitely NOT even close to Mexican food! Not worth a $75 dinner for two people. I have to say the guacamole was good, but you can't go wrong with fresh ingredients made right in front of you.  Waiter was super busy and never around, nice guy but too sweaty!",0
"I got food here twice.  I rarely eat fast food but have a soft spot for egg mcmuffins; they don't seem THAT bad for you and are filling.  The first time, the English muffin part of it was just about burnt to a crisp and inedible (leaving me hungry until lunch).  The second time, it was barely toasted and the cheese was cold (giving it a much much much less desirable flavor).  This mixed with kinda rude staff (for those I've dealt with) on both occasions and I'm not going to make the same mistake a third time.",0
"Decent boba, but the tea could be better.  Coming from San Gabriel, its hard to compare this place to places such as half and half or au, but if you are in Las Vegas and reallllllly need boba, this isn't too bad of a choice.",1
"Oh my can't RAVE this one enough. Came to Madison for 1 night looked around for  \""out of the way\"" places stumbled across this one. Sherry was our waitress... ^5 Sherry. Asked what was good and she pointed out some great options. We were not told about some specials. Husband and I were celebration our 17 years of marriage. \n\nHubby ordered Chicken Marsala and he loved every ounce of it.... BTW he's not a big Italian food guy. I ordered Chicken Alfredo.... very good as well. We has STELLAR service as promised by Sherry. Very attentive and a wonderful server.... tell her Milwaukee told you about her. :)  \n\nAfter we were done with dinner we were surprised with a most WONDERFUL piece of Tiramisu. I have eaten a lot of this dessert but hands down this was the BEST!!! Very high quality and very flavorful... it was so good I closed my eyes and let it melt away slowly. \n\nHands down the best food from Milwaukee to Madison. \n\nwww.cafelabellitaliamadison.com",4
We stood in line for about 5 mins. I order the same thing every time I eat here which is a bowl with chicken and carnitas and everything on it. Love it!!,4

"I can't believe I'm reviewing RR and not giving it 5 stars but after my 4th visit, I'm averaging, the first 3 were 5 stars, the last visit, this year, only 3.\n\nWe just got back, and while it was still as amazing of a place- I mean they do know how to build a great hotel and keep it up- there was more problems this trip than I would have ever anticipated.  \n\nPreviously, I always said that this place spoiled me, nowhere I'd ever been had been so thoroughly perfect from reservation to check out, always stellar.\n\nThis time, check in was awful- they booked me into a room on 17th floor, gave me a key, I went up with bags, husband and tired 4 year old to find key didn't work.  Damn.  Had to go back down to desk to get new key.\n\nNew key worked, but room wasn't made up, at all. Bed covers were crumpled on floor, tv was blasting, newspapers and other things strewn around the room. Couldn't tell if someone was still in it or not, didn't want to keep snooping to find out.\n\nWent downstairs to get checked in room that was ready, got apology and key to new room on 12th floor. Went into room, clean, yes? FINALLY settling in, hubby tries internet -not working, says wrong name/room combo- figured it was his computer and went down to cafe to eat.\n\nAt cafe, chat with waitress (see her everytime, sweet lady) and when paying for dinner, find that the charge says our room number and name don't match up, another name is registered to that room.\n\nGO BACK TO FRONT DESK, am told we have been given room already registered (with active keys out there) to someone else. GREAT. The big offer is to have bell staff move our bags, which they do, to the VERY end of the hall away from elevator. Steaming mad at this point- oh, it's my hubby's birthday, did I mention?\n\nAfter complaining next day, they offered a $25 credit on room, but when checking out, no credit, had to go back and request it all over again.  \n\nOther 'lowlights' tub (luxurious and deep) water supply makes whole room (and neighbor's room) shake when filling, sounds like a mack truck in bathroom, shower handle so weirdly unhinged that only HOT or cold water come out- hot water so hot that it could burn your hand in less than 10 seconds. OUCH.  You also now need wristbands to get in the pool and you get your bags searched, no outside water? Seriously? You can bring in starbucks, though, so I filled my Frapp with Malibu for my own poolside cocktail. :) Cherry, the nightclub, is closed, not sure why, but doesn't reek of 'hot spot' so much anymore,  pool hours have always surprised me, that basically, after 7, it's closed, overcharged for 2 mini bar items although they actually cleaned out the mini bar to empty the third day with no explanation.\n\nThe rest of the place and our experience were still great, the room was really REALLY nice, the hotel staff -Tempest made up our room most days and was OUTSTANDING, Linda in the buffet was GREAT! and the weekly AM staff at the Village smoothies was sooooo NICE!\n\nWe'll be back next year, I'm hoping they've worked out the kinks, I can't bear to stop telling everyone this is the best place on the planet for a vacation with the kids or without!",3

"One of my favorite Vegas hotels. I've never stayed in the hotel, but you don't have to stay in a hotel in Vegas to like it!\n\nThe almost magical Bellagio fountains out in front of the hotel display an amazingly well coordinated light & water show set to great music (like Frank Sinatra)! It's cool during the day, but it's so much better at night when the lights in the water add another level of cool to the display!\n\nThe lobby has a beautiful blown glass ceiling in a rainbow of colors. Just beyond the lobby is an atrium that always kind of seems like a piece of Wonderland. The decorations they use change depending on the time of year, but it's always amazing and beautiful. This last trip out to Vegas, it was like you were bug sized in a huge garden---towering flowers, huge snails, big birds, kites attached to the ceilings, etc.\n\nThe casino is your normal casino, but it just has an air of being classy, which I enjoy.",4
Excellent service! Great food! Machaca beef chimmi and green chili Mac was delicious. Will be back!,4
"One of those great little task-specific indie stores, as unlike Joann's as you can get.  Large selection of fabric and buttons you don't find anywhere else, and well-organized service -- you stand in line to have your fabric measured and your buttons counted and then a cashier takes your money.  Found some terrific buttons for ten cents each button-diving in the loose button bin, and my niece found some wonderful rayon fabric at a quarter what she pays for it at home.  A pleasant experience all around.",3
"I usually bet burgers plain to start.   It has to stand alone first.  I got the Bison Burger, $15.00.  It was dry, I expected a dryer burger because the lack of fat in Bison.  Asked for Medium Rare, got Medium-Medium well.   I took a picture then enhanced it, to deepen the color.  I suggest you use the burger as a delivery system for toppings.  Put 3 of the strongest toppings, maximum sauces to give it flavor.   I would happily pay $5.00 or $6.00 for this burger.  I have had bison fir years, most of the time it has flavor, sometimes it tastes of feed lot....  No taste at all.    In fact I suggest you bring your own cheese, a Limburger, Maytag, or one of the strongest cheeses to give it something!   About a table spoon of Tobacco Sauce or  Dragons tongue pepper would help as well.   \n\nThe burger was from frozen bison and had to have been pressed, and turned serval times to get it that dry.  For $15.00 I expect fresh not frozen meat!   \n\nThe wait staff was very good.  I will not penalize the waitress to inferior food....  Or fast food quality burger.",2
"Ok - I've admitted my slight tendency toward curmudgeon in the past.  But I have to say, at the Clubhouse, it's as though they sort of knew me, and my curmudgeonly tendencies, and ran their operation accordingly.  \n\nYes, the spare van back seat that acts as a \""couch\"" in the back of the club is disgusting.  I wouldn't sit on it unless I was in a full hazmat suit.  Yes, the floor coats your shoes with a goop reminiscent of the 4H petting booth at the county fair.\n\nBut the troughs of expensive domestic 22's harken me back to my \""um, yeah, I'm 21 (insert guilty, underage look)\"" days, and truthfully?  seriously?  when i'm gripping my big ol deuce deuce of Coor's Light, I'm happy to be in the back of the house with the over-agers.  Then, when I've had enough watered down intoxicant to lube up my dancing shoes, I can migrate into the alcohol-less front of the house to rock out.\n\nIt's a grungy tribute to dirty musical venues, the Clubhouse.  The bathrooms are adequately disgusting, littered with \""Henry the bouncer is f'n hot!\"" and \""Go Vegetarian!\"" followed by \""They taste good, haha!\""  Which - is par for the course, I suppose, but disturbing considering the bouncer's shook us down for our pen, (a remnant of our 9-5'ism, which we were desperately trying to disguise)  leaving me only one conclusion:  these writers crotched their sharpies.  Now for heavens sakes, there are better things to crotch than markers when attending a show.  It nonetheless is a warning to leave found sharpies on the ground where they lie.  You never know where they've been carefully hidden.  Continue to steal them from your office, that's what office supplies are for.\n\nSo overall, there are lessons to be learned from The Clubhouse.  It's an above-average venue with an amply sized stage, adequate access to alcohol, a regularly security-oggled parking lot (which makes that desperate behind-the-dumpster pee rather difficult), and a decent amount of traffic by good artists.\n\nAll the normal annoyances abound, shaved arm dancers that want to cut you with their stubble by swaying off-beat and scraping up against you, the lurid smell of Monster energy drinks in the ticket line, the rambunctious youths hopped up on said drinks, the bouncer that stands in front of you, arms-crossed, waiting to see another waft of that devil-weed smoke rising above the underagers.  But it is not a wine and jazz club.  It is a show venue in a college-town.  In Phoenix / Tempe.  Not San Francisco / Detriot / Chicago or New York.  And I would be suspicious if it was less dirty.\n\nSo it's not bad.  Not bad at all.",2

"My aunt and uncle keep telling me about this italian restaurant at Red Rock Station. I kinda was \""eh\"" it's Italian until I ate there. Their Antipasto plate is comlimentary. When you walk in....there's a big wheel of parmaseano reggiano. BIG WHEEL!  I love cheese. That cheese was phenomitastic. It comes with a medley of olives  and roasted peppers and yes the zucchini chips. I got to try this shrimp that looked like they worked out at Muscle beach in Venice. HOLY CRAP. HUGE. Their lil diablo sauce was subtle yet flavorful. I tried the Spaghetti carbonara. It's definitely authentic enough. CHEESEY! \nI had this veggie pasta dish which was very flavorful and the picatta was excellent. Much better than mine. \nSo I watched Hell's Kitchen 1. How the hell did I  not know that this is the restaurant Hell's Kitchen 2 Heather was in??? WTF....yea I wanted to meet her. But then I got all shy. I'm far from shy. But I just don't like to bother people. I really do want to meet her though. you know swap recipes....shoot the sh*t....etc....\nOverall - great ambiance. Fresh flavorful foods. $$ not that pricey...but I didn't pay - Thanks Red Rock for the Comp :)",4
"JD and I stopped in for a late lunch on Superbowl Sunday.  The first thing that I noticed and loved was the salsa bar!  I am a salsa fanatic and always ask for a trough of it at every mexican restaurant I visit. How nice to be able to help myself! So we wasted no time ordering chips and a plain cheese quesadilla. I was in salsa heaven! We got every kind they had and mixed up some tasty concoctions. Chips were thin, crispy and great with salsa and our quesadilla was good too (I think it'd be hard to mess one up really)! \n\nI had a chicken soft taco and a cheese and onion enchilada, JD had a chicken burrito. The enchilada was the very best, covered in a spicy red sauce with just enough cheese. My chicken taco was fine but JD's burrito was pretty blah. He said it tasted like mush. I tasted it too and agreed, I think because all you could really taste was rice. There wasn't a whole lot of chicken in it. We agreed that the salsa bar and the enchilada saved the place from failing (in our eyes) and agreed to give it another go in the future.",3
"Located about 30 minutes from McCarren Airport or from the Las Vegas strip, the Hilton Lake Las Vegas Resort and Spa make a nice, low key alternative to the wild pace of Downtown.\n\nThe property is definitely still recovering from the Recession years!  The on-site casino is still closed.  About half of the hotel is under renovation as of this writing.  But, the property is lovely and nicely maintained.  It has a Florentine/Mediterranean feel to it.  There is only one restaurant in the hotel, though it serves a very nice buffet breakfast.  The nearby 'Village' is a bit depressing during the day as nearly half of the properties are still shuttered.  But there is a nice selection of reasonably-priced restaurants and in the evenings, particularly on the weekends, the place livens up considerably.\n\nThe staff was very welcoming and helpful in all regards.  The spa/fitness area was very pleasant.  The pool and beach/lagoon were comfortable.  It was fun renting a paddle boat and going around the lake.\n\nTwo other elements that lead me to a three-star vs. four-star review.  First, there were birds' nests under the eves outside our window.  On the one hand, this is kind of neat and interesting...some kind of mud swallow.  But the birds left a lot of bird poo on the window and windowsill, which was a bit unsightly.  Secondly, the shuttle arrangements between the airport, downtown, and the property are rather widely spaced.  We ended up renting a car and it worked out well.  The parking is ample.\n\nSo, we had a good time.  I hope, as the economy improves and they bring the property back to its full glory, to try it again in the future.",2
"I love this place.  The staff are very friendly and seem to want to get to know their customers. The atmosphere is nice, with a large garage door that is kept open in nice weather and good coffeehouse music playing. Their coffee is delicious with a variety of options to choose from. Their pastries and sandwiches are also very tasty. I work directly across the street from this place and I am so glad they opened up last summer.",4

"This review is for the Happy Hour only.  Server and bartender seemed overwhelmed and unprepared for how busy it was.  HH special \""CasaRita\"" took forever to arrive and was the worst margarita I've ever had :( -- so salty as to be undrinkable and no discernible tequila.

"The room is very comfortably arranged.  It welcomes you by opening the curtain, turning on the TV with mood music and lighting...Bathroom has double sinks, shower and tub.

Even if they could not have accomodated a group or taken a reservation someone should have followed up with a call or told me so.",1
"Chuck E Cheese....not for the faint of heart.  It's a mad house at these places and this one is right in line with that line of thinking.

But the real reason you come here obviously is for the kids and kids love tokens and they love those little tickets.  Oh, and forget about the food, ugh, nasty.  If you are lucky enough to drop $50 and get 100 tickets you too can have a pencil sharpner, 4 stickers and a mini slinky. :)",2
"Went here for Saturday brunch. The restaurant, however, is impossible to find. The maps can lead you to the Bouchon bakery kiosk by the Phantom Theater if you aren't paying attention.\n\nIt's not every day, after all, that you head into the parking garage and up an escalator that no one knows about, just to eat brunch.\n\nThe wait was short (they said 20 minutes, but it was more like 10). The service, unfortunately, was crap. Totally disappointing for a Thomas Keller restaurant, even if it is a more casual one. The food itself (Croque Madame for my girlfriend and quiche du jour for me) was good. The quiche was a bit on the small side (one slice for $12), but was a nice way to start the day.\n\nIf service was more prompt and attentive, they would've earned another star. It's also disappointing that you need to hike downstairs for the baked goods rather than being able to buy them in the restaurant.\n\nAlso, a Thomas Keller restaurant should really have fresh juice. Only the OJ, however, is fresh. The grapefruit juice is bottled, which is hilarious since even Treasure Island's buffet serves fresh grapefruit juice.\n\n====\n\nRubric: 5 = Mindblowing 4 = Excellent 3 = I see the charm 2 = Disappointing 1 = Never again",2
This place is more than wonderful! If you haven't been yet ....GO! The food it great.....especially the Kung Pao Veg. ....and the best part is....you get a ton of food for a great price. ...they also deliver which is really great...and I mean deliver...during the huge storm that hit down town last month I saw the siu wok dude drive through the mess on central and deliver food to people in our building...these people are serious! Go check them out!,4
"Hands down, this is the best BBQ I have ever had. Always go really early or wait until after 12:30 (although you risk there being less selection.) The brisket is amazing and I could eat my weight in jalapeno cheese grits (that's a lot of grits.) I kind of want to tell everyone this place sucks just so there's more for me.",4
"Ok I thought this place was good, but I just saw on the News that this place was closed down by the Southern Nevada Health District Today.  Cockroach all over the kitchen and spoiled food were found .... yukkkk guess I won't be eating here ever again",0
"I definitely recommend this place to all burger lovers. The service was fast and friendly. Burgers were the juiciest I've had in a while. The fries were meh, but I think that's been said. A great hidden find, look forward to going back soon.",3
"I purchased a coat online and was a little disappointed with the fit when it arrived. I took it to Ale Maria's and she made it fabulous! She also adjusted some of my husband suits, giving them new life. She has a genuine love for what she does, and I am sure you fellow yelpers WILL NOT go anywhere else once you give Maria a try.",4
"I've been here a few times since opening.  The guacamole is good but I have to say I've had the Chicken Soup and that's what brings me back. Simple but AMAZING!! Sit at the bar, have a happy hour drink but be sure to try the BEST soup ever!!",4
"Gorganzola topped lamb chops with sauteed spinach on the side!! Most amazing thing ever! I would choose this as my last meal if I ever had to have one, haha, great food and good service almost every time I have gone. Also you cant really beat the prices for the wine",4
"Best Bang for Your Buck...Period! I don't know about any hamsters, I do know that I experienced a great night of Real Legitimate Comedy. Our service was stellar, the waitress was on top of her game. She was always around yet not intrusive, pleasant, and most importantly accommodating. Howard Hughes took great care of us before and after the show. Vince Morris Crushed it as a headliner...#WheresYourMamaFrom. My Super Awesome Wife and I will be back again and again! She reported the restrooms were clean and adequate for the venue. 2 thumbs up!",4
"So this little truck is always at the ASU block party on Wednesdays and every Wednesday my friend and I make the plan of eating at one truck and then coming here to get pies for home. And every week we get so full from eating at the other truck that we never end up coming here. Well, last week I decided to break our mold. I ordered my food, and while I was waiting marched straight over to Mamma Toledos to get my togo pies. About 2 minutes later, pies acquired. \n\nNow, i understand that these are mini versions of the ones sold on her website (?). In any case, at $5.99, theyre a steal.\n\nI got the coconut cream for my husband and the strawberry cheesecake for myself. My husband LOVED his. I got much praise for bringing him home such a delicious treat. I was a large fan of my cheesecake as well. It was creamy and delicious, and the crust was just the right thickness and crumbliness. Even 3 days later, still delicious.\n\nTake my advice. Get this before you decide on another truck (either at ASU or FTF), or whenever you see her out. You wont be sorry.",4
"Up until this point, I had lived 26 years without ever trying Scandinavian food. It wasn't until this past weekend that I ventured out and tried something different. Beaver Choice, as the reviews suggest, definitely didn't dissapoint. I took a chance on the schnitzel and fell in love immediately. My girlfriend, ordered the meatballs and also loved it. Without a doubt, this place has great food at reasonable prices.\n\nIf you're looking for something different I highly recommend Beaver Choice.",4
This 3 star rating is for the food.  The food is OK here but when you combine it with the cheap price it is worth going.  I probably eat here a couple times a month.  Its good cheap eats!,2
"My whole family probably get their hair cut here. Wendy is the person you need to look for. Any hair style, combover, punky, spikey, long hair, whatsoever. She does all of them. She's been my hair dresser for the past 7 years till now. Never let anyone touch my hair. Guaranteed trusted and will recommend to everyone!!! Bring a picture too and she can do it. Done it to my son and now he has combovers lol really chill place and friendly atmosphere. Walk-in is welcome too. A+!!!",4
"(3.5 stars really) Came here for a late lunch last Friday with my sister after we checked in to our room at the Palm Place because we had a dining credit there with our stay. We came around 3/330 ish which apparently is an off time for them because their menu was extremely limited. 3 appetizers, a couple salads, a trip tip dip sandwich, and a blue cheese burger were our only options other then sushi which neither my sister or I eat. We were a little taken aback by the lack of options and not drawn to much of any of them, but we were STARVING so my sister settled on the tri-tip dip and I the bleu cheese burger, both are served with fries. \n\nAfter waiting forever when there were only 2 other people who ordered ahead of us we were served. My burger was divine though the bread a bit overly toasted. My sister's sandwich was served on the hardest toasted baguette known to man she could barely cut it with a knife and ended up just eating the meat and cheese out of it. The fries were really different and delicous...like a cross between Rally's(Checker's) and Mickey D's fries. \n\nIf I was offered free food there again I would definitely eat there otherwise not so much.",2
"Only thing worse than the food was the service, worst waitress ever! Not sure what crawled up her butt? She needs to find a new career out of the service industry, maybe a government job.",0
"This place is fun. I gave it an extra star because its next to the Liberace museum. Any place located to close to Liberace MUST be fantastic right? Right. I guess. In any case, the food was just okay, but the portions were pretty ginormous, and the price was right. The joint is off strip, which was a nice change, becuase its relatively peaceful there and the diners all seemed to be locals, except us. And trust, we did stand out. The ambiance is fun with differently themed and decorated rooms depending on your occasion and the bar there is dark as any other in Sin City, but slightly divier. Service was good, albeit a little slow, and all in all the meal was a success. A little wine never hurt anyone.",3
"This is a great, hidden, secret on the strip.  Clean, large, modern rooms with excellent bathrooms!  Great little caf\u00e9 in the lobby and close proximity to everything on the Strip.  \n\nNice, decent pool scene.  I really liked the cocktails. I would recommend staying here.  Compares well to what you get for your money at Aria.",3
"First time here. We tried it on a Sunday so we couldn't take advantage of the Happy Hour deals but it looked like they off $2 beers. \nThe place has some indoor and outdoor seating as well. Kind of a surfer theme. You order and pay at the counter and take number with you. Your server brings your meals to your table but you get your own plastic silverware and napkins, etc.\nThey had a couple vegetarian items on the menu. Nothing tasted bad, but I wasn't impressed. The ceviche and chips tasted good, but it was basically red onion, cucumber, and shrimp cocktail diced finely.  The best part was the red sauce it came with. The bean and cheese burrito was so gooey it oozed out of the tortilla making it very messy to eat. The veggie taco was onions, guacamole, and lettuce. When you looked inside it resembled grass clippings. \nLike I said, nothing tasted bad, and I appreciate that they don't cook with lard, but I really wasn't impressed.",1
"The previous reviewers got it right:\n\n5 Star Dessert Bar:  The hand scooped ice cream is out of this world.  The pies and pastries are awesome.\n\n4 Star BBQ Station:  Very good beef and turkey sliced to order.\n\n3 Star everything else.  The Italian, Asian, International, American, Sushi,and Salad bars were all average at best.",2
"mmmmmm....yummy. I had the raspberry french toast, so good. Portion was not huge, but I was full by the end of the meal. Husband had a southwest skillet, generous and tasty. Word of warning, the coffee is $4.00- we drank four cups each which I think makes it worthwhile. Server was pleasant, and the patrons eating there were nice, even making suggestions as to there favorites on the menu. Will definitely return for more yummy french toast.",3
"Went there for lunch, contrary to other reviews, the place was packed !!!\nOur waitress was overwhelmed but still pleasant, it took 45 min to get our burgers. Tasted ok (I had the Dallas), fries were disapointing. The place seemed understaffed, our waitress had to tend to the cash while trying to get customer orders to the tables. Also the fact that the kitchen is in the basement might explain why it takes so long to get your food...!!!\nWill not be going back, no way !!!",1
"Wow - This place is AWESOME!!! The combo pan roast is hands down the best tasting dish I have ever eaten. No kidding. We have been coming back to this restaurant for several years now, and I am never disappointed. It is worth the wait, believe me. The portions are very large, and the chef cooks the food right in front of you, which is fun to watch. While we are waiting in line, we chat with others who also say they come back to this place every time they can. I wish more than anything I could make this at home, but there is something about the secret sauce and the method of cooking (steam filled pipes) that does it right. I HIGHLY recommend this place - even if you don't gamble or stay here; it is worth the trip. Delicious!!!!!!",4
"So I've been to three of these (downtown Phoenix, Scottsdale and this one in Tempe).  It's basically Irish Hooters without the pantyhose.  The food is decent, if you're there get the Irish nachos because they're always a hit (fresh potato chips + ground sausage / cheese sauce / fresh tomatoes).  I just feel like here, more so than any Hooters or Twin Peaks I've been to, the girls aren't particularly friendly or attentive.  Of course there are exceptions to the rule, but let's just be honest - most of the time when a group decides to come here it's for the scenery.  Flirty and friendly behavior will almost always equal bigger tips - but I feel like here more than the other boobie themed joints the girls / management don't get that concept.  If you're here for a sporting event, you can get a giant tower of beer that they bring to the table and that's actually pretty cool.  I suppose what I am saying is, I don't like it when places half ass their concept.  If you're going to have scantily clad ladies serving food and drink, they should make an effort to entice you to come back - rather than remind you that they're all aware how attractive and unattainable they are.",2
"Used all my m and g dollars here last semester.  Very convenient. Fast good quality service, seems to be family owned. They are very cooperative always give me extra rice instead of the veggies. Best menu items are the same chicken and orange chicken. If u live in taylor place great alternative to dining hall food.",3
"Don't waste ur time and money here !!! The food is very greasy and nothing so fresh .  You may end up with a bad indigestion so be careful whaf u order. The sides taste outta of a old can so nothing even close to \""home-made\""; first tried salvadorian cuisine in phx and probably last .",0
Okay yes this place is over price but I come to find out that you can actually negotiate with them...petland is worldwide and each are actually private owned. I emailed a petland in texas for a dog and it was way cheaper I mean a lot cheaper than here in vegas and it also came with a better package deal...but if you think of buying in petland try negotiating first...you can actually bring hundreds of dollars down to where it actually suppose to cost....,2
"This is a place where you can come to and don't have to worry about all the Vegas glitz and glamour.  If you are looking for that, there is plenty of it on the strip.  Here you can just be yourself and have fun.  Drinks are cheap, parking lot is huge and free.  Easy to get in and out of and alot of space.  I don't notice any abnormal smells, so I guess since 2009 they cleaned the place up.",3
"Pizza is decent, and it being \""secret' is fun, but it tastes MUCH better if you are drunk.  White pizza was tasty (not the best I've ever had), and the price for a place on the strip is good.  It's open late, which is great for a late night treat, but I wouldn't wait in a huge line for a slice.\n\nIf you want to get a drink here, go with a beer on draft - they even come in a red solo cup!  The box wine is disgusting...but that was my mistake for even ordering it.",2
"I freaking love Taco Bell. \n\nEvery time a cheesy gordita crunch is in my presence, I bust out the kleenex and vaseline.\n\nTHANK GOD FOR TACO BELL!",4
"Clown company. Can't describe it otherwise. An hour late, plus forgot an order? Is it a fluke? You'd hope, but this event happened 3 times in a row. Save yourself some time and pick up your own food or use another company. The sheer rudeness and disconnect from decent customer service is reason enough to look elsewhere. Apparently whenever your order is missing an item it is the restaurant's\nfault. Way to throw your affiliated business under the bus to cover yourself. It's not hard to smell past the BS.\n\n\nWho runs this place? Surprised bigger (or trustworthy) business has not taken you over yet. Your framed website is hysterical -- which makes me to laugh at why I would think our food would come as ordered.  A $10 *credit* on $8 missing food(+tax) means nothing-- we have an upset grumpy hungover woman to feed. Plus who wants to use your unreliable company again?\n\nEntrepreneurs with time on your hands -- please explore las vegas delivery food.",0
"Stayed here over Labor day weekend. I used priceline and got the room for $190/night, which was ok for a 5 star hotel for that weekend. The location is ok if you want to go to the mall but it's too far away from any casinos and from the center of the strip. I didn't like paying $15 per day for the resort fee. We ordered a hamburger with room service and one hamburger ended up costing us $30. There were some weird looking people there and the first night someone pulled the fire alarm and we were ordered to evacuate via the stairs from the 29th floor. Would not really want to stay here again.",2
I don't play golf but had lunch with a friend here.  The grounds and view is breath taking.  Especially this time of year.  We thought the food was so good.  The service was great.  They really care about the customers and made us feel very welcome.  Great place for catching up with an old freind.,3
"Bought our used ford focus here a few months ago and brought it in today for an oil change. Fast, helpful service and they even filled and rotated our tires! We walked over to the biltmore mall while they worked, but I noted the sign that offers their guess the ability to borrow an ipad while they wait. That's pretty cool.",3
"good food but pricey sandwiches. Ordered the large Philly Cheese steak, asked me what i wanted on the sandwich, i asked what comes on it, evidently only meat and cheese. I told them everything, which includes mushrooms, onions and peppers. After getting the bill the mushrooms were a $1 extra which was never said, the sandwich ended up being almost $15. I have had better subs for even less money. Would I go again? not likely. The search for better and less cost continues :)",2
"The employee at this location left me feeling unhappy and dissatisfied. When Seth poured my smoothie into the cup, the level barely came within an inch of the top. \""Excuse me,\"" I said, \""but I can't help but feel a sense of disappointment that the smoothie doesn't fill the cup.\"" His response came in a disgruntled tone:\n\n\""Well, it's not even an inch. If it's more than an inch, then we remake it. That's just something for you to know in the future.\""\n\nThe same message could have been communicated in a much kinder way. Rather than feeling better-informed, Seth ended up making me feel pissed off. I'm generally a fan of Jamba Juice, but I'll hesitate to return to this location.",1
"Friendly staff, competitive prices with the option of membership to save some extra cash, clean establishment with great service! Nicole does a great job. She's quick and makes a painful service go by quickly. Definitely recommend. I drive 30 minutes to just go here!",4
"I had the ceviche with all onions, and my bfs burrito was average at best. Not worth it. Don't go here.",0
"Ahhh, the \""Platinum\"" Hotel...where do I begin? More like bronze, silver, etc...Let me keep this somewhat short and to the point. If you're in town on business, MAYBE try this hotel, but if you're looking for the Vegas experience and want to party and have fun, look elsewhere. \n\nKeep in mind, if you read this, I have been to Vegas to party on numerous occasions and stayed at a plethora of hotels...\n\nLet me list my complaints in order:\n\n-Our room reservation got screwed up- they made us wait 2 hours! Yes 2 hours in the lobby waiting to check in our room. Our 2 bed reserved room had 1 bed- horrible. \n\n-Their customer service at the front desk was ridiculously poor. The lady had an attitude as soon as we got there and even told us, \""this isn't like other Vegas hotels, so if you have more than 2 people staying in this room when we investigate, we WILL charge you per person\"". Investigate?? Who says that? We asked for 2 beds for a total of 4 people and they tripped out. \n\n-The room was decent size compared to those on the strip, but its NOT on the strip so it should be cheaper-duh. Big ugly stain on the carpet, and guess what else- blood on our bed sheets, no joke!!! Blood! Are people being murdered in this place or what? Took them 3 hours to replace the sheets btw. \n\n-Mandatory valet- say no more. Not a huge deal breaker tho.\n-Hair all over the jacuzzi tub-gross\n-No place to grab a cup of coffee unless you walk to the am pm next door.\n-Its literally a 15-20 minute walk to the strip...ugh. \n-There's NO icemakers in this place!! None. The fridge has an \""icemaker\"", but ours was just broken i guess. We had to go lug a bag of ice from the 7-11. \n\nOkay... the good-\n\n-Pool was small, but good enough. \n-Yes, the place is clean (recently built), but the staff makes a point everywhere you go to remind you how snobby and stuck up the hotel is. \n\nOverall, when you stay here, you don't feel like you're in Vegas. Yeah i get it, they want to keep it quiet and modern and boring. Okay. But seriously, the place was rude, really understaffed, and simply below average. Just spend the extra 20 bux a nite and go to Paris, MGM, Mirage, anywhere but here.",1
"it might be the best kept secret of Glendale, but it should remain that way. We expected great service and delicious food. We were dissatisfied!! Why?\n1. No one greeted us when we walked in.\n2. Smells like a goodwill, not a scent of food anywhere.\n3. Very grease ridden tortilla chips.\n4. Sour tasting tamales.\n5. Wait staff unable to rectify a simple issue (with the sour tamales) did not offer to remove from bill & did not offer to bring out something else.\n6. Blamed the customer for complaint! really? ha!\nDon't be fooled. It's really that bad!",0
Haven't gone here in a long time due to the dirty bathroom.  There were ancient cobwebs hanging from the ceiling and it was unkempt and in disrepair.  I felt that if this is how they disregarded the bathroom they most likely disregard everything else.  I won't go back.  The food and the service was good.  But I couldn't get past the other issues. 1of 5 stars for a casual to mid level dining restaurant.,0
"Tuesday Night. Walked in at 830pm, left 945pm. From order to being served 15 min.\n\nThis place is NOT a chain. Support your local Phoenix BBQ restaurants.\n\nOne of the few places in Arizona that serves Beef Ribs. Cannot over-emphasize this point..better than Claim Jumper..not even close. Beef ribs have twice as much meat as pork ribs but are much harder to find in restaurants. \n\nThey smoke all their meat on site and everything is super fresh. Melissa & Sawyer were fabulous and I really appreciated the 10% off for using YELP. \n\nThe only downside is that because we sat close to the chicken rack in the back near the kitchen we wound up smelling like a campfire. However we didnt really notice this until after we left and went back to the outside. \n\nThe cornbread starter and donut pastry ender was absolutely unexpected and refreshing. \n\nBeef Ribs = $22.00\n12. Oz Sirloin = $12.00\n2 Non Alcoholic Drinks\nTotal was $45.00 with 10% off..Extremely reasonable, high quality, totally full.",3
"This is the Streets location closest to my house, but unfortunately it is very hit or miss. A few months ago I ordered a pizza online in the morning for this location and I went to pick it up at around 8:30pm, paid, and proceeded to sit there for about 45 minutes. I set the pizza to be picked up at 8:30.... WTF? Oh, they thought they put in my order but they didn't. Awesome. I do not know why they think I was sitting there.... In addition, I was not given any kind of discount for my trouble. So since then I have gotten take out from them a couple times which has been fairly good. \n\nThen, the BF and I went here the other day and ate in... we experienced TERRIBLE service, and I think it was one of the managers who was serving us... We were not given the complimentary bread.... then I saw that they brought out some fresh bread and I was going to ask for some, but I could not get the waitress to come over to save my life. I gave her eye contact on multiple occasions, but she was busy cleaning all the other tables and ignoring us. Finally, I asked a different waiter for some bread and it was about the same time we got our food. The waitress said that the bread just came out so.... but it didn't! I watched it come out (she put it out) at least 5 minutes earlier. We were sitting right next to it, I don't know why she would lie about that. So the pizza was good, but I had ordered a cup of soup and it was still cold... like it was for sure frozen before coming to our table. I asked for it to be warmed up, so she put it back in the microwave (yum....) and brought it out luke warm. Awesome. Now, I like streets.... this location is just not that great.",1
"Two stars for a well trained staff, \""are you finished enjoying your plate?\"" isn't even uttered by any of the more sophisticated dining establishments in NYC or LA.  But the food was disappointing, considering that they've been written up by the NYT as a must visit restaurant in Madison.  And they've hosted James Beard diners!  \n\nI had several appetizers and a dessert: on the octopus salad, only one piece was cooked correctly, the rest too soggy or chewy.  The seared scallops was the better option, cooked to perfection, but the eggplant puree and chutney were rather unneccessary accompaniments - that could be the purist in me.  The cauliflower soup was nice, balanced w/ roasted apples.   \n\nThe homemade watermelon-basil sorbet had an extremely inconsistent texture...was this deliberate?  were the differently sized ice chunks amidst the sorbet supposed to convince me that it was really home made?   I worried initially that the basil might be hidden in the watermelon, but quite the opposite was true - the watermelon was completely lost in the syrupy sweetness of the basil.  If fresh basil was actually used, there was a very heavy hand w/ the sugar.  \n\nA restaurant that posts the accolades that Harvest posts on their website should be able to maintain and live up to their standards.  This is definitely not a must visit restaurant in Madison in my book.",1
"Amazing food. Poor service.  Every time I go to this one it seems I get the worst service ever.  Flat out - the food is amazing and you get served so much you don't need to eat for the rest of the day - but the service sucks .. these guys need a lesson in taking care of people, or hiring more competent staff.",2
"We were just in Vegas and saw 4 shows: Mystere, Le Reve, O and Criss Angel-Believe. While theatrically beautiful and some amazing moments, it's definitely not all that it's hyped up to be. Way too expensive to make it worth it and a lot of boring moments. Mystere was by far the best! Maybe not the most theatrically intricate etc, but definitely the most entertaining.",2
My visit was absolutely terrible! The restaurant had a wait and we were offered bar table seating. The waiter was extremely rude and seemed inconvenienced by my request to clean the table. I stood there 5 minutes until he even came over. After he cleaned the table he did not offer anything to drink. He simply walked away. My wife went to the restroom and her stall was completely out of toilet paper and the bathroom was a mess. My wife let the manager know but he didn't seem to care or apologize. As I waited for my wife all I can hear is the terrible waiter screaming across the bar to another waitress. Unprofessional. After 10 minutes of being ignored we decided to leave. I approached the same manager and let him know how disappointed I was in the experience. He didn't even seem to care. Not much customer service. Sad....this town lives off of service.,0
"Don't be confused by the 'Performing Arts' name; this is another large, soulless concert hall. \n\nI attended the Chinese New Year celebration here which inexplicably included Kanye West, Gnarls Barkley (Cee lo Green and Danger Mouse), Lupe Fiasco, Spank Rock, and Girl Talk (who was booed/jeered off by a visibly angry crowd and never returned [he was supposed to MC in between sets]) in a two-day 'festival' they called Fusion. The other night, which I did not attended, included Jackie Chan (yes, singing) and other presumably Chinese stars that I had no interest in watching. \n\nThe venue is fairly ordinary. Sound is just okay. Significant walk from wherever you park, but it is probably smartest to park at the Cosmo unless you want to be stuck in the PH parking garage all night. - E",2
"Stale, gross, awful food.\nThe fish was stale plain and simple, it was like the sushi you'd find in a grocery store but more stale and dry. I had the tuna and the salmon and it was terrible, had no flavor, no quality, just cheap generic sushi.\n\nThere is little variety, its the same 4 or 5 little rolls rolling around ever 2 minutes, and it gets boring real fast. \n\nThe tempura was awful, it was a weird mix of fried bell peppers, those rip off slivers of potatos, and a few dry broccoli, one of the worst tempuras I have ever had.\n\nThe real put off for me was the big open glass to the kitchen. You can see the guys in the back just standing around talking to each other, barely working, just taking their sweet time and not putting on any effort or charisma. They also stare at you if you are sitting nearby, that uncomfortable kind of \""what you want to eat next\"" kind of stare...you know? Arms crossed, standing stiff, no smiles, nothing, just awkward waiting around you to grab one so they can remake it. I was very uncomfortable and even wanted to move because of it, I hate people staring at me when I EAT!\n\nThe decoration and atmosphere is ugly, like 70's ugly. Avocado green and orange colors, cheap awful furniture, and that whole 70's look which is just unattractive.\n\nI gave it a try but it was just bad, like cheap dollar store bad. Really.\nI have had bad sushi and sashimi before, I've even had chinese buffet sushi, and this was pretty much the same thing but dryer.\n\nIf you appreciate good seafood and tasty sushi, you will be sorely dissapointed by this place. Go elsewhere, seriously. In terms of quality and taste, this place is a drive through, other places like blue wasabi or mikado are a real dining experience.",0
This place was excellent. We were a little nervous because it is in a truck stop but the food was absolutely delicious and the service was fast and friendly.,4
"This place is the best American buffet in the phoenix area.  The quality of food you get here is comparable to good wedding food, fathers/mothers day buffet, or other banquet type events.  All this for only $15 which includes a drink and a wide selection of desserts.  \n\nI go here once a month and the staff is always friendly and very  professional\n\n*insider tip: mention you are a culinary club member and they will give you an additional 20% off.",4
"never heard of it before.  our bachelorette party organizer booked it.  i was skeptical about the smoke-free, gamble-free hotel but it's a PLUS PLUS PLUS for me cuz you don't have to worry about your room smelling funny.  \n\nWOW...i was impressed!!  =D  nice decor, HUGE ROOMS, full kitchen (can chill wine and food in the fridge).  we were also fortunate to have a balcony with a view!  \n\nthere's a full pullout bed sofa in the living room.  facilities are wonderful.\n\nthe only bad thing was the restaurant on the 5th(?) floor.  they were understaffed (although there were two people at the front doing nothing).  kitchen and service was slow.\n\nbut i would totally recommend this hotel!!!  =)",3
"On vacation in Phoenix and was craving some Pho before flying back home and lemme tell you....this place is awful! I wasn't planning to yelp about it,  but it's so bad I must.\n\nThe pho's broth didn't taste fresh and wasn't hot enough to cook the noodles. The noodles were hard and the beef tasted off. The broth looked cloudy... which I hope is from the mix of ingredients? (Sigh) I couldn't even finish a quarter of the bowl. My boyfriend ordered a Vermicelli dish, and the noodles were also hard....why?? It's so simple....you leave the noodles in boiling water long enough for it to soften then take it out to serve! The pork for the vermicelli was decent and that's all I could eat. I hate wasting food, but I left the restaurant with my food literally untouched....and I tried really hard to eat half!  If they can just cook the noodles right, it's the least they can do for improvement.  Don't think I'll be coming back on my next visit so....Au revoir!",0
Definitely one of my new favorite spots. I ordered a stawberry/banana/coconut water + energy boost smoothie and a turkey sandwich on ciabatta bread.  I was super impressed all for just $10. Legit food/drink + friendly service makes this place a winner,4
"My son gets a donut reward for making it thru church.  He is three so sometimes lovin Jesus just isn't enough.  I thought their selection was limited and sooooo picked over.  The donuts we did get were poor quality for the price, stingy on the icing come on.  We need to find a better local place.",0
"First let me stress, this is a place to play games! They are uninterested in giving quick, adequate service. I have given this place several chances...I've been there five times before writing this. I am now convinced that the owner hired his gaming buddies and did not actually hire bartenders..most look pathetically helpless behind the bar and are unable to answer basic questions as \""what beers are on tap?\"" I've waited about an average of twenty minutes standing at the bar while they are 1/4 full to have my tab closed out, each time being reassured that \""this never happens. I've received better service from more crowded bars on mill and I can honestly say that this place has consistently given me terrible service over several visits.",0
Slowest car wash in town.   No idea how cars that come in after mine are done and dry before mine is even through the wash tunnel \n\n\nThe employees here are clueless,0
"I visited Valley ENT, Dr. James Chuang. \n\nPositive: Office is clean and new, wait time was reasonable, got in to see the Audiologist for me hearing test. She was very knowledgeable and up to that point everything was fine.\n\nI meet Dr. Chuang, and he seems to be a sharp Physician with excellent knowledge of Tinnitus, which I suffer from. We begin talking about solutions, and he offers to have me visit their hearing aid in-house service, even though I am \""borderline\"" for the hearing aid. Mentions it no less than three times - which i finally said \""no,\"" I don't want to go that far just yet. I show medical records of my treatment from my past, we agreed to prescribe Xanax for now and the follow up in 6 months. \n\nI verify with Virginia, the MA that appointments are scheduled and medicines sent to my pharmacy. Everything is GREAT!\n\nGet to my pharmacy, no record of any call-ins. Next day, call to inquire - Doctor changed from Xanax to an OTC medicine, which we specifically discussed I had tried and didn't work. On the phone, Doctor makes a THIRD change from OTC to Klonopin, which I've also used to little / no effect. Dr. Chuang tells me through Virginia (MA) that Dr. Chuang is \""sorry for the confusion,\"" but he won't prescribe XANAX. I tell her I need to move on then, thanks for your service - and  Virginia goes to talk to Dr. Chuang, coming back in 5 minutes saying \""we can't do that.\"" I cancel all other appointments with them, receive another call 5 minutes later that they wouldn't give me anything (because I canceled all the other services but still requested the Doctor do something short-term to help me.)\n\nSo I ended up with a $135.00 hearing test, and I still have to find a Doctor that can help me. Unbelievably disappointing that Dr. Chuang would agree on the plan, fail to follow though or contact me why he had changed his mind, and instead try to sell me on expensive hearing aids instead of what worked for me. Revoking the prescription for Klonopin at the end was simply throwing salt on the wound, and frankly childish.",0
"I purchased 2 suits at 650.00 dollars. Two weeks later the same two suits end up going on sale for 400.00. I asked if they will let me return and repurchase under the new sale price to give me some room to buy shirts and ties and was quickly denied. Once they get your money, they don't care about you. I ended up calling another location and the store manager at the east twain location accommodated my request. If you want true customer service, don't come here and go to the east twain location.",0
"Supposedly Elvis themed, but you'd never really know it if you go at night when the lights are dim and the DJs are spinning the same club music you can hear everywhere else on The Strip. \n\nI went here and paid a cover because the bouncers out front told me we could drink for free... but it turned out the deal was only until midnight, and we were entering the lounge at... 11:59. It certainly takes more than a minute to get a drink at a busy Vegas lounge, and we were expecting more than one free drink anyway.  It's the only reason my friends and I paid the cover charge. That being said, I went out and chatted with the bouncers about the situation, and they gave us two free drink tickets each, which fixed the situation for us.\n\nI'd say this place is probably worth visiting during the day, when you can actually see the detailing of the place, which is based on Graceland and features pictures of The King hanging on the walls, and when you won't be paying a cover charge to get in. Not sure what will happen to this spot in the future now that Viva Elvis has closed permanently. Hopefully they'll keep the theme.",2
"30 dollars for lunch!!!!!\n\nMy husband and I came in for lunch and ordered from the lunch menu, even pointed it out on the menu. Waitress came back to get our order again. The menus were gone, she had taken them but we repeated our order. We ate, the food was good...but when we got the bill she had given us regular prices rather than the lunch specials we had ordered. We pointed it out to her her mistake, she then told us WE should have been clear we wanted the lunch special. That we got more food than the lunch special and we had to pay it. She refused to give us the lunch special prices, making our bill almost double. And then had the nerve to tell us that the next time to be very specific and to remeber that the wings are 35 cents on tuesdays. I paid it, but she got no tip and they lost a customer...",0
"Jolta Java. I've had you on my radar for a few months. I remember stopping by once a few years ago and had a pleasant experience. This time... Not so much.\n\nThe coffee drink I got was tasty, and I'm very happy that they carry both almond milk AND soy milk for us lactose intolerant folk. This is where my happiness ends.\n\nThis place needs a SERIOUS deep clean. The floor was covered in crumbs, the tables were littered with debris of various food and paper products. The fake plants were dusty and if you look up to their massive ceiling, all the huge pipes are COVERED in dust. It's an asthmatic nightmare. People would finish their beverage or food and then the table wouldn't be cleaned for a minimum of ten minutes.\n\nThe staff were completely apathetic to all of this. It wasn't busy, so they stood around behind the counter either looking at their cellphones, chit chatting, or watching the Olympics. Sad customer service. \n\nThe more I type out, the more I realize that this shop needs more than a cleaning. It needs an attitude and staff adjustment. \n\nI doubt I'll return.",1
"I cannot handle buffets because I get full so quickly but this place was good. My favorites were the individual little pasta trays. Actually I think that was it. Nothing else really sticks out in my mind. The pork buns were just okay, the sushi was not very good. I couldn't try the desserts because I was too full... I think I still like the Wynn buffet the best!",2
"First time here and was very pleasantly surprised. Lo mein & shrimp pad Thai were delicious. Not overly saucy, salty, or greasy like some Chinese can be. Very fresh ingredients. Friendly & fast service & prices are great!",3
"Not a fan at all of this place. Sure I'm biased as I grew up in New England, but seriously this is just terrible food, terrible service, and really not worth the money. I was trying this place for a second time to give it a fair chance. My fiance and her friend love this place so I went along to give it a second shot. When I pointed out to a friend that was eating the shrimp that if he peeled off the breading and looked at how much shrimp was in there he would be suprised... He did it and just as suspected there was a little piece of shrimp about the size of a maccaroni elbow stuffed into all of that breading. All we could do was laugh... this place is a joke.",0
"Exterior wash: car came out of the washer with soap still on it. Then sat there a while waiting for the wiper people to do their work. One of them did a good job, the other one didn't. Only the good one wiped the inside of the doors. And there was still dirt on the back that I had to go back and clean.",1
"Delicious, but terribly expensive gelato. I'd make comparisons to gelato in Berkeley but that's not fair since everything costs a limb in Vegas.\n\nFor $5.50 you can have one scoop of gelato. Their flavors are great, however, with an abundant variety. Take advantage of the samples to narrow down your choice unless you want to pay nearly $8 for two scoops.\n\nThe staff here could use some cheering up, however, lest  I feel like I'm making their day shitty by ordering a gelato on a hot summer day.\n\n====\n\nRubric: 5 = Mindblowing 4 = Excellent 3 = I see the charm 2 = Disappointing 1 = Never again",2
"The reviews of this place were mixed, but we ordered anyway because we didn't want to leave the hotel. The guy who answered the phone was nice and took our order. The delivery was timely and that guy was also nice. A little spendy for delivery of two philly's and a slice of cheesecake, but everything was really good. We'll probably eat there again before we leave.",2
"Not a good experience.  I'm done with Russian, Kazakh, etc. hair cutters.  They ask how you want it cut & cut it as they want.  I've been to Classic, V's, NY Hair and now this one.  The process is to use a clipper and shear you like a sheep.  I specifically stated I wanted my hair trimmed up and thinned, not cut short.  Short I got.  Ironically I was asked if it had been cut too long!!!  The haircut lasted less than 10 minutes of furious activity.  Not my kind of shop.",0

"Most stressful experience of my Vegas trip!!!\n\nHad reservations to be picked up at 9am.  After waiting outside the hotel for 15 mins we called the company asking where our ride was.  They said they already picked up at our hotel and we weren't there.  I'm a workforce planner who grew up military, \""if you're on time your 5 mins late, if you're 5 mins early you're on time\"".  You can probably imagine my disbelief when they said we were late and it was our fault we missed the shuttle.  We then had to pay to take a taxi to planet hollywood (which we were not reimbursed for), and then mis directed multiple times until we finally found the tour meet up location on our own.  The highlight of the morning was the lady who answered my call at the Hoover Dam Company who kept asking me questions about where I was and then would talk over me every time I tried to answer.  The tour itself was satisfactory, but this poorly run operation had a horrible start which elevated my stress level to an unreasonable level so early in the day.\n\nMy overall recommendation, find a different company to go through or rent a car and drive out on your own.",0
"The Ettrick is... fine.  It has some definite good points as well as definite bad points.\n\nIt has a good beer garden, this is great for those 3.5 sunny/warm days that happen in the summer.  \nIt has (from distant memory) totally reasonable pub food.  It will fill your belly with stodge to soak up the beer.\nIt shows major sporting matches (or at least, it showed the tennis when Andy Murray was playing last year).  This isn't a draw for me, but likely is for some.\n... Ok I can't think of any other good points.\n\nThe bad...\nIt's pretty off the beaten track.  If you want to go anywhere else before or after the Ettrick, be prepared for the longest walk between pubs in all of Scotland (and by that I mean, like, 15 minutes).  \nIt doesn't have the best transport links, so see point above re: how long it will take to get to a reasonable bus stop.\nIt's FULL OF REALLY OLD MEN.\n\nI don't have a problem with old man pubs but this takes it further than I think I'm willint to go.  I'm 29 and I'm pretty sure I was the youngest person there.  Ok yes I'm a child, but probably about 30% of the clientele were in the 70-100 range, 60% were in the 40-70 range, and 10% in the 29-40 range.  \nI'm not even kidding.  \n\nTo be fair, I think there was some kind of old man convention going on or something, as they were all wearing the same tie, but it was a bit excessive.  \n\nIf you must come here, do it during the day when it's quieter.",2
"Sooooo good!  I lived in Italy for a year, and this is pizza the way I remember it.  Fresh ingredients, chewy crust, yummy tomato sauce, not dripping in too much cheese or grease like American style.  Hubby got the Pomo while I got the Principe - ended up eating half each.  Plenty to take home and enjoy tomorrow.  We sat at the pizza bar, so we could watch the cooks.  Our server was attentive and friendly.  The head chef was kind enough to give us a couple shots of limoncello after dinner.  We'll for sure be back.",4
"All i have to say is 1 hour check in. WTF!! The rooms where seemingly old & out dated. For a hotel in Vegas I was expecting a slightly more updated room. Our experience was maybe the worst I have had in any hotel. Again, the checkin was ridiculasly long, and I'm not joking when I said 1 hour!! And this was at 12:15am, on a Tuesday! Then we walked all the way to our room which was about a 10 min walk, with 2 kids mind you. Then we get into our room and just get a wiff of stall cigarette air. We specifically asked for a non smoking of course. So we called the front desk from our nasty room and we were on hold for more than 10 min, after being already frustrated and tired we decided to go to the front desk and go straight to the person and made our statement. We finally got our non smoking room, but also got  very uncomfortable beds. I could go on and on, but let's leave it at that. If you don't believe me just try to experince it yourself and you'll see. \n\nI normally don't write this long of reviews but this 1 just took it! And again, I could go on and on. Bottom line, choose a different hotel if staying in Vegas, The Riviera just didn't cut it.",0

"Worst service ever.\nIf pho kim long wasn't 24 hour and open for me after 4 am, I would've never gone. They do not pay attention to refilling your beverages. The servers inattentive , you might as well just walk out without paying because they just don't care about customer service. \n\nAll I wanted was to eat pho at 5am, but what I got was the worst experience. I waited 20 minutes for my check and ended up going straight to the cashier which was mandated by an arrogant worker who was dressed like he was going to a club. He was so rude asking what I ordered when I clearly did not know the exact numbers for my table. He ended up getting mad at ME because HE couldn't find my check. He couldn't even walk a couple steps for me to show him what table I was at. I honestly wouldve gave this place no stars, but then it wouldn't have let me write a review.",0
"Dirty rooms, old dirty hotel.  Pool was ok.  Shitty elevators, just a cheap all around hotel.  The low price per night and great location give it 2 stars instead of zero.",1
The night staff is super friendly. My co-workers and I enjoy going after work. The breakfast is pretty average and so are the prices. The chicken fingers are average as well. The day staff is a little grumpy but It is our night time in the morning. There are several bars to choose from and this one is not on the top of the list.,2
"Well, it's a ship. Which is a novelty in itself. But you only really need to make this place a stop if you require a beer outdoors at the Shore. They have benches outside that are ideal for a quick beverage in the sunshine. I wouldn't eat here as expensive and have heard it's not very good. But for the benches and banter with pals I'd take a seat!",2
"Tall white guy running the store, implied he was the owner. He did not know what Hoisin sauce was!!!!  We were shocked, which apparently set him off. Was rude, called us a$$holes.  We left our other purchase and walked out. He was so belligerent that I felt physically threatened.  Avoid at all costs!!!",0
"I have been back at a different location. I stumbled on this the first time while I was at a tattoo convention at the hotel. Had heard plenty from friends and various websites that there was something liberating about a straight razor shave. Well they were right. The guy that did my shave, I cannot remember his, an older white haired gentleman. He was just what I would have expected. The only reasons I might have slighted them on the stars was there was very little personality and a bit on the pricey side. But all things said every man should experience the royal treatment at least once. \n\nTry the pre shave oil for your self, it's like going back for the shop shave.",3
"Great dinner date night spot!  Nice modern but cozy spot near pv- we came in at 9 pm reservation but would have been fine not to have a reservation at that time.  We were seated on the far west wall booths- was not too loud in the restaurant as it was not very busy.\n\nI had the Blanche royale margarita which is the house blood orange margarita with Chambord and the hubs had a beer.  Once he tried my margarita he said he wished he had gotten a marg too! \n\nWe started with the chorizo mushrooms and that was a great bite!! Loved the 6 yummy mushrooms and bread to soak the oil up.  Unfortunately the bread didn't seem fresh. It wasn't crusty or soft- just really tough.  I'd appreciate a lighter toast... Or a grilled rustic bread instead.\n \nWe got the chefs vegetable selection which was delicious- very light and straightforward. Lightly seasoned fresh ingredients included roasted cauliflower, lentils/quinoa, arugula, brocolini, grilled Bok choi, and a raw fennel & apple salad.  The cooked ingredients were delicious but the fennel & apples would have greatly been enhanced with a light vinegarette or perhaps a dressing on the side of the tray. The plain arugula did not annoy me as much but still would have benefitted from a dipping sauce option.\n\nWe also had the farm salad I think it was.  I remember the chewy bacon and creamy dressing.\n\nOverall good but not outstanding.  Our server was very nice and professional.  We most likely will be back again to sample more menu items.",2
"A coffee shop that isn't Starbucks open late... and it's good? Finally! That is a huge, huge plus.\n\nIf there was an award for overachieving coffee shop of the year, it's this place. Everything looks perfect. A modern combination of wood, concrete, and metal. Almost like a NYC flat/studio. The menu is a chalkboard, and there is a mini \""stage\"" in the corner - presumably for a future indie-style performance.\n\nThe menu is filled with some familiar and some new. I wanted to try everything in one sitting, but that's probably not wise. There are the normal selections of coffees and teas, but wait, there's more! Pistachio lattes, juices, lemonades, and small pastries make it to the menu, too. Oh yeah, and an Asian favorite - honey toast. Like I said, some familiar and some new.\n\nWhat's really refreshing here is the combination of service and presentation with equally as important quality in products. Everyone is kind and knowledgeable, bringing your items personally to your table. Presentation is spot on with little tea pots above tea warmers served with tiny Bodum-style glasses so your tea stays warmer and is easier to hold.  Coffee is served in large mugs, as you'd expect. Quality of their tea and ingredients is where it should be. Between the pistachio latte, earl gray tea, and matcha green tea frappe - all were great. Even indulged in a slice of cake which certainly did not let me down. No surprises, and that's a good thing. \n\nThis is one of my favorite coffee shops now, easily. Especially that it's open late. Angels were singing the moment I read they were open til 2. Why don't more places capitalize on this need? Anyway, Serenade. Do it.",3
"It's pretty good but I'd have to say that the prices are a little steep for what you get. Had the all american and it was a very good burger. Don't know if it was 15 dollar good, but good. The fries were ok, but not fabulous. Tried someone's onion ring and it was DELISH. Next time would go for those. Dining companion also had the kobe beef burger which was divine according to her - didn't get a chance to taste. Saw decadent looking shakes.....yum. Thought about the foie but was happy I didn't get it  - I was plenty full....",2

"First of all, this puddle in no way resembles a lake, or a squirrel for that matter. False advertising!!! shame on you park people....for shame.

If you're gonna bring gross little kids here to get snot and cheese doodle powder all over the swings it seems like the perfect place for that.. If you are looking for nature go elsewhere.

"Not only was I impressed and wowed by the sale that belk was having on January 25, but I was impressed with the nice lady that took her time to help me find the perfect shirt, tie, and socks for a funeral I attended that same day. Her name was Arlette, she had the perfect style for me and found a terrific fit in just 5 min!!! Not only did she help me get the best possible deal, but because I was pressed for time she even took my shirt and PRESSED IT for me. World class service in a mediocre department store is what will keep me coming back to Belk's. This woman deserves a merit. Thank you and best wishes to your store and team throughout the year.",4

"I give it four stars bc they held my reservation even after I was over an hour and a half late, and they did not rush us out, look at us with disdain, or act nasty to us, which I totally expected. \n\nMe and the mrs ordered the price fixe dinner for two which was around $200, which was pretty much on par with mostof our nonbuffet vegas meals. I think it was some type of surf and turf dish. Our waitress was wonderful in bringing it allout to us. The meal was topped off with a chocolate stratosphere tower. \n\nAnd of course there's the view, absolutely exquisite, and after about 20 mins I stopped noticing the tower rotations.\n\nAnyways, the whole point of this review was to praise how they held our reservation for so long, even after the people ahead of us just showed up reservationless and had an hour wait on their hands. To that, I was very impressed.",3
They came to our home at least 20 minutes late. The woman was rude to my wife who has MS  and just complained until she was thrown out.. we have someone come in monthly to do s cleaning because of this. Almost had to call the police to do it!!!,0
"Polished came highly recommended to me by one of the girls I work with and as I've been searching for a regular place to get my nails done, I was very excited to check it out.  \n\nThe salon is very pretty, lots of pedicure and manicure stations. I booked a spa pedicure and a gel manicure.  The girl gave me a good pedicure, a week later my polish still looks great even if my heels are looking a little ragged but that's more my fault since they were in pretty bad shape when I went in.  My gel manicure on the other hand...when I left the salon I wasn't sure if she had got close enough to the cuticle with the polish since I could already see white but I figured it would be fine.  The color also showed since variance in color across the nail almost a gradient look but I thought it might just be the type of polish (Elite something).  This was Thursday.  Saturday night  the polish chipped on my middle finger.  Grrr, but it happens.  I worked all day Sunday but went in there first thing Monday morning to have it fixed.  They guarantee their work for a week so another girl sands off my polish and redoes my nail.  Cue today (1 week later) after taking a shower I notice the polish chipped off my middle finger, AGAIN as well as my index finger.  30 minutes later I notice the gel on my thumb nail is peeling off.  Not happy at all.  My $40 gel manicure is supposed to last for 2-3 weeks?  Not so much.  \n\nI might go back for a pedicure but definitely will try looking for a new place for my gel manis especially now since it's going into a weekend and I have ragged looking nails.",1
"I decided to try a new place the other day and I happened to stumble across this restaurant. They dont have much on their menu, maybe because they're just starting up or maybe that's just the way they like it. \n\nPrice.. decent. \n\nService... was good. They always came around our table to ask if everything was okay or if we needed anything.\n\nFood.. I had one of their ramens.. it was a bit too salty for me so I didnt end up finishing it. Honestly, I've had better for around the same price but with a bigger bowl, meaning more food. \n\n\n\nAll in all, the experience was okay. But It's definitely not a restaurant that I would ever go back to. There's really nothing special there that makes my mouth water .. and there really isnt a dish that they serve that other japanese restaurants dont already serve (especially when other restaurants serve in bigger portions, better quality, etc)...",2

"Grand Lux is a solid place to eat.  The service sometimes lacks but it is made with the food that you get.  The portions are big and I have yet to have a bad experience with the quality.  Now it is more of a casual place to eat considering it is in the Palazzo and they have a bevy of high quality places to eat.  So if you wanted a high end place, take it somewhere else in the Venetian or Palazzo but if you want something to cater to a lot of people with different tastes and what not you can take them here and they will find something to their liking.  The menu goes from Asian to Italian to your regular meat and potatoes.  So if you are in the mood for something that you can't exactly put your finger on, stop by here and I'm sure you find it.",2
This pub is in a great location but the food is average although to be fair it charges average prices.\n\nNice beer garden for a sunny day,2

"Would have given it one star if it weren't for Calvin Harris and my friends. I was on a highly respected persons guest list for wet republic and when we got there we walked up to some goon worker to ask where the guest list line was, and he dismisses us, didn't look at us and said \""it closed at 2\""  and i said \""its 5 minutes after 2\"" and this loser mocked me and and talked in a girl voice and said \""Oh! I didn't know that omg!!\""  Really loser? I told him whose list i was on and he pretended to not know who he was. It's my 25th birthday and I'm here with 5 beautiful women and this is how you treat your guests? So i called my contact and he told me to go straight in, to which the same loser employee would not let us go!! We ended up waiting two hours in line and had to pay a ridiculous price , and only saw calvin for 30 minutes. Every person who worked there was so rude. I had a horrible experience. Will never go back there. The pool is filthy, the drinks are overpriced, and i would over look all of that but i will not overlook rude disgusting employees. I am so polite and they made sure my birthday was horrible. If i spent all that money, i better be treated well. And i wasn't. Too bad.",1
"The food is more for looks. It's great for taking pictures and adding to Facebook, but the food lacks sooooo much flavor.",2
"I often used to come to Oyshi because it's close to my house and it was very delicious. Fish was always fresh and service was always good, but ever since they got popular, everything has down-graded. \n\nI tried to give them second chances because I used to love this place so much! But lately, their customer service has been way too slow. I get that they're busy, which IMO they need to hire more staffs. My last visit, it took them at least 10 mins to realize that we were standing there waiting to be seated. Then, it took 30 mins for the server to bring us water and miso soup. The owner walks by and doesn't acknowledge us at all. You've got to be fast and efficient, especially a busy place like this, you've got to have more staffs. I will never come back again, even if it's a block away from my house. \n\nDespite my horrible experience, I still love their Love Affair roll, it's the only roll that doesn't fail to satisfy me.",0

We browsed the candy store while we waited, wasnt too long. I had a bit of a hangover so I wasn't too hungry so I just got some eggs and bacon. But wow the bacon was cut super thick and I could barely finish it! A friend and I were joking that it was bacon on crack and we wondered how big the sausage was.. As we both looked over to the end of the table where another friend had huge sausages! We laughed for a while and no one knew why.. We had never seen breakfast sausage that looked like full on brats! Each pair of girls shared the gigantic goblets of mixed drinks. They pour it over dry ice so it bubbles and fogs the whole time! We got the berry one and it was amazing- but $35 (well, its vegas). When I have a chance to eat here again I'll bring a bigger appetite and try the fried chicken, because we were all eyeing it.",3
"Delicious as usual, but this location is way super packed!  And can be a warzone to exit the parking lot back onto Tropicana.",3
"Always busy which is a good sign that they do a good job at this store considering there are 3 others within a 3 mile radius. Store is always clean, staff is attentive and friendly, and fast. I don't have to repeat myself 50 times with what to put on my sandwiches either which is something I do appreciate. \n\nAll in all a nice place to stop by for lunch on the go!",3
"Exactly what I expected from CPK, inflated prices, similar menu to what they had 5-10 years ago, and no attention to detail.\n\nMy friend started with the wedge salad on the small plates menu. I could see the water dripping off of the lettuce and all the ingredients appeared to be thrown on the plate. Not a good value for almost $6. Next came our entrees, the oriental chicken salad and Hawaiian BBQ chicken pizza. Once again, both dishes did not appear thoughtfully made. My salad contained iceberg lettuce, carrots, cabbage, and chicken the only substantial ingredient. The salad was exactly like a mix from the grocery store. The dressing was fine although a little heavy for the ingredients in the salad. My friend was also underwhelmed with her pizza. Her pizza was soaked in BBQ sauce, it was undercooked, and you could tell the quality of the mozzarella was low by the plastic like texture. \n\nCPK I waited years to give you another try to see if the quality and thoughtfulness of your dishes had improved but I see the price of your food is still too high for the ambiance, quality, and plating of your dishes.",1
Excellent service.  Excellent food. Cozy ambiance. Reasonnable prices.  Will be going back for sure!,3
"A stay that started with friends being able to get the keys before I got there simply by saying they were staying in 924 (and show no ID) and ended with the head of Housekeeping looking at her watch when she stopped by at 12:05 pm checkout day while I was waiting for a friend to bring around the car and would be out in 5-10 minutes.  Don't stay here - they clearly see customers as a (un)necessary evil.\n\nThat said, there were several friendly staffers - Candy (Front Desk), Hope (restaurant), and Saturday's morning shuttle driver and while there, the room was functional, clean and met our needs.\n\nThe stay began 300 miles away when I checked in online via HHonors.com and chose a great room on the top floor and called ahead to add friends to the reservation since they would be arriving earlier than I would.  The first time friends stopped by, the front desk person said they weren't on the reservation.  When they return after I added them, they spoke with a different clerk than they had earlier or I did on the phone - and were given keys without being asked for ID.  That has to be illegal (if not, it should be).\n\nThey go up to the room to find the HVAC unit in pieces unassembled - luckily we had a good weather weekend, but that could be a rough bump in the night going into the grate over the plastic casing of the unit.  As the stay progressed things were relatively uneventful.  The restaurant and shuttle service did an excellent job Saturday making our stay for the Pitt vs. Georgia Tech Football game a good day.  Much appreciation to those named above for making that happen.\n\nThis morning, we had a lot of interaction with the people who run this hotel.  At the restaurant, the Director of Food & Beverage was taking orders for the made-to-order breakfast; of the three of us, the last person's order wasn't included on our ticket.  So, one of the servers took the number from our table making it difficult for them to find us once the third person's food was ready.  So hard in fact, that they gave her food to another table that even said it was what they'd ordered.  This was straightened out eventually, but it is interesting how the staff managed a packed house the day before flawlessly, and today a sparsely filled dining room was tricky for the Director of Food & Beverage to manage.  Most staff was the same - and maybe they were tired - but it really did seem that changing who took the orders may have impacted the accuracy of food delivery.\n\nLastly, at check-out, I was preparing to walk out the door (which had the 'do not disturb' tag on it, and there came a knock and I said I'd be out in 5-10 minutes.  In fairness, it was 12:05.  Another knock came and I opened the door - the Head of Housekeeping was there with her clipboard.  I explained that I was hustling to get ready and would be out in 5-10 - to which she responded \""okay\"" and she looked down at her watch.  When I express dissatisfaction with her attitude, she said \""sorry you feel that way, this room was marked as vacant which is why I checked.\""  To which I responded, please don't apologize for how I feel about something - please apologize for your actions.  I realize this was a bit harsh, but I didn't appreciate that this was the last impression I'd have of this hotel - and she felt it was okay that that impression be a negative one.\n\nHigh potential staff, but management has a lot of improvement needed.  Try the Residence Inn Pittsburgh University instead.",0

Well, today was my first visit to this location of Great Clips, my regular salon chain for haircuts, and here's how it went:\n\n *  I arrived at about 10:30 am on this SUNDAY, & expected the wait I'm accustomed to at 24th St. & Baseline or 7th Av. & Osborne, but I was seen right away!     :-))\n\n*  My Stylist Caila was totally nice, really listened to what I wanted, and also gave me a PERFECT haircut!

"I love this place, no joke.  For years and years I have come to Vegas, and have been missing out.  It's so weird, it's awesome, it was one of the highlights of my trip, no lie. \n\nPeppermill feels like to stepped in a time capsule into a diner with odd waitresses wearing ball gowns.  The food is cheap and very very good.  They are open 24 hours, and have a super cool little lounge that was filmed on Gigolos (If you haven't seen it google, no judgement here :))  We ordered sandwiches all round, with sweet potato fries.  Everything we had was a super large portion and very tasty.  \n\nThe lounge part is my favorite with a big sunken in room with a large fire pit right in the middle.  Drinks are reasonable, and service was fast.  Def. a cool little spot to get your grub on at 3a.m. or romantic spot for drinks.  Loved it!",4
"I really do save my 5s for OUTSTANDING restaurants.  But WCG deserves a 4.7 or so.  Absolutely delicious and I cant wait to try something else.  We skipped appetizers to make sure we had room for dessert.  I got the bacon burger (over the steak sammich) as the waiter said the burgers were great.  And he was right.  Very fresh, nice seer on the outside and perfectly cooked. very fresh and seasoned well.  The mashed potatoes were good as well.  had a bit of a nutmeg/cinnamon thing goin on with it.  Different, but I liked it.\nwife had some type of Salmon.  I hate fish, but I tried it since she was raving about it.  It was actually very good and that pains me to say it.  I would actually order it...(if they ran out of red meat).\n\nThen comes dessert.  Neither of us are bread pudding fans, but the waiter said it was the best.  He was NOT wrong.  Ive never had bread pudding like this before.  it wasnt mushy at all.  it was a hugemongous, dense, amazing, tasty treat.  the vanilla ice cream was a nice touch although it should have had a bit more of that.  \n\nWere goin again this week!",3
"DO NOT BUY A CAR from FOLGER KIA. In march, we bought a Kia sportage for $10500, the top end of the estimated value via Kelly blue book. When I drove the car in April, the AC was not working well. I specifically asked if this car was in good shape and Shamori (the finance manager)  assured me it was. In April we had to replace All 4 tires and the battery at a cost of $700. I gave Shamori a chance to take care of this, he took it to Rick (the general manager) who said no. We are now faced with replacing the AC compressor  - a $1200-$1500 repair. Despite assurances that they would stand by their product, Folger Kia has deliberately decided to not take care of over $2000 worth of repairs I had to make.  DO NOT BUY A CAR from FOLGER KIA.",0
"Hmm... after further review, I feel I need to be more critical. We didn't finish everything last night, so I can back for seconds this evening. Here are the final results:\nThe ribs were so full of fat, they were virtually inedible. It was hard to see all the fat through the dry rub caked on it. Again, no signs of ever having been smoked, either in flavor or color. I actually had a few bites of the ribs and tossed them. If you know me, tossing ribs is sacreligious.\n\nThe brisket sandwich. Brisket? It tastes like the onion strings or rings or whatever they covered all the brisket in. After extracting the layers of fried onion strings, I tried the sandwich again... and guess what folks - the brisket had no flavor. I had to put BBQ saue on the brisket sandwich to get some taste in it.\n\nI'm not sure what Brickhouse is going for here, but it does make me sad to give a bad review. Maybe it was a bad day for them? I'll try again one of these days... but not any time soon.\n\n\nFourteen years ago,  friend and I walked around the downtown Madison area in a fruitless search of anything barbeque... chicken, ribs, riblets, even the fake shit, smoked and slathered in sauce would have sufficed. Anyhow, 14 years later, someone came up with the brilliant idea of opening a barbeque joint on campus. It's a nice looking spot, and it appears to have a variety of different beers and liquors in addition to their BBQ, also nice to see in the campus area. Unfortunately, the BBQ itself was so so. I expected far better, but then again, I've always said that expectation is the king of all let down. The other criticism is that for the campus area, the pricepoint is pretty damn high. I know decent BBQ doesn't come cheap, but you also have to consider your location. If you are wondering, we had the ribs and a brisket sandwich. The ribs were okay, and I didn't see any of the telltale signs of having been smoked. They were chewy, which some people like - I don't. The brisket sandwich was rich and also lacking in flavor. The mac n' cheese was pretty basic - lacking in flavor. The chipotle smoked sweet potato salad was interesting, and the french fries - well how can you screw those up? Those were decent. Service was adequate and there was plenty of seating when we went. If I'm going to drop a couple bucks on BBQ, I'm going to pass on the ambiance of the downtown/campus area, and head over to Smoky Jon's.",1

Good food!  I ordered a chicken lavosh and it came with a bonus side salad.  Despite being packed waiter was attentive.  I would go back!,2
"7/26/12\n\nIf you're looking for atmosphere, you won't find it here.  It's also very loud (I went during lunch hours), and you're most likely going to have to wait, unless you come during the tail-end of lunch.  (There's a sign posted on the wall by the door that stated to the effect that for those customers who did not want to or could not wait, then please visit Narai Thai and Sushi down a few doors.  To some people, it might come off as abrupt, and even slightly rude, but I thought that was generous of Thai House to post...  Both places are good, and Narai Thai has atmosphere.)   What you will find are a great Chicken panang http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/JdtJ3jmMukLXU-gDjVTEgg?select=UMYl4OVwixbiNkHhZM1P2Q#x0sI8WU7hgYveO5nGEFk1A and a terrific bowl of Curry noodles!! http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/JdtJ3jmMukLXU-gDjVTEgg?select=UMYl4OVwixbiNkHhZM1P2Q#RDHeNq9Ld9h5-6imL9WDRg  The curries here are rich and very silky-- just how I prefer them!  The Thai iced tea I had was also very, very good (not too sweet).  What I didn't like was that the lunch specials only featured the entree and your choice of soup/salad and steamed white/fried rice.  No egg roll.  Probably a healthier option, but still... :(  I didn't care for the salad dressing, a sweet vinaigrette.  Next time, I'm going to specify dry.  \n\nWhat really sealed the deal here for me was the service!  I cannot wait to go back and try the other menu items!",3

"Selected Dr Michael Moore because he was in my dental plan and his practice was close to my home. The first phase of my treatment plan was to get 8 crowns across the front top of my mouth. The process took over a month and a half.\n  The dental assistants especially Samantha who supported Dr Mike were awesome and very professional with great personalities. Dental equipment was real high tech stuff.\n  Dr Mike is so calm and reassuring when he speaks with you. I felt confident more than anxious.\n  Now that the 8 crowns are in my mouth, I'm ready to give the experience a thumbs up and recommend people to Dr Mike's practice.",3
"I ate here with my family the other night, 7 of us, for the second time and once again found it to be an exceptional place. With Athena's gone, The Golden Greek in my opinion is the best Greek restaurant in town. Being Greek we don't often go out for Greek, because we can usually get better at home, but TGG is worth going out for. Everything on the menu is solid if not excellent, in our 2 visits we've tried most of the menu. The dishes that stand out the most are the Lamb Shank, it's a special- not sure how often, and the Garithes Yiouvetsi- shrimp baked in tomato sauce w/ feta. I'm not a huge lamb fan ( I never order it, but tasted someone else's in this case), but this shank, slow cooked in a tomato sauce, was wonderfully tender and flavorful, I would go back just for that. The tomato sauce that the shrimp were cooked in was very garlicky and delicious. There were quite a few shrimp in the dish, more then you'd expect for $10.95. The homemade bread is just made for dipping into the leftover tomato sauce. W didn't get dessert this time, but had the rice pudding last time and it was very good as well. Prices are unbelievable as well. Seven of us ate, w/ a couple doggie bags, for $85 including tip, great, great value. One of these days we'll have to try something from the Italian side of the menu. \n\nTip- you can view their whole menu on Idine.com",4
"The owners of light group put together this restaurant in the Mirage and it's almost an identical menu as FIX in the Bellagio. Dinner for 4, 3 cocktails, 3 appetizers, 3 salads, 4 entrees, 2 sides, 2 deserts. $460.\n\nThe waiter suggested I try the Kurabota pork chop. I am a pork snob and I'm obsessed with anything pig. Besides, us Hawaii folks know how to cook up some delicous pork. It tasted like a normal pork chop, that I would've prepared on the grill at the beach. My friend had the surf and turf. That was delicious and my other half had the sea bass with lobster risotto. I'd give that a thumbs down. I didn't particularly care for the risotto swimming in lobster broth. Don't order  the calamari, you can get better calamari at some local dive bar. The popcorn shrimp was alright. The miso cod lettuce wraps were also okay. I loved the truffle fries and the chili cheese fries. I don't get what the big deal is with the jelly stuffed donut holes and the chocolate souflet was a disappointment. Way over priced for small portions and limited imagination.",1
"Super slow service. They have inside and outside seating which is nice. However, they only have two waitresses outside for about 20 tables. They don't take your entire order they only take your drink order and then your good order. It took 10 minutes to get our drink order. After finally getting our drinks she waited another ten minutes to come get our food. When we ordered our food when I asked for light coleslaw she said they can't do that and for me to just take it off. She explained that they just put fistfuls on it. So why can't they just put less fistfuls on it? \n\n\nOur waitress was very rude and didn't make me feel welcomed at all. She never introduced herself and just treated us like animals. \n\nI would never tell anybody to go to the Primanti Brothers again downtown. The one in Oakland is so much nicer and better quality. \n\nIt's really bad management to have only two people serving outside when there are over 20 tables. It's not fair for the customers or for the servers. \n\nWhile the food was good as always it wasn't worth the wait because it just took to long. The service wasn't nice at all and I wouldn't tell anybody to come here when it's crowded.",0

"Would definitely stay here again. Wished we were on a higher floor, but great place to stay. Best part: fantastic, comfortable bed! When we came back at 2am, it was nice to sleep in such a great bed! Loved the rollercoaster and all the great restaurants. The pool was nice and the staff was great! Just wish housekeeping didn't replace the bathroom towels each day as we were trying to be green... ya know conserve water and energy and such!",3
"I was not impressed.  The beer wasn't very good (I tried the amber one, it tasted like the keg lines hadn't been cleaned in a while).  The whole place smells like a fart.  The worst part was that the doormen were really rude.  My wife's id was hole-punched because she is getting a new one because her name is changing.  Even though she is clearly older than 21 (she's 26) they wouldn't let her drink.  Not a huge deal, they were just following the law.  But they proceeded to assign staff to watch us the entire night.  A greasy ogre literally followed us around and watched to make sure she wasn't drinking.",0
Not as good as I remembered. Sent the food back as it tasted off. Pies seemed a bit odd too. Frozen and defrosted? Texture wasnt quite right.,2
"Hoping to come to canyon ranch for fresh delicious food. Didn't work out as planned. For starters I ordered the arugula/spinach salad with salmon. They slopped some wilted, yellow greens on a plate and topped it with a fishy tasting salmon. Not very good at all. Edamame was totally undercooked also. My husband got the veggie stir fry with chicken. Once again it was as if they threw the food onto the plate without any consideration for presentation. So sloppy. \n\nService was terrible as well. The woman worked very hard but was so unfriendly and unwelcoming. Very slow and forgot an addition to salad\n\n\nLastly, the decor was so dated.  No inspiration at all. Especially for a spa. Very tired. Would not recommend at all.",1
The restaurant looks great from the outside and has a good ambiance and this is all a cover up for bad food and bad service.\nWe sat at the bar and waited for a drink. The bartenders looked us straight in the eye and never acknowledged we were there. We had to ask for a drink.  That was a long agonizing process.\nWe told the hostess we would like a table. She said she would let us know when one came available. We waited and watched her seat others. She forgot.\nThen when we finally got seated we waited again for almost 20 more minutes and once again we had to ask for a waitress to take out order.\nMind you..the waitresses walked past us at least a dozen times and didnt even acknowledge us. \nThen we ordered out food (two burgers)..that was another wait an we had to ask the waitress to check on our order. Food finally came and the burgers were similar to something I could have gotten at the Burger King drive thru! We asked for medium rare and we were presented with these well done hockey pucks! \nReally...nothing good to say about the experience.,0
Beautiful salad bar but this location has NO MEAT.....great for vegetarians but if I'm eating a salad for a meal then give me some protein.....PLEASE....first and last time here!!,0
"Note: I only give out 5 stars to surprisingly EXCEPTIONAL, best-in-class establishments.\n\nSUMMARY:  This restaurant can be summed up with a simple statement: interesting concept, horrible execution.  \nSave your money.  There are tons of wonderful restaurants & interesting eateries in Las Vegas.  With such strong competition, you don't need to waste your time in a place like Brooklyn Bowl--the food is reasonably tasty, but not worth the absolutely horrible service.  This is not the kind of restaurant you want to take your family to espescially if you have small kids--it's amazingly loud, and you will have to shout somewhat to talk to one another.  The ONLY reason I didn't give this place 1 star: the manager who at least attempted to salvage the situation.\n\nMy brother-in-law serves in the Navy in Marlyand.  His wife is temporarily living in Las Vegas with thier 7-month-old daughter so she can finish the internship requirement of her photography degree.  As a surprise birthday present to his wife, my in-laws arranged to have their son flown in for a little less than a week so they can spend time together.  When she walked onto the High Roller, she had no idea that her husband would be arriving to surprise her; it was a wonderful time on the 30-minute ride with her husband, daughter, mother, father-in-law, mother-in-law, sister-in-law (my wife), niece (my 3-week-old daughter) and me.  After our fun ride, we had a 7 PM reservation for a meal at Brooklyn Bowl.  Or so we thought.\n\nUpon our arrival, the two very rude hostesses kept asserting that they didn't have our reservation, despite the printed reservaton confirmation we provided.  Frankly, I don't care whether The Linq concierge failed to transmit the reservation to Brooklyn Bowl or whether someone at Brooklyn Bowl failed to input the reservation into their system.  I don't care whose fault it is because I know one absolute thing--IT ISN'T OUR FAULT.  After pressing the issue with the manager and Concierge for over 15 minutes, the seven of us (a friend joined us after the ride on the High Roller) with two chidren in tow were finally crammed into one booth.  I asked if we could be seated at the vacant table next to us, but the hostess said it was reserved for another party.  Then she rudely added, \""Just like the table we're giving to your party.\""  I felt like defending our position as their customers (who had placed a reservation, confirmed by our printout), but I figured, why fight with someone who barely makes more than minimum wage?  I've got better things to do & accomplish in life.\n\nI hoped that our waiter would finally provide a semblance of good service.  To be completely honest, he was accommodating and friendly.  However, at best, the wait staff were quite absent-minded.  Food orders arrived incomplete.  Drinks took quite a while to be refilled.  (It's 100 degrees outside, the food is very salty and the glasses aren't very large... safe to say, a waiter's got to work to keep those glasses filled!)  The food was average; I ordered the fried chicken dinner, and while it was reasonably tasty, the chicken was overcooked so the coating tasted slightly burned.  \n\nThe manager was kind enough to provide our party with desserts on the house for the oversight  & trouble regarding our reservation, and the poor service we received before being seated.  I thought, \""Now THIS guy knows how to treat a customer... that must be one reason why he's a manager.\""  We ordered desserts to go, since the kids started to get fussy.  When they arrived, we found that we were missing some desserts.  Wow, even the \""apology\"" dessert order couldn't be fulfilled properly.  Like I said before, nice concept/idea... horrible execution.  \n\nThere's much more I could explain about the horrible service we received, what I witnessed at the tables around us & what those diners were saying about their waiter(s) and the poor service I witnessed being given by the hostess to other potential diners (some who were unfortunate enough to not have a reservation and were rudely told off).  Frankly, I'm tired of writing.  But take my word for this, poor service is a strong theme in this place, even on a night that wasn't particularly busy.",1
"Gross! I ordered a turkey sandwich. Just awful. The bread was falling apart and hard, the meat tasted terrible, like plain ol' lunch meat. Overpriced and definitely not worth it. Don't waste your time or money!",0
"It's 32 miles roundtrip from my house to Branded Meats but the recommendation of a co-worker made me decide to try them. Big mistake as they are closed on Monday. Why didn't I check? Oh, I did, Yelp listed them as open Monday and under the Google map they are still listed as open on Monday.\n\nSo now another 10 miles out of my way to Whole Foods to buy steaks. As I was leaving another man who had googled them on his iphone came walking up, he did not look happy when I told him. I wonder how many customers they have lost by not paying attention to something so simple.\n\nI did email Branded Beats about this and received a rather lame apology after a few weeks. They had not been open on Mondays for over two years but never bothered to change their listings on Yelp or Google below:\n\nAddress: 1550 W Horizon Ridge Pkwy, Henderson, NV 89012 \nPhone:(702) 492-9998 \nHours: Monday hours 10:00 am-6:30 pm  -  See all\nMonday 10:00 am - 6:30 pm \nTuesday 10:00 am - 6:30 pm \nWednesday 10:00 am - 6:30 pm \nThursday 10:00 am - 6:30 pm \nFriday 10:00 am - 6:30 pm \nSaturday 10:00 am - 6:30 pm \nSunday 12:00-5:00 pm \n\nTransit: Stephanie @ Horizon Ridge (N) \n\nThis debacle makes me wonder about how well they handle all the other aspects of their business, I doubt that I will go back. Think I will stick with Village Meats as I have for the last 35 years; they're closed on Monday as well but it's been posted that way on Yelp and Google.",0
can spend a long time here looking around some days you find something good other days well not so much,3

I ordered 3 Chicken Caesar Wraps to go and guess what??  The 3 sandwiches contained a half leaf of lettuce...BETWEEN THE 3 OF THEM.  When you sell a chicken caesar wrap you are selling a chicken caesar SALAD wrapped in some sort of pita.,0
"Been to this big lots a few times, I recommend It. The pictures they have for sale are always really nice and the service has always been good. They also have some pretty good deals that just can't be beat",3
"Disappointed doesn't begin to explain. I now spent $350 on a bridesmaid dress that will never be worn. It is the wrong size, they won't alter it. They will do nothing and now I do not have a dress to wear at a wedding that is 2 1/2 weeks away. \nHailey the assistant manager is clueless and unhelpful. She knew nothing about the dress which is why it is wrong. So I thought maybe the manager Hannah would help. NOPE. Nothing. They even made the bride call the manufacturer herself, talk about poor customer service.\nI would NEVER recommend Nitsa's. I would even give it one star.",0
"Sort of \""chain-ish\"" but the food we had was pretty good. I liked that the side of beans were fresh (not refried & covered in cheap cheese) and the rice had roasted sweet corn in it (also not smothered in cheap cheese). Overall, enjoyable.",2
"Let me start off by saying they deserve no stars at all!!! \n\nBoyfriend and I waited a few minutes for anyone to even take our order. \n\nI ordered the grilled chicken quesadilla a la carte for $5.44 and an order of monster fries to share for $3.99. Boyfriend ordered the 5 piece buffalo tenders a la carte as well for $6.44. \n\nMy quesadilla was a single soft taco sized tortilla folded in half. Could not even see the cheese from the side. Came with some lettuce and chopped tomatoes with about 6 stale tortilla chips and a blob of sour cream. Chicken was very blah.\n\nMonster fries looked like French fries that had previously been fried then refried to our order. (working in the food industry I am very aware many places will blanch the fries but this was not the case) crunchy oil soaked fries topped in what I believe was chili, 3 jalape\u00f1o slices, about 5 pieces of diced tomato butts and some cheese. Oh almost forgot about the almost non existent bacon bits. \n\nMy boyfriends chicken was drenched in the buffalo sauce and just wasn't very appetizing. He came home and was sick for an hour! \n\nThis was the worst $20 I have ever spent on food!!! We will never be eating here again.",0
"Came here for Thanksgiving dinner and it was terrible. We paid 65 a person plus a mandatory 20% service charge and felt robbed at the end. The food was cold and over salted. The seafood selection was limited to cold shrimp, dry salmon, and awful tasting crap. The turkey was so dry that it crumbled like dry cheese. The prime rib was over cooked and very salted. The side selection was very weak and consisted only of mashed potatoes, sweet potatoes, and some mixed veggies. The desert selection was limited to some terrible pie and chocolate and vanilla pudding. We were very let down and will never return here again.",0
"The two stars are for the fact that my room, while outdated, was very clean. That's the only good thing i have to say about this place. \nI got there at the exact time I was told I could check in. Still, I had to wait an additional hour because my room was not ready. The staff wasnt rude, however, they werent very welcoming either. \nThe biggest bummer was the fact that the sole purpose of my Vegas trip was to drink, party & have a good time. That was not going to happen here. The crowd is an older one. I felt oh-so-very uncomfortable walking from my room to the strip (in my club-ready dress). Almost as if I was afraid to run into my grandmother looking like a.... well, not like the young lady I dress like back at home. Lol! \nAnyway, at the end of the day, I had a clean and comfy room. HOWEVER, I wouldnt be back unless the room was comped, again.  \n\nOH! Check out these pics of the hallway that led to my room....",1
We had a terrible experience at this lunch buffet. The table was not very clean with food in the crevices. The owner assured us that there was plenty of safe food for my son that is allergic to egg and dairy. The tomato soup tasted canned. The vegetarian korma had frozen vegetables. The lentils had kidney beans mixed in which I have never seen at an Indian restaurant before. It all ended with my son puking on the floor. So much for a dairy free meal. Not sure how this place got a four.,0
San Tan is a great spot. Food is good brewery food. I prefer lighter beers so I stick to the Sunspot and Hef and both are great. Love the outside patio here and feels great on warm nights with the misters on. Not the best acoustics inside so it does get a little loud but during dinner time it's not to the point you are shouting. Servers and bartenders are friendly. Looking forward to some good times at San Tan this summer.,3
"Love this place! Visited phoenix in March, had an excellent experience with kids and family. Second visit in July, and another great dining experience. Waiter was extremely courteous, informed us mariachi bands Saturdays @6. I had the steak fajita lunch and hubs had seafood chimi! We will visit again!",3
The smokiness of real wood they use for grilling gives the food an intense natural distinct flavor! These guys know their job! Ming Ming rocks!,4
"The sushi was good (I only tried 2 rolls). The wine selection was GREAT! The service was good, and the price was a bit high. Over all I enjoyed my experience at RA. The only 2 negatives were, the women's bathroom was being remodeled so I had to used the men's....eeeewh, and it was FREEZING! For some reason the AC was on at 8 pm at night and it was cold outside. We asked them to turn it off because it was blowing right on our table and no one ever did. Since I was literally shivering I did not get to enjoy my experience as much as I would have liked. I really just wanted to go relax and chat with my friends after work, but I think I burned just as many calories sitting there freezing my ars off as I would have if I had gone to the gym. I'll go back when it is hot outside again.",2
"Pittaya Lisawasd was my promoter and he did a great job taking care of me and my friend. He walked us in without waiting in line, brought us to a table at great location with tons of free drinks. Total VIP experience and we didn't cost a penny. We will def come back again. Club itself was very nice. I like it better than marquee(dark and dancefloor is smelly w tons of people sweating due to the crowding) or xs(people who work there are kinda snobby) overall my fav club in Vegas hands down! Thanks Pittaya for the great experience.",4
"Heard about this local establishment thanks to my sister who saw a profile of it on some Food Channel show. Stopped in at lunchtime to a full restaurant. My server was great. Wait time was a real pain in the booty though. The burger I had was delicious, but nothing special. It's one of those local places that gets too much hype.",2
"Awful.  Ordered 16\"" pizza and chopped anti-pasto salad.  The Pizza was doughy and the topping just slid off the soggy crust.  Maybe I'm a snob, but in Chicago, pizza restaurants know how to make a good pie.  This was just a waste of $27.00.  2 bites was all that was required to banish this pizza to the streets of New York.  Thats where the garbage is picked up.",0
"If this grocery were not the absolute closest to me I would never ever shop at this particular Walmart. \nEvery single time I go they are out of something I need. Every time. The shelves always seem to need to be stocked. \nThe staff always has this dead behind the eyes look. One time we wanted to spend a good bit of money on a TV. We asked a clerk if they had the one we wanted in the back as we didn't see it on the shelves. He said he would look and never came back. We look around 5 minutes later and he is helping someone else. Needless to say we took our 800.00 and spent it somewhere else. Their loss. If you have a choice to go to another store, then do so.",1
"Nifty enough place.  Selection is surprisingly more limited than you'd think, considering that it's a salad bar only.  I've been in chinese boofays and sizzlers that had just about the same options for salad items.\n\nMeat of any kind is few and far between, but if you're creative you'll find some.\n\nRecommendation is to go when and only if you have a coupon, otherwise it's simply not worth the horrendously over-ambitious price.",2
"not my fav! weird mixture of sit-downy restaurant and bar, with neither being really good.",1
"Doesn't look like much...being in a strip mall but the food is great. We arrived on a week night and there were plenty of seats. The service was good and the food was excellent. I ordered the chicken tacos and they were loaded with plenty of food. Real, authentic Mexican food and for the right price.",3
"I have eaten at many Greek / Mediterranean restaurants around the country and I call them as I see them. My wife and I went for lunch on 2/21/2012 after reading the reviews on yelp and also wanting to try a new venue. The place has a Med type atmosphere, I liked the pink lighted trees. In two corners of the restaurant are \""booths\"" which hold 10-12 people in which you have to sit \""indian\"" style which I thought was a nice touch. They have been open approx. 5 weeks at this writing and there have been some changes since previous reviews. The food came out warm not hot 15 min after ordering. Check out the scan of the current menu dated 2/22/2012 in the photo section. This is what we got:\n\nLentil stew was complimentary, you get your own from a hot pot in the middle of the rest. and it was hearty. You get one piece of flatbread with each entree ordered, extra flatbread is $1 ea, no big deal. Bread was not as chewy as I like IMO. They have a complimentary hot tea station, and if you order a soft drink, they give you a cup and you go to the self serve soda fountain. Order your food, they give you a number and pick it up when they call your order.\n\nChicken Kabob: $8.99 Eight pieces of one inch square cut chicken breast, 2 cups of rice, a few pieces of sliced onion and radish, a par grilled roma tomato and a lemon wedge. The chicken had no flavor except \""chicken\"" . No seasoning at all, it was cooked well. The rice was cooked well, and I really don't know what was with the raw spanish onions and radishes.\n\nBeef Kabob: $9.99 Eight pieces of one inch square beef steak marinated, 2 cups of rice, a few pieces of sliced onion and radish, a par grilled roma tomato and a lemon wedge. The beef was lightly seasoned and cooked well, nice and tender. The rest was as above.\n\nStuffed Grape Leaves: $2.99 for four leaves. They tasted good, but they were from a can.\n\nSoda: $1.49 ea\n\nThe restaurant was clean as were the restrooms. I have never had Greek / Med food that was so bland. Total check was $24.95 before tax for two people, a bit much for a little meat and a lot of rice. At least the rice filled us up. I mixed the lentil stew into the rice for some flavor as the rice was plain, no seasoning. Weird thing, no lamb on the menu. Now you will know about the food and it is up to you to try it.",1
I can't comment on anything except for the returns/exchanges department. We went to return a part for a fridge that we ordered online and there was quite a long line by the customer service department (it was lunchtime). They could have brought a few more personnel over to help. The return itself was pretty pain-free - he scanned the item and returned the funds to my credit card.,2
"Great staff, open 24-7, clean, and they have security there at night so when things started to get shaky with certain customers they fix the issue fast",3
"Delicious place for breakfast! It is a hidden gem tucked away in the neighborhoods next to downtown Chandler! \n\nAwesome breakfast food! Very friendly, personable service and great decor inside and patio/ garden outside!\n\nThe menu prices are very reasonable for the amount of food you get. The skillets are excellent!!\n\nDefinitely check it out :)",3
"Scheduled an appointment here today based on yelp. Appointment setter was pleasant on phone. Appt was for 12:30, arrived early because I do for all appts, As I value & don't waste other peoples time. Waiting goes into 15 minutes, than now almost 20 minutes & when I thought I heard wax person come for her (my) next appt, she instead comes out to show photos on her cell phone to a client. By this time, she is 20 minutes late for a SCHEDULED appt & obviously no respect or care for being on-time for appts. I canceled & left. That was rude & unprofessional, I would not recommend anyone here with that type of unprofessionalism.",0
I've never been but the line looks huge. Five stars! Also once I saw someone get knocked outside five stars,4
"Mad Mex Oakland, how I want to love you...I want to love you so bad. In previous reviews of Big Burrito restaurants, I noted that the group could do no wrong. Estaba equivocado--disappointment, thy name is Mad Mex.\n\nI don't want this review to be completely negative, though. The margaritas are awesome. The beer list is sweet. They were one of the few places to sport a keg of the Brooklyn Black Chocolate Stout last year. Coming in, sitting at the bar (if you can get a seat), getting an appetizer, and having a good ol' fashioned college night on margaritas blurs together some of my favorite memories of Oakland.\n\nEvery time I make an attempt to eat a substantial meal there, though, I'm reminded again and again as to why I don't go back for years.\n\nThis review is nearly five years in the making. That's almost five years of consistently poor service, mediocre food, and minor mistakes--I've gone through everything from a take-out order being filled incorrectly to being charged for drinks I never received to waiting a long time for a meal (no biggie) only to get the wrong meal (it happens) only to receive the right meal with incorrect options (sour cream instead of guac, what was asked to be on the side wasn't there, etc.).\n\nThere have been up-sides to it, though--servers waiting ten or fifteen minutes to put in our order because we want to take advantage of Happy Hour; usually, as long as it isn't too busy, you can hold a nice small conversation with the servers or bartenders; the ice cream burrito is pretty tasty...but, the downsides are all too common, and nothing has changed in the five years that it took to reach these two stars. The gobble-rito seems like a good reason to try again, and I'm sure in another two months, I'll find myself asking, \""Why don't I go back to Mad Mex?\"", once again completely forgetting the experiences I've had.\n\nI am so sorry.",1
"One of my favorite post-hangover spots in Scottsdale. It's really close to home, dark, chill, and they have great weekend specials. I usually go for the Avacado BLT or the Jalape\u00f1o Burger. The service is good, TV's are everywhere, and their diet cokes are massive!\n\nAll Zipps are good, this one is great!",3
This is the place to go on Monday evenings. Half priced great delicious burgers. Also buy a pint of any of 24 tap beers and receive it in a 20oz mug. Not bad for $7.50. Friendly sports environment in the bar with lots of TV'S.,4
We are new to the area and this was the second vet office we visited. I am glad to say I think we have found our permanent vet! Dr. Laural Casler and all the vet techs took excellent care of our golden retriever. Dr. Casler did a very thorough exam and took time to talk to me about the health concerns with our pet and various treatment options. She even called us a few days later to check up on our dog and see how things were going. I really feel that this office goes above and beyond for their clients. We are very happy here and I wouldn't go anywhere else.,4
Be careful which room you stay in. Currently staying here now and the bathroom pipes gurgle whenever the room next to us uses water. We are stuck in this room and they will only adjust the bill $50. Insane!!! So much for my 3 year old sleeping. Cant wait to leave this place!!!!,0
They have CLOSED!!!,0
Blah. You can find better for less money.\n\nI was disappointed with almost everything about the MGM - it has slipped in recent years. The check in line was unreasonably long (and we were there in the early afternoon). We were underwhelmed at the quality of the room and the furnishings. The casino could use a good cleaning. The whole place has the feeling that it has seen better days. \n\nThere are nicer hotels on the strip.,1
"I have been to the WW in Asheville I Guess more than 30 times always great food service and drinks. BUT... there is something about The WW At this location and one other it seems like it must be KFC.\n     IT all started about 230pm I guess I had passed by this location a few times but, decided to stop. They had a all u can eat wing and soup I think (I am trying to forget). FIRST THE SERVER DID NOT HAVE A CLUE. So I get to the buffet line 4 dried out wings and no soup. I stopped 2 employees and asked about the food they looked at me like I was from MARS...I and I guess 4 people waited for wings nothing came out. I LEFT 3 dollars on the table for the tea and was out of there. I CALLED THE PLACE a few moments later and spoke with a bartender who sounded like he was on crack that said he was 'in charge right now\""HE kept repeating over and over what I was saying so there must have been some sort of medication... issue so I hung up.\n          I called their Corp office and spoke with \""David\"" who said he was a district manager he said the bartender should not have been in charge and laughed about it   ????After he tried to sweep it under the rug he invited me to another location and told me it would be better and after about 3 weeks sent me a letter with a gift card..\n         So after about a month I was stuck in traffic pulled off and decided to give then one more chance... NOT goin to go into the terrible service while there you can message me if anyone wants details.. Anyway got wings to go got home opened the bag and a ROACH CRAWLED OUT DAMM. !!!!!! I called the CORP GUY and he said there is no bugs in that store...I ASKED HIM THEN WHAT JUST CRAWLED OUT A CHICKEN WING? Again he invited me to the location on Ardslye his FLAGSHIP LOCATION NOT ANY BETTER I GAVE UP ON WILD WINGS IN THIS AREA",0
"We went as a group of seven.  We read the review that said the food wasn't good and thought we would give it a try anyways. We now regret that decision, this isn't a place you want to go at all.  The sauces were not good, the spring rolls had a really bad aftertaste like the water was contaminated by minerals and chemicals. The service was great, thus the one star. One member of our group liked her meal and had no complains, 6 out of seven recommend staying away.",0
"Painfully Blah, older business hotel that needs updates and upgrades.  \nThe Good: Central Location, Clean, Friendly Staff \nThe Bad: Paid $300+ for a blah hotel, rooms are old and out-dated, internet is really really slow for a business hotel, food is mediocre. \nNot a fan of this large downtown business hotel. Omni's can be hit or miss, this is a miss. Room decor is old and bed was not comfortable. Internet was super-slow, really? In 2012? TV was newer, but remote was terrible. Small bathroom, loud heater-A/C.  I did like the location and service was very friendly (front desk, valet, concierge, bellman, room service). But, I simply cannot explain how they can charge $300+ on a busy week. That's more than the Ritz in most towns. Meh. Needs total re-do to be worthy. Charlotte is really weak on nice business hotels... The RItz... and then what? Amazingly average hotels here, even name chains (Marriott, Westin, Omni).",1
"I truly went with high expectations. I love BBQ, work at a restaurant with fantastic BBQ, and had heard wonderful things. The atmosphere seemed great, however, the girl working was rude, the water tasted weird, and, overall, I was unimpressed with the BBQ. I truly support small, local businesses such as this one, however, the BBQ sauce had no flavor - it was simply spicy without taste - and the pit beans tasted a lot like burnt beef. From a restaurant perspective, I wish they would have a sweeter, more tasty BBQ sauce, more durable buns for the pulled pork sandwiches, and nicer customer service. I may go back and try it again at some point, but, overall, I'm sad to say I was disappointed.",1
An old house converted into a pub. Great outdoor seating. OK food though. Staying dry this month so didn't indulge in any libations. I enjoy restaurants which aren't in steel and stucco glass boxes so this place was nice and warm. I could be there for quite a while feeling like home.,2
"Please do not board your dog here. I just picked my dog up and she has a giant bleeding wound on her nose! See attached photo.  \n\nI dropped her off two days ago. When I did I was hesitant because of other reviews on how the doctors hit the dogs and they are boarded in bathrooms and storage rooms (read other Yelp reviews and google ones). I asked if I could see where they stay and was told I couldn't. I then asked about the other reviews I read and was dismissed and kinda laughed at. Fast forward to two days later. I pick up my pup and get her home and into the bathtub (because she smells awful after leaving there) and notice her nose is all bloody and raw.  I immediately call the animal hospital and tell the receptionist what happened. She tells me to hold on and she'll ask. She comes back on the phone and says my dog was upset that I was gone and started scratching her nose. Well that's impossible because she has an e collar on because her ear just had to be amputated and she can't even get to her nose with that on. I inform her of this and she gets upset and says oh ummm well here talk to the doctor. The doctor explained that the place where they are boarded had a wire door and dogs can stick their nose underneath and scratch it. Several things about this concern me. First off, why would they have a door that could injure your dog. Then why would the front office girl give me a different story?  Lastly...she has an e collar on and can't even get her nose close enough to anything without the e collar stopping her. It would have been impossible for her nose to get stuck under a door! What are they doing to these dogs that cause their noses to become bloody and raw??!! How are they treating them??!!  The parting words from the doctor were \""well it's not an ideal situation\"".  That is an understatement...my dog has a bloody, raw nose...sounds more like abuse to me.",0
"Only the Biltmore Apple Store can make the typical shopper (me) feel like a total douche just by walking inside of it to be exposed to the cultish behaviors of Apple fanboys and girls.  This must be, like, the Ganges of Apple secularism.  One might introspect, \""Is this me?\""\n\nNo.  Its okay.  You certainly aren't one of the tools extolling Steve Jobs father's testicles for blessing the planet with the Divinity who created the most streamlined electronic products ever exalted on God's green Ge.  But look around, and this is what you will see at this particular locus.\n\nInteracting with the sales associates, these coal-shirted devotees, is what I imagine Muhammad faced when he met his 72 virgins in heaven.  These virgins, however, are massively haughty and generally useless. \n\nIn order for one of them to grace your presence and acknowledge your need for assistance, one must either 1) act like you're walking out of their store with one of their pretentious product under your shirt, or 2) make an appointment with their \""Genius Bar\"".\n\nF me running.  What a crappy state of affairs customer service is at this place. \n\nLet me get this straight, I cannot get anyone to help sell me overpriced, buggy Apple products unless I had the foresight to book their arses a week before?  Moreover, should the frequently occurring Apple jinx strike my iPod, its gonna take an appointment to tell me that you cannot fix it because you are not, IN FACT, a genius, but a $10 an hour fandork of Apple products and you wanted the 5% employee discount?\n\nThe 2 times that I've had problems with my iPod (i know, what a shocker!), they've just suggested that I reformat, thus erasing all of my files and losing playlists, et al.  Thanks genius.  Thanks for keeping up the good fight vs Microsoft, dweeb.\n\nAnd thanks for allowing me to check out -- not at the cashwrap, but right here, where we stand -- amongst the packed section of iPhones, where people are dorking out to these things.  I appreciate the dapper service, even though I'm plopping down the loot for two 'pods (which will inevitably be returned for two new ones in a few short months after I stump the geniuses over at the bar).  \n\nNow, I'm just blue-skying here, but how about you treat me like an actual human customer instead of an ATM machine, given that I've purchased 6 or so Apple products within the past 4 years?   \n\nI hate that Apple has been crushing the portable music market for several years now because their outposts for customer service are absolutely abysmal.",1
"We frequent Genghis Grill quite a bit and I'm not sure what happened yesterday but our service was AWFUL! First, my bowl was cooked without the sauce I clearly placed next to my bowl.  Then, my boyfriend's bowl came without the rice he ordered. Lastly, our waitress came to check on us once and that was to drop off the wrong drink.  The place wasn't very busy so I was really surprised at the lousy service.",1
"2nd stop on my birthday extravaganza lead us to Fleur.  My friend visited this place last year for her birthday and got to meet Hubert Keller in the flesh.  I wasn't so lucky LOL but no worries.  We were here to enjoy some dessert and drinks after a great meal at Mix.  \n\nAlong with our drinks, we also got the grand marnier souffle and vanilla creme br\u00fbl\u00e9e.  I thought the creme brulee was on point!  It was served with a vanilla cream foam and fruit.  The creme brulee was served in a  rectangular dish which was suitable for 4 people to share off of.  The souffle was not as delightful in my opinion.  Although I've had souffle before, this one had a strong egg odor.  It was served with orange flavored cream and ice cream.  As long as you mixed all the components, it was tolerable. \n\nThe best part of the evening came when our server brought a plate with 4 banana cream muffins, fruit, a lit candle and chocolate words reading, \""Happy Birthday.\""  Such a great touch!  \n\nHaven't had dinner there, and from our desserts only, it was ok.  I will come back to try their enticing menu.  Next time, I will raise my rating if Hubert comes out to greet us! LOL.",2
"This quaint aloha-feel place has some delicious pancakes. There's always usually a wait to dine in, so sometimes Ill pick up breakfast to bring home. I recommend the red velvet or banana pancakes. When it comes to anything else, it's your typical breakfast items. No one can mess up eggs, bacon, or hash right? Service and prices are mediocre. \n\nOne major thumbs down is that there was a few ants on the wall next to my table when I've dined in before. \n\nThey've recently added a new location & I would tell people to check it out at least once for their pancake craving while in Vegas. I'm a waffle person & their pancakes still got me salivating.",2
I stopped by for lunch.  Only have 30 mins so its nice to get a yummmy but quickly delivered ramen.  Thanks!,4
"Strange, came here on a whim after not having reservations anywhere in Vegas, and being extremely hungry at 8:30pm, which would have been peak hours. Guess I was lucky that night. Come to think of it, I was. I made $475 at roulette that night. \n\nAsked for a table for 3 - and immediate seating, right along the outer wall, so that we could people watch. No bad experience with 45 minute waits, or being rejected for seating. Strange group of people sifting through Vegas at those hours.\n\nOrdered a carpaccio, and a special rib-eye steak pasta.\nMy girlfriend ordered the Calamari and Fusilli pasta, with proscuitto, peas, and truffle butter.\n\nCarpaccio - Not sure what to expect. Quite good, peppery with the peppercorns, arugula. Felt like it was missing some dressing, however. Parmesan Regianno was a bit overpowering. Seasoned mushrooms on top of the carpaccio was a good touch though.\n\nCalamari - Excellent consistency and seasoning. Not overpoweringly salty, tender calamari, but crispy batter on outside. Slight lime flavoring to accompany the taste. Basil aioli was a bit excessive, but nicely placed on the side, so completely optional. Fried pepperoncini also was quite good, made me want to eat it even though I'm not a fan of milder peppers in general.\n\nRib-eye pasta - A very heavy pasta, using Radiatore pasta, with rib-eye steak and caramelized onions. Rib-eye was a bit overdone, in my opinion. Did not seem as tender, and did not take advantage of the natural marbling of typical rib-eye. May not have been the best cut. However, flavoring was excellent. Very hearty, like a stew. Good for a warmer day, though in Vegas, that never happens.\n\nFusilli - Brilliant pasta dish. Although, it's not hard to mess up this one. Simple Fusilli con Piselli e Proscuitto. Though tasted so rich, likely due to truffle butter. Mmm. Truffle butter.\n\nService was a bit weird. We had another over-excited waiter. Edged on creepy. Though he was there when we needed him, and very witty for the times - I believe he took us to be a young crowd, and adapted accordingly.\n\n5 stars - Excellent food - and reasonable prices. -1 for overcooked ribeye in pasta. +1 for immediate seating. +2 for excellent tender and yet crispy calamari (probably some of the best I've had), and truffle butter.",4
"I so wanted to give this theater a higher review, but after three different visits, there are a few reasons I cannot.  First the pros:\n\n1.  The staff are all very friendly, helpful, and attentive.  They have done a great job hiring the right people.\n\n2.  The chairs are extremely comfortable and perfect for sitting for a few hours watching a movie.\n\n3.  There are no little kids crying during the movie like at Christown just down the street.  (It's not their fault their parents bring them to movies that are not at all age-appropriate and they're bored to tears.  Parents need smacked upside the head.)\n\n4.  I feel safe parking and walking to the theater from the parking garage if I want to go to the movies alone.\n\n5.  Did I mention how awesome the staff is?  They really are *that* good.\n\nOkay, now the cons.  This list is shorter.\n\n1.  The popcorn here sucks.  I've tried it twice and it was horrible, cold, and I got a couple of bites that tasted like chemicals.  The popcorn should be spectacular at a high-end movie theater - especially when it costs $8.\n\n2.  The food is mediocre.  I ordered chicken fingers and fries.  The fries were decent, but the chicken fingers were soggy like they'd been microwaved.  Disgusting.\n\n3.  And, last but not least, I've tried a couple of times to drink their iced tea, but it's the worst iced tea I've ever had - and it's $5 for a very large glass of it.  Again, there are just some basic things that have to be great.  I'd think iced tea in the summer in Arizona should be good everywhere.  It's pretty bad when the QT gas station down the street has better iced tea - and for only $1.50.  :-/\n\nIf AMC can get the quality control sorted out with the food, then this would be an absolutely perfect venue.  It's clean, quaint, and I love the vibe of it very, very much.  I just wish the food and drinks were better quality.",2
"I really enjoyed this gym, until the zumba classes got too crowded. :( Tiny weight room, okay cardio theater. Okay child care room, they often loved to say \""so...you'll be back in an hour right?\"" at first it was funny, after the 5th time, it was annoying and rude. \n\nI'm THANKFUL to the YMCA for offering a free membership to Creech families and faimlies of deployed members.",2
"This was my third time in Vegas and the second best hotel that I stayed in. The worst was Circus Circus and the best was The Mandalay  Bay. The Mirage was pretty decent, it was clean for the most part and not crazy expensive. I checked out some reviews on Yelp and they weren't too bad so that was a good thing.\n\nGot there on a Sunday around 11am expecting to wait to check in because check in was at 3 or something. Surprisingly they checked me with no problem so I was happy about that. The employees were pretty nice and helpful which is always a plus in my book. I got to my room and it was a nice size but the bathroom was a little small for my liking. Also the bathtub was just a regular size which is fine because I didn't reserve a suite or anything.\n\nThey have some decent places to eat like a burger spot I went to it wasn't the best burger I had but it was good. The star of that burger spot was the milkshakes which I had a Twinkie shake but it needed more caramel. I didn't spend too much time at the Mirage because I was at the Venetian across the street which has a pretty nice food court. My favorite was the Haagen das ice cream, the pizza and the lobster.\n\nSo if I came back to Vegas would I stay at the Mirage probably not but I did enjoy my stay and it was affordable. There wasn't anything really bad about the Mirage but it wasn't my cup of tea.",3
"I try never to be the customer who complains.. But customer service at this place just sucks so bad.\n\nI can totally understand when you're having trouble with your payout system with the slot machines. What I don't understand is why do you keep letting people use the machines despite them not being able to get their winnings or even their remaining balance back. After waiting for over 40 minutes, we gave up because we had to go somewhere else.\n\nAlso, I'm sure they're frustrated as well. But I got nothing but attitude from the casino staff after I complained about this. I would've sympathized with them more if they weren't such d!cks. \n\nThanks for ruining our Christmas vacation. We won't be staying with you ever again in the future.",0
"Decent beef noodle soup, with just the right amount of spiciness.  However, service was unorganized and orders got mixed up.  One of our orders never came out and we had to remind the waitress that we were expecting another dish.  Prices are good though if you're looking for an inexpensive restaurant off the strip.",2
"Overhyped in my opinion. I understand this part of the strip has been pretty dead and they've been trying to bring some life back into this part of town but they could have spent a bit more time looking at other clubs and seeing how they could have one upped them. \n\nWent pre-opening weekend to see Hardwell and it was awesome. Lights and sound were awesome along with the endless amount of confetti. That air thingy though sucks. I mean I can barely feel it.\n\nWent a bit early to get in and that took forever. I mean it was SLOW and after I went in, it was still empty. Stairs weren't was bad as Marquee but dark enough for a drunk person to eat it. Dance floors are a bit bigger which is nice. Did I mention there's a large abundance of restrooms?\n\nI'll be back depending on DJ and because of my friends but this place lacked a lot of things such as an open area to sit down. I mean other clubs offer crappy seating but at least that's something instead of nothing. Tables aren't really going to cut it especially when you can't even sell out all the tables. Oh did I mention drinks are bit pricier here?",2
"\""Have you ever been to Ellie's?\"" asked my fellow yelper Phil M. \n\""Umm... yeah, once at the governance center.\"" \n\""No! Her new resturant. She has a legit resturant in town.\""\n\""No way!\"" I exclaimed. \n\""Yeah, it's somewhere in Chandler. I haven't been, but I thought maybe you have\""\n\""hmm... no. I have to check it out sometime.\""\n\nAnd days later... I did just that.\n\nEllie started her business from a humble frybread stand made out of plywood and nails and moved up to the Governance Center's inhouse deli and earned the money and experience to finally open her own resturant with her husband in Chandler. I remember going to her stand in Sacaton and everyone always complimented her amazing frybread. I especially loved her salsa! And when she went to the Governance Center (also in Sacaton) I would love to devour her stews while talking tribal politics with one of my best friends. And the other day, I had the chance to try her new legitimate resturant in Chandler.\n\nEllie is from the Gila River Indian Community, in a different district than mine. She operates her restuant with her husband who is Mexican and they have combined their cuisines to open Ellie's Native & Mexican Food. It sounds funny to me, it sounds like Native Mexican food, which would be different from the americanized version of Mexican food! but alas... that's not what you'll find at Ellie's.\n\nWe came in and Ellie wasn't there. Meh, I didn't really expect her there, but it would've been nice. (oh well) Anyway, I tried the 2 tacos with rice & beans and an extra plain frybread. The tacos are totally Gringo tacos with hamburger meat instead of shredded beef. The rice is way yummy but the beans were forgetable. I've had and made way better. The bread was good. I ordered it plain but the server/cashier offered to bring me some powdered sugar and/or honey... but as always, I chose ONE of those options... not BOTH! \n\nIf you're going to each frybread as a dessert... it NEEDS to have eaither powdered sugar OR honey... NOT BOTH! Okay... i'm done with the frybread rant... I'm sure you're all tired of it anyway! :P\n\nBut anywhoo... I asked for some honey and he brought it in a lil condiment container which was great because I ate my beans with half the frybread and then after I was done with m food, I broke out the honey and had the second half as dessert. Their bread is HUGE! Oh my gosh! Even by Native standards these things are huge. The bread was what all good frybread is: light, crispy, crunchy yet soft and warm. I totally recommend getting the small container with honey to go with the bread so you too can have your bread as part of your meal and for dessert! :)\n\nMy mom had a frybread with beans with a side order of rice. Which she liked but wished we went home and had me make it instead. Oh well... \n\nBUT They have one of those popcorn poppers but it's filled with chips! and you can grab as much as you want and they have these baskets for you to fill them up with and a full salsa bar right next to it. I tried most of their salsas and I really liked the well chopped hot salsa. She liked the chunky salsa. \n\nOverall, it's a nice clean place. The service was good, but not overwhelmingly friendly. The frybread was good but the beans were eh. The tacos were good - but were gringo tacos. I personally don't mind, but someone else might. The rice was very good! I love their frybites. Which are like sopapillas I presume but made with frybread dough. :) The best of both worlds.\n\nTo my yelpers: I'd like to say that I'm very proud of Ellie for growing her business from the most humblest of beginnings. It takes a lot of determination to go from literally a shack made of plywood on the reservation to a real legitamate business in town. I hope you give her place a try. Especially if you're in that area. Give her chili (red or green) a try. Enjoy the salsa bar and remember... get honey OR powdered sugar... not BOTH! and enjoy!",3
"This place is always our \""fancy\"" dinner while visiting Vegas!  Every lady receives a rose while being seated. We always think about the taxi driver who recommended this place years ago, otherwise,  we may have never heard of this gem.  The salad cart is always fun for a custom made salad and the sorbet to cleanse the palate is always my favorite.",4
"I haven't been at Le Finlandais in well over a decade, however, a last minute decision prompted us to attempt a spa experience without needing to drive too far from Montreal. There are many reasons why we haven't come back to this spa but since we've heard about how recent renovations made this place \""so much better\"" curiosity finally got the best of us... and we paid the price for it... literally.\n\nTHE GOOD\n\n- The place is visually appealing : If you're here early enough to experience the site with very few present people. Everything looks really esthetically nice with a beautiful forest and river to look at only a few steps away. I personally liked the docks and the seats near the forest and spent some time there. Since it was nearly October, the staff decorated the place with what seemed like a hundred pumpkins. It was all very pretty.\n\nTHE MEH\n\n- The massage experience : As a massage lover, I tend to get a massage about once a month or so and already have my established spots to go to. However, I'm always open to new experiences so if you like a very light massage with very little effect to your body, Le Finlandais is the place to go. Furthermore, a 60 minute massage costs you $99. If you want a \""deep massage\"" it's $105. Really?? Forget the fact that this pricing is simply not competitive with so many other fine places you can visit in the area. Forget the fact that only the 60 minute option is available.... but to charge... $6 more to get a deep massage? Ridiculous.\n\nSure, as mentioned by other Yelpers, you can most likely wait and opt for a special opening during the day to get a cheap massage but let's be honest with ourselves, I want a turn-key, stress free experience when going to the spa and not have to check-in every so often to see if a spot opened up during the day. The last thing this place needs is even more foot traffic. There's already plenty of it.\n\n- The lockers seem to have a new RFID bracelet system that looks cool but can be somewhat problematic. As luck would have it, my first bracelet simply didn't work on my locker... perhaps it was broken or perhaps it's because it's been marked wrong as they use a marker that easily goes away during your spa experience and needs to be re-written per client visit. Odds are, the 1st bracelet I got had this issue. So make sure you remember your locker number because the number will vanish quickly.\n\n- There's been a few additions during the years, including a new Russian section (covered more in detail in Ugly) and some new bubble seats that seem to float on the warm baths. Let's talk about these bubbles. Overall, it's a nice experience despite the bubbles being a bit too close for comfort. My major issue is that even in 10 degree weather I got cold simply because the bubble is floating a bit too much. Most of my legs and my butt were comfortable but my upper body and my knees?? were actually cold. If the bubble was deeper into the water the experience could be far more enjoyable.\n\n- The staff is very present, in fact so much so they seriously add to the \""busiest spa ever\"" experience. They seem really good at what they do, they are present and I saw them repeatedly tell people in the pools to... SHUT UP! Then I caught staff chilling out and chatting it up themselves when they weren't busy for minutes on end.\n\nTHE UGLY\n\n- If you like seeing lots of people in swimsuits then you'll be in luck! If you want to feel a more traditional spa experience then avoid this place! It can truly be a fashion show with as much foot traffic as St-Catherine street trying to find chairs and especially hot bath space. The waiting room to get a massage is almost a claustrophobic experience with a long line-up of massage therapists waiting their turn to call their client while patrons wait in a small communal room. \n\n- The place isn't completely quiet as you'll always hear people talking... particularly at the hot baths. Seriously people, SHUT UP! This truly broke my spa immersion. People can always hear you even when you're walking around mumbling to each other. It sounds like MUUUMUMMMUMUUUMMUMMMUM! Annoying. The whole place sounds like a \""hushed\"" library than a \""spa experience\"".\n\n- So how busy is it? Well, so busy there's a line-up to attempt use the new Russian sauna. That's right. A line-up! As if I'm at La Ronde! I checked it later when it didn't have one but how awkward it was trying to quietly slip between people to your small wet seat. ICH!!!\n\n- Do come here with your own personal robe and water bottles or be prepared to pay the price. We brought our water bottles but I didn't bring my robe since we have been lavishly spoiled and pampered at other spa places that always provided them you them free of cost. A single robe rental here is an expensive $9. I could understand a few bucks but almost a Sir John A. Macdonald dollar bill? Outright thievery!!!",1
"Ok Ive eaten here twice now once before they expanded and again today.  I like the layout with the bar, outdoor seating and plenty of indoor space so you dont feel like people are piled on top of you like some breakfast joints.  My wife had the benedict with spinach and side of bacon which turned out to be the best part of her meal as she requested the eggs without runny whites which is basically what she received.  I was a little disappointed with the Huevos Rancheros the flavor was ok but nothing impressed me.  We ordered the Arizona Fire Corn because it sounded interesting and found the flavor to be good here however they charge $3.29 for a few tablespoons of this side; a little to proud if you ask me.  On a positive note our server was very good which helped the average food until our bill hit the table.  $41.50 and another $8.00 for tip we were out the door at $50 for two breakfasts, 2 Ice Teas and a couple of very small sides we wanted to try.  I like this place just dont love it but the location is great so what the heck maybe we'll give it another chance next time where in the area.",2

"Bed bugs!!!!!!! Bed bugs. My husband and I had to stay at the Stratosphere until our apt was ready to move in. I was in one room and everything in the bathroom stopped working we were switched to another room. I woke up two days later with what I thought was a rash at the time. I went to quick care and was told that the appeared to be Bed Bug bites. I went back to the room and low and behold there were several Bed Bugs I found. I immediately told the hotel manager and was moved to another room. I made a report with the security. I had bites all over my body that turned into these big dark spots that looked like little rashes. No one never inspected the room while I was there this was done days later. Security took pictures of my body in the new room. I had to buy all these different itch  creams, take all my cloths, bags, luggages, shoes ect to the cleaners to get steamed cleaned and washed because the only way to kill these Bed Bugs are by high heat. Finally risk managment got intouch woth me and said theu had some one come to check it out and it was negative sign of bed begs. I have pictures showing these things. The hotel didnt compensate me for all the money I had to spend to get rid of these bugs they offered me a complimentary dinner at the nasty a** disgusting resturant cafe these people are a fuc****  joke and im still suffing from the incident. This hotel is the fuc**** worst. Please please spend a little extra money and find a better hotel to stay at. The worst hotel in my life.",0
3 hours for a painted on french who paints on freches anymore and I dont care what type of 3d art you're doing none of it should take 3 hours although the staff is very nice and had fun talking with them. They're very disorganized poorly managed and you don't get what you pay for not even at $35 good thing I didn't pay the 65 that they wanted I won't go back,0
"This is a new BBQ place on the outskirts of Sun Prairie, just before you head on out towards Columbus.  It's located in a building that doesn't appear to get much business.  I say this because over the years there have been many sandwich shops that have come and gone, with each business only lasting a year or less.  The only business in this teeny tiny strip mall that has withstood the test of the economic times is the Ammo Box.  \n\nThis was our first try here.  The inside is pretty bare bones.  It has about the same seating size as Smoky Jon's for dining in.  With Porktropolis, you go in, decide from 7 different sauces, that you can taste test, and then order varying sizes of ribs.  Then you get the sauce of your choice and add it to your meat yourself.  Each order of ribs comes with 2 sides and bread.  \n\nOn this particular occasion we tried a quarter rack of ribs with the Sweet Memphis Blues sauce, with campfire potatoes, calico beans and bread.  All the sides were of the sad, plain, you can get something better in a can at the store variety.\n\nThe meat was tender and juicy with no fat detected.  The Memphis sauce tasted appropriate when testing, but once it was on the meat, it failed to have that nice kick that rib enthusiasts are usually looking for.  \n\nWe will probably go here again specifically for the ribs, especially if we don't feel like driving into Madison for Smoky Jon's.  \n\nThey also have sandwiches, party packs of ribs, and desserts that include chocolate bacon.",1
"I recently worked with Nic on floral arrangements for a Supper Club to benefit the Cancer Research Institute, and found him to be the absolute best person to work with! The arrangements were gorgeous and he totally worked with my ideas to create exactly what I wanted. Everything was arranged and delivered in the most timely fashion. We communicated EVERY step of the way (despite the transatlantic distance) to figure out all the details. Overall, I have nothing but the most positive things to say about Starbright, and especially Nic! Pros: completely customized service, flexible, super friendly",4
"Apparently people love this place and there are some redeeming qualities.  We were there on a Saturday evening around 7pm and the customer service experience was not stellar.  We experienced long wait times for drinks and the waiter rarely came back to check on our table.  It seemed like they had plenty of food runners but hardly any wait staff.  They were grossly understaffed and the managers were not jumping in to help.  When I received my food it was ok.  I had the pickle chips, which were excellent.  I also had the wedge salad with the balsamic vinaigrette dressing.  The salad was very nice but the dressing was mostly oil and had no flavor.  The others sitting next to me enjoyed the other dressing selections though.  My main course was the grinder sandwhich with the marinara sauce which they call Sunday gravy  and beef meatballs.  The bread was stale and the marinara was sparsely applied.  Unfortunately I can get a better meatball sandwich at the local bar with half the hassle.  To be fair though, once we finally got the waiters attention and ordered the food, the food came quickly and in the correct order.  I really enjoyed the overall atmosphere and decor in general but they do have some construction going on at the moment so there is a plastic tarp over the stairwell going to the second floor and this is right in the middle of the restaurant.  Not sure at this point if I will go back.",1
"I get disappointed that I can shop at a location for more than a year and purchase much larger quantities of food than the average shopper and I still encounter an attitude.\n\nFood prices are reasonable and really, that's all I typically need there.\nMost of the staff is helpful.\n\nI wish they would stock the ProPlan by Purina since it is a product my dogs have done well on a good portion of their life.\nUnfortunately I have to go to the big PeTA backed pet store to pick it up most of the time.",2
"I'd been here a number of years back, and I'm glad I came back!  Good food, great beer selection, and outstanding service (even on a busy night.)  We only went for a snack and a few beers, but I'll be going back and augmenting this review as needed!",3
"We had dinner here before heading out to a show because one of my friends that we were with has a little bro who's obsessed with Sammy Hagar. The place was pretty empty, so we got seated quickly.\n\nFor a place that's named after a tequila brand, I was expecting WAY more from my margarita. Super, super sugary and not much tequila taste, and no where near enough salt.\n\nThe place gets 2 stars because the nachos were really good. They're \""build your own\"" and over priced, but tasty and a HUGE amount. But they arrived just a couple min before the rest of our food. And the rest of the food was TERRIBLE. My husband said the fish tacos were just ok, and everything on my combo plate was bland and greasy. \n\nService was super slow for an empty restaurant, but the girl who came around to take pics was nice, and the hostesses let us snag a menu for my friend's bro.\n\nWe ate at Salsa Cantina in Miracle Mile a couple nights before and it was SOOOO much better, even the margaritas, and cheaper. Save yourself the trip to Cabo Wabo unless you're drinking Modelo on the patio to people watch... bottled beer they can handle.",1
"A nice selection of higher end suitcases and backpacks if you're looking to purchase something that the airlines can toss around while you blast your way through the skies at 400 miles an hour. They have regular suitcases, rollaboards, spinners and the like ranging in size from small to extra large.\n\nPrices, in the other hand, range from medium to high. I don't know about you, but I'm just not going to spend $180 for a rollaboard suitcase unless it comes stuffed with $1 bills.",1
Read the reviews and the ratings and we made the trip to Toms'.  Food was tasty well presented and we enjoyed the atmosphere.

The meat needs more seasoning, and I'm not a big fan of the bun, but I'll forgive and forget. I am a big fan.

"The worse meal and service I have ever had in Vegas .... Yuck beware of the food I came here with a group of friends about 11pm at night and it sucked ( excuse my French). First we had to move to the bar in order to get any kind of service and second the place was completely empty and we had to literally scream HEY !!!! Well after ordering tatter tots and grilled chesses the basic American meal, never received a drink. When i received my food my tatter tots were cold and hard as a rock and my grilled chesses was cold and no longer chesses which was disgusting... How can you go wrong with grilled cheese!!!!! This place was horrible doesn't make it any better that the bartender disappeared and had to wait for ever for the bill..... The place was disgusting, my parties meal wasn't any better but ill let them complain on there own YELP page.",0
"NOTE: Unlike BOA, I am happy to be contacted about my experiences and will speak to everyone who wants to hear more about my nightmare, below. Any of you (including you, BOA) can reach me at joltin@aol.com (please subject any emails, \""BOA ISSUE\"" or I may not see). BOA, its people and these kind of systems are deliberately engineering the US economy to take money away from those who can least afford it. \n\nFIGHT BACK!!\n\n-------------------\n\nOMG!!!\n\nWhat a ripoff!!!! They systematically steal our money in the form of government handouts and then, because they need more to fund their crooked system, come at us all individually. This is bold-faced theft and the individuals involved should really be criminally charged - yes Tara Tatro - this includes you!\n\nAnyone know a good attorney?--seems like we might have enough for a class action. \n\nMICHAEL  MOORE - GOT A SUBJECT FOR YOU!!! \n\nMy background: \nI had a $7,000 credit limit w BOA and have had zero late payments on my account for at least 2 years. During the last year I maintained a higher balance-  in the$ 6,000 area. As I've moved into cleaning up my finances, I paid off BOA. IMMEDIATELY, they lowered my credit line a crazy amount. Not to $5,000, not $3000 but to $500 dollars in July 2009 - a 93% credit line decrease!!! How can  you even pretend to justify this? In the end, they claimed that they re-reviewed my credit and this is what they came up with - despite my always paying on time. Keep in mind, my credit has had NO new negative entries in over two years!!!\n\nWhat does this mean ?- It means BOA was happy has a cow to charge my 20+% interest on a 6,000 balance (about $250 per month) but then once I paid it down -restrict my access to the charge card.  WAIT A MINUTE!!! So if you accept I paid them this interest for a year, they've stolen $3,000 from me and now won't let me ( a proven paying customer) charge anything anymore. AND because they've lowered my credit line, they've lowered my credit utilization percentage and hence my further access to the credit market - think home purchase.\n\nCan you see how they trap you?\n\nSo, I call Customer Service to complain... their response? \""Tough\""... argh.... Next step, I go visit a branch to have this explained to me. The branch GM is very nice, researches it with his resources and comes back with the answer that he is sorry but doesn't know how this happened or the rationale. He asks me to let him know what I find out. \n\nDouble ARGH!!!!! Think about that, the branch manager is asking me to figure out what's going on with this thieving company!!!\n\nSo, then I call the corporate offices in Charlotte and ask to speak to the VP of Customer Relations. The operator informs me that they can't put any callers through to any executives. Given we (taxpayers) just gave them how many zillion, this seems very strange to me I tell her. The operator is very nice says that she understood but she is systemically prevented from transferring a call or giving out a phone # for executives. \n\nWOW!! Its like Bank Of Darth Vader - isn't it?\n\nSo, then I try this executive customer service line (704-386-5687 - thank you Consumerist!!!). I initially get a very nice lady named Melanie who promises me that they'll be able to fix the situation. She then transfers me to a Tara Tatro (she sounds very young and is quick with the insults). When I ask her title, she tells me her title is \""works in the Office of the Chairman  & CEO\"" and refuses to give me any more info.  (BTW, Did you know this exec customer service department is Tampa? Why does Ken Lewis need to have an office that reports directly to him in Tampa - Winter home???)\n\nShe looks into my file and comes back with the same answer - tough. She tells me she found something on my credit report that was late. I challenge her on this because I monitor my reports and I have a 700 score. I ask her what specifically she sees - she won't tell me. She then asks me what credit report I am looking at - I don't tell her, but ask her which one she is looking. Again she won't respond - kinda odd, particularly since my main bank just saw fit to give me a $15k unsecured line of credit - don't you think?\n\nI mean seriously - these guys take zillions of $$s out of the economy so they can line their pockets with fat bonuses, extra homes and country club memberships.  And they cant be made available to anyone? \n\nI point out that this kind of extortion is exactly what's put them in hot water with congress and the American public and how I really didn't understand the timing of their decision to reduce my credit limit. Whatever motivated them COULD NOT have happened during the month they lowered my scores, because I subscribe to the credit monitoring services.\nWAKE UP EVERYONE!!! - THEY ARE STEALING FROM US ALL AND, AS THEY SAY, LAUGHING ALL THE WAY TO THE BANK!!\nPlease don't fall into the vicious trap I did. They don't treat rich people this way.",0
"They take their time with manicures and do a good job making it looked polished in the very end.  I just got a full white tip set and I'm pretty happy with it, but the skin by my ring finger was burned by the burrs of the instrument.  \n\nThe experience really depends on which nail tech you get here.  The old man with glasses (I'll find out his name!) always does a wonderful job, has years of experience and is very friendly!\n\nThe pedicures are great.  The polish stays on for at least a straight month!  They could spend a little more time on the massage portion of the pedi though.  \n\nOverall, great location, friendly staff and decent prices.",2
"This place was disgusting, and of course by disgusting I mean awesome.  And I suppose I also mean disgusting, because lets face it, Pomeroy's is not intended for the faint of heart.\n\nA group of us came pummeling on Saturday night after Amber W. and the Second Time Ever boys were kind enough to give us a Sunnyslope Art Walk preview (which kicked ass by the way) and immediately I was hooked.\n\n$2.75 Amber Bocks ALL DAY and a late night menu with grilled cheeses, chicken fingers, and mozzarella sticks? Where do I sign up? Like seriously, that is my holy trifecta of late night bar food, and this particular bar food was delicious.  And I can say that with great confidence because believe it or not, I wasn't drunk, so I could actually taste it : )  Be prepared to wait though, because the service for certain members of our party (sorry Jordan) was SLOW.\n\nYes, the table was filthy and no one once came over to clean it.  Yes, the clientele was a bit on the unwashed side.  And yes, there were at least 5 people in there that wanted to kill me for no other reason that I made the mistake of walking in with a designer bag.  But listen, Pomeroys make's ZERO excuses for itself, and really, what self-respecting dive bar should?\n\nThat said, before my next visit to Pomeroys, I will dirty myself up a bit and dress in the finest wife beater I own, and it will be on, because no amount of salty bar patrons will stand between me and my $2.75 Amber Bocks, so don't even try...",3
"Well, you pay for what you get. I'd stayed at Mandalay prior to this and OMG it was night and day. I got here early and asked for a great view, which I got. That was the coolest part of my stay. This hotel is ghetto. It's ugly outside but you can forgive that but the rooms feel like they've not been updated since 1973. The wallpaper in Tower 1 looks original; we were on a nonsmoking floor that had to have been a smoking floor at some point. The room had two small lights. One lamp by the bed and an old kind of hanging light over this ugly small table. They do not have wifi in this hotel either. They did have an ethernet (if you have a laptop and not a tablet!). The view rocked but the water pressure in the hotel was practically just a drip; I hated it. It was sooooo 1970s, no wonder I paid $80 a night.",0
"Sat and waited and no one came. We had to find someone to get help. We waited about 45 minutes for our drink order. Another 20-30 minutes for our food (which we ordered at the same time as our drinks). Our waiter was not friendly, kept rubbing his nose and eyes, and kept looking away. He was not happy to be there, and it showed. Another one of his tables openly told him how bad his service was as they left, so I know it's not just me complaining. We spoke with the manager, who was nice and understanding, but still we will not be coming back. I've never had worse service at any restaurant.\n\nThe food was decent, and other servers seemed to be okay. Experience was terrible.",0
"After a few years and Many trips to VIVA staying at many places on the strip , staying at the Hard Rock, is like going back Home . small , easy to get to rooms , nice comfy beds , great sound system in the Room , open the french doors and got a nice fall breeze in the room , or open the doors and  watch the Craziness of rehab at The Pool. After many years away , I'm glad I stayed Here again.",3
"For a while I was debating whether I should be giving this place 2 stars or 3. I originally had the intention of giving it a 3.5. All the stars for this place go to our server, Anthony who was very friendly, attentive, and helpful.\n\nI came here for a late dinner with my sister and brother in law. We've been to other Mario Batali and Joe Bastianich restaurants and were very impressed so we had some pretty high expectations in B&B Burger & Beer. Unfortunately, my expectations were shot down.\n\nFirst off, the decor is pretty casual. It's supposed to be a burger joint so it's simple. I personally think the location is a little too hidden. It's in the sports book area in The Venetian (as Mike C. has pointed out) a little past Noodle Asia. There was no line, and the two girls up front who were hostesses were friendly and helped get us seated right away.\n\nI ordered the morning burger (minus the egg) along with a side of fries, my sister had a spicy burger of some sort, my brother in law ordered the pastrami, and we shared a side order of buffalo wings. Almost everything came highly recommended by Anthony, so our hungry stomachs waited excitedly for the food.\n\nComing from SoCal, I'm not sure if maybe I've just been spoiled senseless by the amount of gourmet burgers in the area (The Counter, Slaters 50/50, and Umami to name a few) but all three of us were very disappointed. \n\nThe buffalo wings tasted hard and almost frozen. The sesame on my burger bun tasted too hard for the bread and to sum it up, the best word to describe it would probably be \""forgettable.\"" The pastrami was at best average, and my sister's burger was so overly spicy, she was barely able to eat it. \n\nThe reason why I ended up giving this place 2 stars is because even though Anthony was attentive enough to note to the cook in the back that many customers during the day had complained it was overly spicy, management still did not do anything to make it better. He suggested we just write on the comment card at the end of the meal that we thought the burger was too spicy. There was no offer to make up for it and no attempt to please the customer.\n\nI think B&B has some great potential, but considering it has just opened a little over a week ago, it's absolutely vital to be listening to its customers to make the experience more memorable and better, considering all the other competition for food choices on the Strip.",1
"Been into Indian food lately, a friend suggested this place..i was skeptical because its hard to find good indian food places..however once i tasted the food i was delighted, i have finally found my favorite indian restaurant in Phoenix. The food is very flavorful & rich..",4
"I went to Otaku today for lunch with 5 of my girlfriends.  I think the prices were fair for lunch and the food was pretty good, but the service was horrible.  She was slow with very few tables and at times, seemed bothered.  After our food was delivered, she never came back at all, not even for drink or water refills.  I don't want to dis the place as it is a very pretty joint and I would return hoping for a more attentive server.",2
"Have you ever had a party, and needed like, a lot of random things for it? This is your spot. They have EVERYTHING: Mardi Gras beads, tableware, Pittsburgh sports goodies, weird plastic babydolls, I mean EVERYTHING. If Stefon from SNL ever featured a party store, this would be the place!\n\nPrices are good: on my most-recent visit, I managed to get supplies for party giftbags for 70 people for only $70 bucks. Pretty awesome!\n\nDo you want to throw a Halloween party? How about a cowboy party? How about a Hawaiian NASCAR bachelorette party on St. Patrick's Day? You can totally pull that off with the help of Feinberg's!\n\nAnd in the event that you can't find just what you're looking for, the staff is super helpful and will go out of their way to get you what you need.\n\nSomething to note: you can only use a credit card if you spend more than $10, so if you're just buying a few things, bring cash. They're open on Saturdays, so it can become part of your normal Strip District stroll!",3
it was okay.....small place but the food was good....large portions....,1
"Surely you jest. If your idea of thai food is something straight out of a microwave that was not well-prepared in the first place, where you can feel claustrophobic and listen to neighborhood billybobs talk about beer and such, then this is the place for you.\nTypical for Avondale, yes. Worth the frustration, no.",0
This is one of those cases where I would give -10 stars if I could.  I would consider the service department to be thieves especially Alex.  Had my car towed their after it was completely dead after replacing a battery for a second time within a few months.  Alex informs me that in order to even perform a diagnostic I need a new battery for $200 because a charge alone won't give it enough to do this.  I'm no mechanic but how can a dealership not jump it or doesn't have a battery lying around to test it.  Since the batter was brand new and still under warranty this didn't seem right to me so I had it towed elsewhere.  \n\nWhen I arrived to pick it up lo and behold he drove what I thought was a car that couldn't hold a charge around to the front of the service department.  WTF!  He also tried to charge me for a diagnostic which I never agreed to since they said they couldn't do it without my purchasing a new battery.  \n\nAfter the car was towed to what will be my forever mechanic now for my Beetle he said I don't understand why the dealership couldn't see that simple fix and the battery is fine and doesn't need replacing.   All that was wrong was loose battery cables.  And on top of that he charged me nothing.  \n\nFindlay NV has lost a customer for life and I will warn everyone I know to stay away from this Stealership!\n\nETA:  While I appreciate James C responding I don't see how it is relevant because my battery was never dead or bad in the first place.  Since having it towed to a reputable mechanic I have been driving the car ever since without incident.  I am just glad they didn't get my $200 and whatever else they might have tried to charge in addition to that had I let them keep my car.,0
"Pizza is always pretty good and timely. I order late night because I work nights. But this is the second time I've ordered chicken wings and they are 2 for 2 as the worst wings (hands down) that I've ever eaten. Fatty, soggy, barely able to calls themselves chicken...wings. If you're looking for \""food\"" just order anything except the chicken wings. They make the least pickiest of eaters (me) want to ralph.",1
"I'm not sure if I get more excited about any other restaurant in Las Vegas, than I do for Hot N Juicy!  This place is amazing!  You can't be a prissy girl and eat at Hot N Juicy.  You are going to get your hands filthy in the most amazing sauces ever, you will not have silverware or even a plate, but rather a plastic table cloth- and you will smell as though you bathed in the garlicky goodness that is the Hot N Juicy sauce!  \n\nI live and breathe for the Hot N Juicy Special- SPICY Snow Crab Legs!! They are my true guilty pleasure!! I always get at least a pound or two and a side of Cajun Fries with extra seasoning, and wash it all down with their super inexpensive beers in a frosty mug.  \n\nI would, and could eat here at least once a week and never get sick of it.  They have a large variety of seafood (and chicken!) so there is something for everyone..",4
"The prices here are EXTREMELY reasonable.  For 2 vaccines, the exam, and antibiotics my total came to $45.00.  Far less than anywhere else I looked. And I was seen at my appointment time.

I'm very pleased to have found such a great vet so close to home.",4
"Devoid of atmosphere, but that is the same for all airport pubs. \n\nWhy am I giving it three stars, you might then ask. Well it's the beer!\n\nThey have an excellent array of craft beers, Rogue, Brooklyn, Goose Island to name just a few.  On top of that it is comfortable and clean and a good stop as you wait excitedly for your plane to arrive to take you to sunnier lands. The best bar at  this airport by far.",2
More of a 3.5. An endless menu of delicious chocolate-related confections of relatively good quality. A little on the pricey side though.,2
"This restaurant now has new owners and the quality has gone from decent (with the previous owner) to pathetic (with the new owner).  Then entire staff quit within a month of the place changing hands and now, 3/4 of the eating area has been cordoned off leaving only about 5 booths open to eat at.  The entire place is run by the sole owner (both serving and cooking)... he has scared off both staff and customers.  Terrible, terrible, terrible.  It's only a question of time before this long-standing restaurant closes.  Too bad.",0
"Ive been hoping that this would be my \""goto\"" place for a Sonoran style hot dog in the Phoenix area, sadly it wont be.  Tucson still owns Phoenix in that category.   The actual bacon wrapped dog was \""just there\"".  The bun (bread) was respectable since they didn't use a hot dog bun, but a tad stale.  The toppings were weak.  Chopped, raw, white onion?  Where are the butter laden grilled ones?  Also, the pico tasted mass produced, store bought garbage.   Big let down.   \n\nI also got a burger and really expected it to be great judging by the wall of mesquite smoke that hits you when you enter Bueno Burger.  Very average burger at best.  It's nice that you can customize your burger ala Five Guys for free, but I couldn't taste the mesquite in the meat.   \n\nThis place has a lot of potential, but it's lacking on the most important factor being flavor.  Until then, it's a roadie to El Guero Canelo for my hot dogs estilo Sonora fix.",1
"If you're a health freak, I'd advise you to stay away from Fat Sandwich Company. Otherwise, if you're down to coat the linings of your stomach with fatty oils, do a little damage to your cholesterol, and have the capacity to fit clogged arteries once in a while, this place will do just that for you.\n\nThis menu items here are unconventional. Imagine a big hot dog bun, filled with things such as fries, mozzarella sticks, chicken nuggets, onion rings, beef patties, bacon, ham, egg, mayo, ranch, ketchup, etc. Gross, right? Well, once in a while you just got to put your guilty conscience aside and set the fireworks in your stomach. Fat Sandwich Company can provide the perfect venue for that. Just go for a long run the day after. I wouldn't advise doing it right after your meal as you'll get pretty darn full.\n\nYou live life only once. You might as well try their monster challenge... It's as big as a standard NFL football. Finish it by yourself and you get it free.",2
"They give you a lot of gelato for a single. However, the flavors are just okay. I would expect more from Bellagio. The tiramisu gelato had too big chunks of lady fingers that just over powered the smoothness of the gelato. It would be better if the ladyfingers had been soaked in espresso prior.",1
nice selection of flavors. my personal preference are the dairy free choices. toppings are fresh. love coming here for a sweet treat.,4
"This is a great place if you are not looking to go to a club but want good music, good drinks and want to smoke some hookah!  \nService is always on top of their game!  They see a drink low, they come ask if you want more and they deliver fast!  They are a little overpriced and the drinks arent that strong, but thats usually the case for anyplace you go. They have an outdoor bar and an indoor bar.  If you are indoor, sometimes you are lucky enough to get to see live music!  They had a great band that played some awesome tunes.  The hookah is $30, I think that is a little over priced, I usually you only pay about $20.",3
"Can't beat their late hours menu!  Food for like $5.  I didn't want to dine in and ask for take out so we can take our food up to the room and be comfortable eating while watching some tv.  So we still sat at a table ordered our food, and as soon as it came we got to go boxes.",2
"I've been to the one in NYC and this one is pretty much the same. It's a 4-story building filled with everything imaginable with an M&M logo on it. You'll find clothing, kids toys, home goods, and lots of candy! There is a little movie up on the top floor, but it was closed when we were here. Definitely a fun store and if you brought your kids to sin city, they will enjoy stopping in here.",2
"When this place first opened it was great! I found myself coming back again and again for more. The lunch dishes and smoothies were great. As time went on food quality went down hill a bit. Last time I went for breakfast was terrible. Eggs were cold and potatoes were soggy. If anything I recommend their sandwiches or wraps. They are pretty good, priced a little high for what they are but not bad for a quick lunch on the go.",1
"Great little, family oriented gym.  Terrific value. This gym does not offer classes or any amenities like a pool or showers.  However, it's very reasonably priced, clean and the staff is great.    I go to this gym for my regular workouts since it's close to home and the personal training is solid and well priced.  Two things: this gym could definitely use better ventilation in back of the gym which has low ceilings. Also, paper towel dispensers and sanitizer in the public areas of the gym should replace the yucky the single cloth towel that exists to clean the equipment before/after your workout.",2
Went on a Thursday night. It wasn't crowded at all. I got in through a promoter and girls get open bar from 1030-11:30pm which was awesome! The vibe of the place is pretty cool and the outdoor patio has an amazing view!\n\nIt started to get progressively crowded but my friends and I decided to go elsewhere. The music was alright and im sure with different djs there are different vibes.,2
"I normally do not like going to filipino restaurants because I've been to many and it just isn't like home cooked food.  \n\nI decided to go to Fiesta Filipina because it's just a block away from my work and I had to have that filipino food fix.\n\nOMG, this is the first time I had filipino food that tasted like it was home cooked.  I loved it!  The sinigang was awesome!  The BBQ Pork was to die for!  The pork adobo was yummy!\n\nI loved it!

"Service: No\nFood: Good\nAmbiance: Fantastic\n\nWe ordered:\n\nEggplant Parmigiana flatbread\nroasted roma tomato, caramelized onions, fresh buffalo mozzarella, \ngarlicky bread crumbs, pistachio basil pesto.....18\n\n- The flatbread was pretty good. Considering I don't eat veggies, I dug this. This is green eggplant not purple, which threw my mom off. Was a little greasy but still good.\n\nPorterhouse Steak \ncrispy fried lobster mac & cheese, shiraz demi glaze, butter braised broccoli, red pepper pur\u00e9e.....56\n\n- Ordered medium-well and it came out fairly rare. The demit glaze was amazing and the steak was very, very tender almost falling off the bone. The lobster mac n cheese was ice cold (probably sitting around waiting for the steak). One of the men standing around noticed my discontent and attempted to fix the situation by offering to bring out a warm side and he did, however he brought out the wrong side. Crab cake!! And it was bomb. Not right but nice effort.\n\nRainbow Trout, came with Brussel Sprouts risotto? and something else.. $38?\n\n- Mom got the special for the day and enjoyed her meal greatly. She said she wished there were more brussel sprouts.\n\nBill ended up being $163 before tip. Not bad. Two entrees, the flatbread as an app, two glasses of wine and dessert. I was expecting it to end up being about $230 without tip.\n\nConsidering how many people I send here a week and how much they all pay for dinner I was expecting service to be top notch. It was not. My server was less than attentive. I think he was either trying to get laid or get a big tip from the six top of chicks sitting a few tables away. I decided to bring my mother out to a nice dinner and the service was lacking. My mothers been a waitress herself for 25+ years and I myself work in the industry (Concierge at a SISTER PROPERTY) and we both thought the server sucked. I don't think I'll be back despite how good the food was.\n\nOh and the server ended up getting screwed because his party of six all wanted seperate checks and paid with credit cards. Karma for you buddy!",2
"This is our second time here.  This place was just as good as the last time we were here.  It started with our waiter Rishad.  He was nice and very quick.  He made sure we left the restaurant satisfied.  Even his manager came by to see if we were enjoying the experience.\n\nThe meal started with their Q-Rolls.  Seasoned beef brisket with a BBQ dipping sauce and a chipotle dip.  They are always great.\n\nAggie ordered Smoasted chicken (smoked. & roasted) with BBQ.  Her sides were Mac and cheese and mashed potatoes.  She enjoyed it very much.\n\nI ordered Beef brisket with Ranch Beans and mashed potatoes.  It was very, very good.  I enjoyed every bit.  \n\nMikaela ordered the Kid's Cheeseburger with fries.  I took a bit of her cheeseburger, and the beef tasted better than anything from other burger places.  I couldn't believe it.  \n\nTo drink, Mikaela ordered their sweet tea (best I have tasted from any restaurant), and Aggie and I ordered Frosted Lemonades.  They were tart and sweet, and sugar coated the glass.  That was a nice touch.\n\nWe will definitely come back here.  It is just epic!",4
"Okay, so maybe it's against the law to have wine with a burger, but I don't usually follow the rules.  I had no choice here, where it's beer first, last and always.  Or a milkshake, which I haven't had since 1983 (so how come I'm not skinny?)   I would have preferred a Riesling, and even would have settled for a lowly white zinfandel.  Ix-nay on either.  Strike One for my first visit here.\n\nSo I won't drink, and I'll have coffee instead.  \""Yes, it's fresh,\"" the waitress answered.  \""Ah, but do you have milk for it.\""  \""No, just cream.\"" (See 1983 above). Strike Two.\n\nStrike Three came close to happening.  I ordered the mushroom and cheddar burger with a salad on the side.  I was about to throw in the towel after the waitress said the dressing was a lemon vinaigrette, which I'd love to love, but most vinaigrettes are too tangy for my delicate Princess mouth.  She saved the day by offering to let me have ranch, and I got the feeling she was doing me a favor because of the first two strikes.  Oh, she was very pleasant about it, but I just sensed this wasn't in the script.\n\nThe burger was excellent, but almost rare, instead of the medium I ordered.  I like rare hamburgers, but the Food Police tell me not to eat them.  It didn't have a lot of the cheddar, which was fine with me, and the mushrooms were fresh and plentiful.  My husband had the same thing, and enjoyed his.  One friend ordered the turkey burger, and the other had the ahi tuna.  They loved them both.  We also shared a basket of the sweet potato fries, not usually high on my list, but these were delicious and not greasy or oversalted.\n\nWould I go back?  Probably, as long as I remember to bring my hip flask.",2

"Mesa's best kept secret, LJ's is a family owned pizza joint with I swear to you, the best pizza I've ever had, EVER.  And I know my pizza.  Seems simple I guess but they do it right and I'm not sure I can really explain it.  Regular to thinnish crust, not overbearing on sauce...  Dont go to LJs for the ambiance, theres not much to be had, but the service is good and you absolutely cant go wrong with the endless pizza and salad lunch buffet for around $8.  My favorite is 'shroom, but for you daredevil pizza eaters, look for tens of odd topping combinations including the pasta pizza.  If you HAVE to be in Mesa, you HAVE to be at LJ's.",4

National TV and I couldn't think of anything clever.

"This is one of my favorite spots in Phoenix. The pizza is wonderful, the pesto salad is absolutely amazing, and the fresh fruit crepe is delicious.

"I was FINALLY able to sit down and enjoy a meal here, and while the food didn't *quite* live up to my longstanding high expectations (um, have you tried their bread pudding?), it was good enough.\n\nWe started with the Guacamole and Sizzlin Peppers; the guacamole was flavorful with a hint of spice, but the accompanying salsas didn't so much compare. That's okay though, the guacamole was plentiful. The Sizzlin' Peppers were delish. So simple and understated yet SO good. A nice alternative to your standard deep fried peppers, these were grilled and stuffed with a three cheese variety that complimented the peppers wonderfully. Not to mention, the peppers were fiery hot...what a nice surprise for a girl who likes her heat. \n\nMy husband ordered the Sangria, which wasn't overly sweet (bonus!). It was a large glass and a deal at $7. \n\nFor entrees my husband ordered the Vegetarian sandwich sans portobello (why must all vegetarian sandwiches/wraps/entrees fall into the same realm of grilled vegetables? I make some mean vegetarian dishes at home that go way beyond the portobello). It arrived with the mushroom, no biggie, he just took it off. Otherwise it was a solid win: crusty ciabatta, melted jalapeno jack cheese, grilled grey squash and asparagus, finished with a pesto spread and balsamic reduction. The sandwich also came with a side of green chile posole (that I made him order), and while it was good, I was expecting a bit more spiciness and flavor. \n\nI ordered the North Central Chicken, served with a red chile glaze, roasted poblano creamed corn, grilled asparagus, and house mashed potatoes. The chicken itself was just okay. It was grilled perfectly, however I found the chile glaze to be overly sweet and taste more like barbeque sauce. The poblano creamed corn and house mashed potatoes were tasty, and the asparagus was nicely grilled as well. \n\nOf course we ordered the bread pudding for dessert (and ordered an extra to go, for our babysitters) and while I ate half at the restaurant and planned on eating the remainder for breakfast the next morning, I couldn't help myself and quickly ate the rest upon returning home. I am telling you - SO GOOD. Probably to die for.\n\nAll in all, it was a nice experience. The service was okay; our server wasn't the \""friendliest\"" so to say, but that's fine with me. Our drinks never went unfilled and our food arrived in a timely manner. While I much prefer the Southwestern cuisine from Rokerij or Dick's, I'll definitely be returning here for the bread pudding time and time again.",3
"Aria is a modern marvel. Anyone who appreciates innovation, technology, and ambience will love the Aria. I'm more of a shopper than a gambler so I spent more time in the retail spaces but I did spend enough time lounging in the casino area to be sufficiently impressed with the environment. Aria has a very distinct smell which I instantly loved and connected with. The ventilation system is state of the art and in addition to the normal system, each slot machine in the casino has a built in air filtration system which sucks in air in the immediate viscinity and filters it back out. I love the al fresco cafe at the pool but it was so hard to find my boyfriend and I nearly gave up before finally finding the entrance. The room itself was awesome. I won't go into details because so many others have, but the room greeting you is a nice touch. As my boyfriend said when we first entered \""I feel like I'm in the future.\"" \n\nThe spa is also awesome. I'm a spa fiend and was delighted to encounter new spa features. The spa at Aria features the Shio Salt room and the Ganbanyoku Beds, both of which were new to the spa experience for me. I loved the Ganbanyoku beds... just thinking about them relaxes me. One of the coolest features of this spa is the fact that it features multiple \""co-ed\"" areas where you can co-mingle with opposite sex companions.\n\nOverall the experience was spectacular and when I return to Vegas I will be staying here again.",4
I would probably not book with Rio ever again. Although they have a lot of slots and decent restaurants the room was outdated and we got charged an additional $20 per person which is a resort fee. I know it's up to luck but dam their machines were tight not even $20. Service was okay nothing outstanding.,1
"This place comes highly recommended within my little group of friends but Overall wasn't super impressed.  I ordered the tika masala chicken & it was super good one on the best flavored masala sauces I have eaten anywhere.  If only everything on the menu was this good.\n\nMy husband ordered goat.    It was mostly grissle and bones.  the little bit of edible meat was dry and tasteless.  \n\nNann is also dry and tasteless.\n\nPrices are expensive.  There is no buffet.  service is terrible (rude, sloppy, listless, and supper supper slow).",1
"Excellent food... but for the slow service\n\nWas excited to try Bouchon as a Thomas Keller fan.  To be upfront, Bouchon is no French Laundry.  The latter blew me away whereas, Bouchon was excellent but unremarkable.  \n\nI had the chicken and waffles, which were superb and the waffles threw me for a happy loop with the bacon specks cooked in and the flavored butter.  Other folks in our family had rave reviews for the Tartine de Thon, Bouchon French Toast, and trout dish.  Gravlax and Croque de Madame were said to be good.\n\nService staff was very nice, though remarkably slow in their execution.\n\nCouple criticisms: \n(1) Service was exceptionally slow!  Ordering took about 25 minutes.  It was about 50 minutes before food was on the table.  And paying was the equivalent of a race with your chunky buddy on your back.  All in all, our dining experience took about 2.5 hours.  \n(2) The Bouchon Pastry Basket was grocery store caliber.  Two of the flavors came back as unavailable.  Then, when the platter did arrive, they all had cold centers.  Seriously, for $13 for four pastries, I would expect thorough reheating.\n(3) We sat in the back right and with things taking so long, the sun was hitting us hard.  My cousin and I started eating lunch with our sunglasses on.  As the temperature on my phone crossed 90-degrees, I called over the staff and asked to either move or have them pull some kind of shade.  They kindly put an outside umbrella against the window which helped greatly.  They were very kind in responding.  I would have liked it more if they had thought ahead reacted to our discomfort without being asked.  We aren't the only ones who have eaten at the table.\n\nIn sum, excellent food, slow service, nice staff, a few knocks on food preparation, and a some small doubts on quality for the price.",3
"The place has been cleaned up lately, which is nice, but the real draw are the fish taco's.  It's the only thing I get there.  They are so good i'm afraid anything else just couldn't compare.  Put some extra cilantro, a squeeze of lime, and some tapatio hot sauce on them and you won't be let down.  It's best to go there for lunch and get the tacoholic special",4
Pita Cafe is great!  People are always friendly and the food is awesome.  I have gotten this for takeout 4-5 times now and it is very consistent and delicious.,4
"We went there for lunch last week...and we went very early by my standards- 11:15 AM.   Fifteeen minutes later, the place was jammed, and this was on a Tuesday.  I ordered the Mexican Pizza and the other person I was with ordered their famous Chile Relleno.    I enjoyed the chips that came out and the salsa wasn't too bad either.  We did have to wait a bit due to the time it takes to make the Chile Relleno.  \n\nAs far as the food, I enjoyed the Mexican Pizza-not only was it huge, it was very tasty.  I did not try the Chile Relleno-not my thing- but the other person enjoyed it as well.  It was incredibly large-it was easily larger than a football.\n\nI will probably go back at some point.  I'm not one for waiting in lines so when I do go back, I will go before 11:30 AM.",2
I go against the grain. I thought it was an amazingly salty place. I had my month worth of dietary sodium all in one sitting. Still don't know why if it is a steak place they don't ask how a customer prefers his meat like rare medium or well done.???,1
This place is lucky it is getting any stars.  I came here for my birthday and burger King would have been better. The managers could care less if the food is edible or not.  I told them and they did nothing for our party of 10 but basically say it was our fault for not telling them.  The menu is so limited now everything just sucks save your time and money go anywhere else literally.  This place should be burnt,0
"Came in with a group of six for lunch on a Sunday. Four arrived on-time; we were waiting on two to arrive, but were seated immediately.\nSubmitted our order to the waitress approximately 5-10 minutes after being seated.\n\n1. Pork and egg congee\n2. Dandan noodles\n3. 2x sichuan beef noodle soup\n4. dumpling noodle soup\n5. Beef (and peas) over rice with an over-easy egg\n6. Chicken Congee (to go)\n\nConclusions:\n*Food as a whole was delicious, but not particularly outstanding.\n*Service was not timely, and some dishes arrived as some of our friends finished theirs. (Namely the sichuan beef noodle soup)\n*Expect typical exorbitant Las Vegas mark-up on food. (Especially the dimsum)\n*Restaurant was very clean and provided a good seat for watching the big screens for sports betting.",1
Food was ok at best. It was warm but not hot. The house fried rice was very bland and none of the meats were seasoned at all. For 8 dollars just for a plate of rice I could have done better at home. My boyfriend liked his Mongolian beef but my teriyaki chicken was very standard and nothing special. If you want better food and better prices go to golden Wei at bell and cotton,1
"This place was okay. It's not bomb nor is it bad. We were really hungry so we rushed into this place and tried a few dishes. They have kimchi as an appetizer.. They had the peppered beef noodle which was decent. If you want decent food and want an experience that will blow your mind, you don't want to eat inside of LVH.",2
The staff are friendly. The waiting room is very clean. The diagnose was accurate and honest with a list of suggestion of services. There is no pressure. I will go back.,4
"1.) crinkle cut fries!?!? come on, this reminds me of microwavable crinkle cut fries i used to eat back in the late 80's. makes the meal seem so cheap.\n\n2.) the chicken is actually very good quality. definitely fresh. i dont like the batter and the turd like shapes.\n\n3.) their texas toast is pretty good. could use a little more flavor though.\n\n4.) slaw... its slaw...\n\n5.) lemonade + unsweetened tea = arnold palmer. i love it, its the tits.\n\n6.) cane sauce? its just fry sauce with Worcestershire sauce and pepper. it tastes so one dimensional.\n\n7.) for the price of a 3 piece its expensive.\n\n8.) the only reason why its good cus my MOMMY BOUGHT IT FOR ME!",1
"ABSOLUTELY LOVE THIS PLACE. Open Late night, fast service, friendly staff. BEST Curry in town and great location. Definitely my late night go-to Spot.",4
"It is a lovely spa with attractive decor, and they offer a great range of services. I loved the spa manicure I got, but I was disappointed with the facial. While the aesthetician was gentle and did a fairly thorough job with the extractions, there was no steaming beforehand. Also, she left the room for 15 minutes while the facial mask was on. In my previous experiences at other spas, when a mask is placed on the face, the aesthetician gives a neck/shoulder massage or a hand massage until it is time for the mask to be removed. Considering the high price of a facial at this spa, I expect the aesthetician to stay to work on me the entire session. I would go back to the spa for a pedicure but not for a facial.",2
"What a bummer, service was minimal, food was eh.  I had been to Cafe Pino once before and after tonight, I won't be coming back. \nCame in for dinner with a girlfriend.  I met her there and got there about 15 min early so I decided to sit down in a booth.  The restaurant had one party inside and 2 on the patio. Place was dead.  Well, it was a Wednesday night.  The booth seats are close to being ripped apart.  They were all cracked. Glad I was wearing jeans, if I was wearing a skirt or shorts I know that seat would have been uncomfortable.  So I was seated by an employee and waited for 12 minutes to get someone to come to my table to ask if I wanted a drink or water.  My friend showed up and a it took another 5 minutes for a server to come to the table to see if she wanted a drink. She ordered a glass of wine.... Oh, they are all out of that kind.  It's a Wednesday and the place is empty, how can you be out of a certain kind of wine?!  We were given 2 menus.  One was the specials that was a front and back laminated that looked to be printed with a home printer in Times New Roman and the other menu looked to be professionally printed.  It was just confusing.  My girlfriend had been there a couple of times before and these specials were the same ones.  We did get bread with oil and vinegar.  Bread was nothing to brag about, it was flat and hard.  We both ordered the Pasta Tuscan with chicken. She ordered hers spicy.  Which was not.  But she said she liked it. I enjoyed mine as well.  While we were having dinner we kept hearing this banging.  We looked around thinking we would find a kid making the noise like banging a booster seat.  Come to find out it was an employee sweeping into a dust pan. This was around 8:30  and there were more people in the restaurant.  The acoustics in the restaurant are not great so everything echoes and having this employee making noise was annoying as hell.  He stopped for a bit then he started up again.  We looked at the dessert menu and the server gave a couple recommendations.  I asked what flavors the gelato was and he said it is a surprise.  But if I had an allergy to let him know. We ordered cookies and cream, server said its a warm chocolate chip cookie with ice cream.  It was 3 hard chocolate chip cookies with nuts (glad I didn't have a peanut allergy).  It also had chocolate, vanilla and a chocolate chip gelato. The gelato was very good.  The hard over cooked cookies eh, could have done without.  Should have been a warm soft cookie to go with the gelato. While we are eating our dessert, with other customers in the restaurant, the employees are putting the chairs on top of the tables. \nBang, bang, bang.... that employee is sweeping again. He was sweeping around us , I thought he was going to ask for us to put our feet up to clean underneath the table. Dude!?!?! It's loud, do that when your customers leave!!!! We paid the bill and at 9:40, the lights went bright, ok ok we get it, you want us to leave.  I felt like we were in a club at closing time and they turn the lights on to tell people to leave. \n4 stars for the pasta dish and gelato and no stars for service, bread and hard cookies.  Learn to give your customers a good experience!",1
over priced! not worth service! was not happy with color at all.,0
"A great selection of breakfast dishes...I didn't know what to choose.  We had to wait about 10 minutes to be seated, which was fine. Service was good and wait staff was friendly.  I had the blueberry bacon pancakes and they were soooo good!  All three of my kids had clean plates as well.  My husband got the crazy biscuits (I think that was the name of it) and he said it was delicious.  My sister-in-law got pumpkin pancakes and she was a fan.  We plan to go again as we want to try more of their menu.\n\nWe say inside, however they have a nice large patio.  The restaurant is really cute inside and has a nice warm feel.  You can even dine in a car!\n\nOverall a great place!  We will be back!!",3
"Overpriced, mediocre food. Bland atmosphere. Completely out of place and awkward feeling. Peculiar Rabbit is what happens when you have no vision of what you want to do, but decide to try and capitalize on the success of other businesses in an area. None-the-less, considering who owns it, I'm sure they will spend all the money they can to try and turn it into the go to spot... Even if people only begrudgingly go there.\n\nCase in point: After a dismal turnout for their first 2 months, they decided to start paying $2500 a month to buy up 210 parking spots (far more than necessary for a business of this size) that were previously used for free community parking for all businesses in the area. Now, these spots have been turned into $5 premium parking spots. As a reward to anyone who pays $5, you get a $5 credit at Peculiar Rabbit! Nice, right? No, because you can't just swing by for a drink and get back your money... They expect you to build up a $50 tab at their overpriced restaurant first, before getting that $5 credit. Needless to say, the $50 catch isn't posted on the signs when you pull into the paid parking area. This is the bait and switch mentality of a failed business idea being forced upon a thriving neighborhood.\n\nNone-the-less, find some free parking and check out some of the great bars and restaurants in the area who don't need to turn their customers upside down and shake them to get a couple bucks. For breakfast / brunch, I suggest checking out Zada Janes, Bistro La Bon, or Soul. For lunch / dinner, I suggest Midwood Smokehouse, Soul, Dish, Diamond, Fuel Pizza. For drinks, check out Elizabeth Billiards, Twenty Two, Common Market, Thirsty Beaver, Snug Harbor.\n\nDon't waste your time here.",0
it's wendy's gross!!!\n\nhaha the place looks great after the update. Layout is terrible actually doesn't really work efficiently when ordering and getting food when its crowded. Just backs up all awkwardly..\n\n\nthe food is the same so guess what...i won't be back...\n\nonly yelping this because its a check in and i hate seeing things i need to review when i sign on.,0
Good place to eat. Hate getting charged for extra ranch and sauce.,3
We sat with menus for breakfast and lunch...  Everyone decided on breakfast and when the rude waiter came to us he said we could\nNot get breakfast because it ended three minutes ago!  The kitchen was filled with breakfast when I walked past it coming to my table...  I mean why give us a damn breakfast menu?!?!  Idiots!!  I'm not coming back here again...  Idiots!  If I want pancakes at 2pm give me pancakes!  How f*#%^ hard is that to do for any kitchen?!,0
"I really wanted to like this place. It' got a dark, quirky atmosphere that reminded me of a little hick bar up in the mountains.   We had heard about it from a friend, and the reviews were pretty good, so we thought we'd try it for lunch a few Fridays ago.  I guess our first mistake was not getting the fish- that's what they are famous for.  But we had gotten the zucchini/mushroom basket and didn't care for the breading (too greasy) so we figured the fish wouldn't be all that great.  I ordered the rueben sandwich, and all I can say is it was the strangest one I've ever had.  I don't know if it's because the grill might not have been clean or what, but the meat tasted exactly like a shredded hot dog.  I know that sounds weird, but that's the best description I have for it.  But the beer was ice cold, and the waitress was feisty, so that scores a couple of points in my book.",1
"We ate here with friends after they saw Wicked Spoon on the Travel Channel.  I read reviews saying there were long lines and up to a 2 hour wait, but on a Saturday night at about 5:30 pm (we went early before an 8pm show), there was no line at all.  \n\nFor $41/person (or $50 if you want unlimited red or white house wine), you get a wide variety of delicious \""small plates\"".  My guy got the unlimited wine, but the server was not very attentive, so we really paid $9 for two glasses of wine.  Not terrible, but still, we were there long enough that she should have at least offered a refill 4 times. \n\nThe food was mostly fabulous! Almost everything is in a small bowl, cup, plate, Chinese take out box, pot or pan.  Very cute presentation.  Bone Marrow! I've never had bone marrow, but it was delicious! Duck Ravioli with a delicious creamy sauce; Fried Mozzarella Risotto Balls; Wild Boar Sloppy Joe Sliders; shot glasses with shrimp cocktail and ceviche; a wide variety of special salads (I had the roasted beet salad - yum!).  Seared salmon with parsnip puree, BBQ shrimp with white cheddar grits.  They also had a fabulous fruit, cheese, and charcuterie display.  Delicious Maytag bleu cheese, brie, something semi-hard with a coating of espresso, prosciutto, olives, marinated fancy mushrooms with focaccia and burrata cheese; hand pulled and rolled mozzarella.  My mouth is watering just recounting all the delicousness!\n\nThere was also buffet basics, like chilled crab legs (same as almost any buffet) and prime rib (delicious!)  They also have a wide array of desserts, with a huge selection of sorbet and gelato. Best, creamiest, loveliest gelato I've ever tasted! \n\nOverall, a great deal for amazing tastes.  You definitely have to try Wicked Spoon at the Cosmopolitan!",3
"Calistro is currently celebrating their 1 year anniversary. You can get any small salad, entree and dessert for $30 per person.\n\nMy husband and I took advantage of this and were very glad we did.\nI tried the Beet Salad - organic beet's, farmer's cheese, almonds, fresh orange and fennel pollen. It was delicious....the farmer's cheese was amazingly creamy and tasty and worked very well with the beets. My husband had the soup of the day which he said was very tasty.\n\nFor the entree I tried the crab cakes - red crab meat, wood roasted organic vegetables, baby greens, preserved lemon, tarragon.....this was unbelievably good! Highly recommend.\nMy husband had the filet mignon - all natural local beef, fingerling potatoes, roasted cauliflower, caramelized onions and tamarind bearnaise......he devoured it and loved it!\n\nAs usual the staff were wonderful....very helpful and knowledgeable. Don't miss this special : )",4
"Since we live right near here we finally broke down and ordered from here.  Pretty good pizza.  I appreciated that it was NY style.  Delivery went good.  Pizza was tasty, and probably worth a repeat!\n\nI also stopped in one day when coming home from the gym and got a sandwich to go.  Pretty good stuff as well.  Noticed that they had plenty of tables and dining room for a night out.  \n\nGlad we have you El Mirage Mario's!",3
"I've heard great things about this place for sometime, so finally decided to make some reservations and try it out.\n\nWe went on a Thursday night and it was pretty packed.  Standard Country Club/Steakhouse decor, very cowboy/wild west.  Casual attire is fine here, as we were WAY overdressed.\n\nThe host was a bit snippy but aside from the interaction with her, the rest of the evening was delighful.  \n\nThe menu had a good selection.  For our app we got the seafood platter.  Oysters, lobster tail, crab legs, and jumbo prawn.  Everything was halved and nighly prepared with a selection of dipping sauces and lemon.\n\nMy bf got the 12oz NY Strip and I have never seen a man enjoy a steak as much as he did.  He usually enjoys a better cut of steak but craving something different and he was impressed.  He got the Blue cheese butter to go with it and raved about this steak for days.\n\nI got the 6 oz filet medium and it was cooked perfectly.  The accompaniments were the cream of spinach and the twice baked potato and it was just amazing.\n\nFor desert we tried the Strawberry Rhubarb cobbler with basil gelato and it was delightful.  \n\nThe service was outstanding and really helpful and we never went without.  Great experience.",3
"It had been awhile since I'd been to a Lone Star and I really had no memories of the experience, so a few friends and I decided to try it out as it was the nearest steakhouse to our location.\n\nWe were extremely disappointed. Although the service was just fine and the bread & cheese fries were tasty, the rest of the food was either wholly unremarkable or completely unsatisfactory.\n\nI ordered the 8 oz. sirloin (so cold and purple throughout that it could walk off the plate on its own; I know, go ahead and make a face...), with saut\u00e9ed mushrooms and a house salad (no onions, extra ranch dressing) as my sides.\n\nThe salad was very plain and had nothing about it to distinguish it from any other salad anywhere (including one you would make at home or one that you would get from any buffet salad bar anywhere in the nation). I did not expect the salad to be the highlight of the meal, but usually there is something (a spiced up ranch dressing, flavored croutons, etc) that add to uniqueness of a 'house' salad. Not this time. Meh.\n\nWhen my entr\u00e9e showed up, the steak was warm, light pink throughout, rubbery, and absolutely flavorless. No rub, no marinade, and the cut had clearly either been recently frozen or sitting in a fridge for an extended period of time because the flavor of oxidation was rife. Please note that I never expect there to be marinades or rubs on a steak, but then I do expect the cut to stand up on its own (which it did not in this case).\n\nThe saut\u00e9ed mushrooms were particularly disappointing. I love saut\u00e9ed mushrooms. Adore them. I require nothing more than a little butter or oil on them and then just go to town in that pan! The mushrooms I received were a mix of mushrooms that had been saut\u00e9ed to the point of shriveled brown lumps and those that had been held over a warm microwave for 15 seconds. On top of this odd culinary spectrum, there seemed to be nothing but water on them, which didn't do anything to assist in the flavor. A quarter through the meal, I'd had enough and claimed a full tummy (a white lie... forgive me).\n\nAlthough the server was kind and competent, the food was a severe let down and I would never return to this or any other location. Sorry, Lone Star.",0
"I have no idea who runs this place, but I've never been disappointed.\n\nI used to work in the Galleria Corporate Center, and would come downstairs to visit Conmigo from time to time. \n\nThe smoothies are tasty. Not necessarily the healthiest. I feel like they are packed with sugar.\n\nThe salads are nice. When you ask for the dressing on the side, they happily oblige. The chicken is moist, and juicy. Like a nice....piece of chicken.\n\nMy only gripe...is the service can be a touch slow. I didn't knock them down any stars for this because it's not their fault for being understaffed. There needs to be another Conmigo in the building. \n\nAll in all....good times, good food.",3
"We came to watch a UFC fight here while in Vegas the last time.\nWe had sadly already eaten dinner, not realizing that the fight started at 7:00pm PST (usually we're thinking 10:00pm EST and forgot about the time change).  It was a Saturday night though, and we were interested in going to a bar, relaxing wtih some drinks and having a good time for several hours.\n\nThe waitress told us that to sit and watch the fight it was a $25pp minimum food spend.  I explained that we just ate, and there was no way that we would eat $25 of food each, but could we order drinks and appetizers?  We would definitely spend over $50 total.  She spoke to the manager, who put her foot down and said - no, that we needed to spend $25pp on food, if not, we would just be charged the $25.  (this after we had already started ordering)\n\nThis policy made no sense.  As a restaurant/bar they make more money on the booze than food ($12 drink with $4 worth of alcohol)....Instead of saying $25pp food minimum spend, why not say $25pp minimum spend on anything - or a flat cover charge of $15?  They would come out better overall doing either of those... Other bars that we've seen UFC events at charge a cover charge - and have a big room set aside for people watching the fight. \n\nAs a side note, people who said they were not watching the fight were still seated in areas where they could see it.  I wonder if they were charged the same?\n\nAnyways, so we ordered 2 dinner platters to go (since we would be charged anyways), and then ordered drinks.  The mixed drinks were truly terrible.  Lowest quality alcohol mixed with random sweet syrupy mess.  One of my drinks so was strong that I couldn't even drink it.  I had to go get more soda to water it down.  \n\nService was extremely slow.  At one point I choked on a tortilla chip and needed some water (we never received glasses of water) - so I had to walk all the way to the front of the restaurant to ask for some!  (the restaurant is quite deep so this took some time!)\n\nWaitress was completely absent.  It was a very busy night for them, I'm sure, but management needs to have more people working the tables to make sure people are happy.  We probably would have ordered more drinks if a waitress would've been there to ask if we wanted any!  They advertise having great bartenders who do tricks and whatnot, but I never saw one - and the drinks I ordered were not made by competant bartenders. \n\nOverall they just seemed completely disorganized in regards to handling a UFC event.  \n\n2 stars simply for the fact that we got a table near a tv screen, the food ended up being edible, and because it wasn't over $100 per person.  \""Meh I've had better\"" (2 stars) describes my feelings perfectly.",1
"Ok, so we knew the chef and he hooked us up with a huge sampling of the best of everything (no exaggeration!).  But I think that even if we paid full price, and only got to try a few of their appetizers and one Paella, I still would be giving Imagine Spain 5 stars.\n\nIt was really slow, and I felt sorry for the staff ... they seemed bored ... so all of you yelpers, go check out Imagine Spain.  It's delicious and more importantly, unique.  That's sometimes hard to find with the mass of cookie-cutter restaurants around here....",4
Service was awful and sushi was just so so.  I prefer Social House in Crystals.  Won't be back.,1
These donuts are over priced and the quality doesn't justify the cost...not mention the owner of this business has publicly announced his dislike for the rights of the LGBT community. The full article can be found here - http://www.pghcitypaper.com/pittsburgh/the-hole-story/Content?oid=1342790 It maybe old news as of this update (11/6/2014) but I still feel strongly about a local business alienating a large sector of the Pittsburgh population. There are too many other local businesses that make some damn tasty treats and they don't discriminate against the LGBT community. Go check out Bartram House Bakery! Best cake and boston creme donut you'll get.,0
"So we are from South Carolina where there are many Moe's restaurants. After almost a year of living in Vegas we have desperately missed the \""Welcome to Moe's\"" when you walk in the door and the taste of their yummy quest dip. We are glad we can now go anytime we want I Downtown Summerlin.",4
"I DO NOT recommend you go here. In April 2011 I started seeing small blisters on the bottom of my feet and hands. My feet were itchy and I started to develop painful cracks on the soles of my feet. I didn't have health insurance so I put up with the cracks and pain for a few months. The cracks worsened and I developed some sort of infection. I was starting to see many blisters and the cracks were more severe. A friend of mine recommended I see Dr. Racette so I made an appointment. After almost an hour minute wait, Dr. R. examined my feet for a few seconds and diagnosed pustular psoriosis. He filled out a lot of paperwork, prescribed a topical steroid and asked me to come back in for a follow up in a week. \n\nA week later, my feet were worse and had more cracks on them, making it difficult to walk. Dr. Racette had a student with him, stared at his paperwork and talked with his student. NOT ONCE did he make eye contact with me. He confirmed his initial diagnosis of pustular psoriosis and proceeded to fill out more paperwork. He wrote me another prescription for the topical steroid and left the room.\n\nOver the next few weeks my feet got so bad I couldn't wear shoes and could harldy walk. My feet were swollen and turning purple. The purple was spreading to my ankles. There were even more blisters on my feet and some on my hands. I was miserable and in a great deal of pain. I made another appointment to see Dr. R. He told me about a study he was working on and if I got accepted to it, I could have humira shots for free. I was accepted and given two shots in my stomach. The next day I had hives all over my body. The cracks on my feet were so bad I couldn't put my feet on my bed to sleep. I had to sleep with a pillow under my ankles to elevate them. Dr. R recommended I double up on the humira, even though I told him I had hives all over. After two more shots and a few more weeks, I could not stand the pain any longer. I literally wanted to die!\n\nThe infection was spreading from my feet  and had moved up past my ankles. It looked like I had purple socks. I called Dr. R. and he said there wasn't much he could do for me without insurance. I stopped the humira shots and called another doctor, also recommended by a friend. The other doctor was very nice, did not spend the entire time filling out paperwork, looked at me while he talked, listened to me with genuine concern, asked questions, had a wonderful \""bedside manor\"" and immediately prescribed antibiotics and a topical steroid. The purple started to fade after two days and the cracks and itchiness lessened. After two doses of antibiotics the infection was finally gone. Dr. Racette never prescribed antibiotics.\n\nIt took a year for the purple to fade. I still have psoriosis on my feet, but it's managable and much less severe. I do not recommend Dr. Racette, but I will give you the name of the wonderful doctor if you want.",0
"Came here for some drinks after a rehearsal dinner. I can't speak about the food but the bartender and service was great. I expected a Friday night in downtown Charlotte to be busy and hard to get drinks but it wasn't that hard. Yes, it was busy but the bartenders were on top of it. They seemed to get to each person quickly and made the drinks quickly. I was very impressed. The drink prices seems on par for what you would expect  as well. I liked it and the atmosphere of the bar.",4
"I don't believe I ate the same food as some of the other reviewers... I knew something was up when they didn't ask us how we wanted our burgers cooked (which seems to be a trend here in Scotland), and they came to us completely overcooked. Just a mass of gray tasteless meat with some random stuff on it. The coleslaw was watery and had a weird fishy taste. The fact that the same owners have a number of restaurants serving the same things \nin the city means that they've unfortunately cornered the Edinburgh burger market. Two stars only for the beer selection.",1
You can't beat it for the prices and they have specials most every day.  Sometime its just amazing and other times it's just OK.  But when two people can eat for less than $8.00 its not a bad joint.,2
"I've only been here 3 times, but lthe night of the Gavin Degraw concert (love him! hehe ;) ) was my first time at the pool area. \n\nIt was freakin' gorgeous and not crowded w/ drunktards! (excuse my language, but you know that's true with pools on The Strip) I'm a local and I appreciate that it looked like a pool resort at the strip without being on The Strip, AND.... w/ out obnoxiously drunk tourist. There's one huge round pool, a couple smaller ones and jacuzzis near the concert stage area, a bar called the Sandbar with gambling tables. No long lines or long wait to get in to the bathrooms. \n\nThere's a huge grass/lawn whatever you wanna call it in front of the concert stage. which is nice. they have lounge chairs around the main pool, and they're pretty nice too and not like the regular white ones you see at every pool. It gives an 'island' relaxing feel to the pool area. Some are in the water so u can dip ur feet in. Fun fun. Perfect for Vegas summers. \n\nAnyways, this was my first time at one of the summer Revolution concerts at Red Rock. It rocked!!! (hehe small lame joke)\n\nAs for the rest of the casino, it's new (a few yrs old) so it's gorgeous. I've been to the buffet (it's decent), it's not crowded but  the last time I was there was 2-3 yrs ago. I'm out of \""the clubbing phase.\"" I've been to Cherry and the other lounge, I forgot what it's called, they're okay seems a better fit for the older crowd since I went with my aunties and uncles. Lol I know right?! Wth? But they like to get down too. Hehe.\n\n I'd say the best part of this resort is the pool. I should have took more pics of the pool so I could post it up but I was too busy enjoying myself at the free Gavin Degraw concert! \n\nIf it wasn't for Gavin Degraw being here, I would never be at this resort. I doubt he'll see this but I LOVE you Gavin! :)\n\nI'm looking forward to the rest of the concerts lined up for the summer at this pool. \n\nThe one con for me again is the distance, coming from east Henderson. but I'm the type that wouldn't mind traveling far for great quality and a funtastic experience!\n\nOh btw, thought I'd add this since it was hilarious, we saw and an older dude (white hair) wearing a shirt in bold lettering, 'MILF HUNTER'. I couldn't get a pic cuz he was rocking out just like the rest of us. Another great sober moment of the night. Only in Vegas!",3
"One nice thing about living back in the Las Vegas area is knowing I have the BEST Vet for my cat.  Dr. Terry Muratore is the most honest, compassionate vet that there is!  He has the same GREAT staff that stay there!  Why?  He's that damn good!  Terry's son Anthony works there as well.  It's a GREAT feeling to support a family run business.  Terry's honesty and integrity are an example for all to follow.  Today, I thought it was something MAJOR!  Terry took me back to show me my cat's X ray and explain everything to me!  In more than 35 years of dealing with vets, he is the ONLY one to do so!  How many vets make you wait, then just tell you what is wrong?  How do you really know?  Take your cat or dog to a vet you can TRUST!  They love your pets almost as much as you do!   It seems like they always have strays there to get adopted.  Do they have to do this?  No.  It's not a money thing where they try ripping you off.  They have pride in what they do!  Go to Legacy if you want the best.  If you try the rest, I wish you luck, you will need it!",4
Their customer service is terrible. I called for a quote and the guy told me to go with a different company.,0
We went out for a family brunch one Sunday. This place was great. Atmosphere was nice and the staff was amazing and friendly. The food was great too.,4
"Quaint little coffee shop with yummy sandwiches.  Of course, you're dealing with the vegas price of a sandwich but I found one of the most amazing tuna sandwiches that I have ever had. Just simple but the bread combo and fresh tuna was just superb!  Ideal for a coffee break after hitting the slots!",3
"Came here last Saturday after the Color Run. There was no line and now I know why. The food was awful, the portions were small, and the employees were talking about the customers in Spanish (I know because I'm fluent)! I'd give this place negative stars if I could. Needless to say, I will NOT be back.",0
"(Lyrics - Imagine Dragons - Radioactive)\n\nI'm ordering up shots and drinks\nI wipe my mouth as I eat the crust (pizza crust)\n\nI'm breathing in the aromatics\nI'm dining in, reviewing it, then checking out on the foodie bus\n\nThis is it, the EVO atmosphere\nYum!\n\nI'm eating up, I taste it in my mouth\nEnough to make my systems blow\nWelcome to the EVO, to the EVO\nWelcome to the EVO, to the EVO\nWhoa, oh, oh, oh, oh, whoa, oh, oh, oh, it's EVO Scottsdale, EVO Scottsdale\nWhoa, oh, oh, oh, oh, whoa, oh, oh, oh, it's EVO Scottsdale, EVO Scottsdale\n\nEVO is located in a location where all the restaurants appear......then disappears.  This is not a joke.  I reviewed several restaurants in that location and none is around.  Now comes EVO.  \n\nEVO serves up modern American Italian cuisine. I've heard so much about this place so my foodie friends and I finally convened and went for it.  I did some sharing after a free fireball shot after you check-in with the Yelp App.  Whooo...now my breath smells fresh haha!  My buddy and I ordered the Margarita pizza and added sausage and the EVO salad.  The pizza was okay, kind of tasted like pre-made dough.  The ingredients a top was nothing spectacular.  The EVO salad was my favorite.  Nicely charred kale and brussel sprouts and the pine nuts gave it that extra roast and crunch.  The aroma was nutty and a woody smell.  Overall, one of the best salads I say around!  \n\nService was good and the place itself is really chill and cool.  If anything another round of drinks and the EVO salad is a must. - Enjoy!",2
"Hurray! Another option for lunch on Mill. They have scrumptious pastries, handmade breads, soups, sandwiches, quiches... Went in the other day and had the  Turkey Brie Panini with apples and walnuts and a tropical iced tea.\n\n My meal was great and so was our service. I have to go back to try one of the hand-dipped Bouch\u00e9e chocolates especially knowing they are prepared on site by a chocolatier!",3
"*Solid place, steak frites variety is great (many different ways to get it done) and the oysters were BC (which is awesome as we all know)\n*Spot on service and they make a MEAN martini\n*reasonable prices",3
"This place is essentially a Jimmy Buffett themed TGI Fridays.  And I don't mean that as a compliment.  I split the quesadillas as an appetizer and they weren't good.  There was some sort of pepper relish in them that added a weird flavor.  For the entree I had the tortilla soup which was very average (kind of watery but avocados were fresh, so they get points for that).  I got the sense that they were known for their burgers, so I might recommend sticking with those if you insist on going.  But overall, I thought this place was cheesy and pretty mediocre.",1
"Quality and delicious pizza!! Very good service, very close to my house. I love this place!!! Definitely I will recommend to my friends!!! I love there veggie  lovers pizza",4
My family has been using this dental office for over 10 years now!  The staff really cares about their patients. I love this place. Not a fan of getting dental work done but I surely wouldn't do it anywhere else,4
"Let's get the obvious out of the way:\n\nIt's a chain restaurant.  They have goofy stuff on the walls.  The staff does goofy dances.  They have balloon animals.  And they have a bucket on your table that you can throw scraps into.\n\nNow let's get into the heart of the review: It's pleasant.  They know their shrimp and crab, and their Salmon Orleans is delicious.  Our waitress was funny and went above and beyond in providing good service.  The atmosphere was relaxing and very casual.  They have live music.\n\nSometimes a seemingly ordinary place can just remind you of what's it like to simply have a good time during dinner.  If anything, it reminds me of those little tourist seafood shacks that you visit on vacation with (again) the goofy stuff on the wall, but the food is excellent.  Take that vacation feeling, put it here, and there you go.\n\nI've eaten here before and have never had a bad experience, but this last time, with the food and the attitude just inherently worked for me.  It's also reasonably priced, with a decent selection, so you can easily find something notable to eat here.\n\nIf you want that vacation beach resort attitude without the ocean (trust me, Vegas EXCELS in not providing an ocean experience), you can't do much better than here.",4
I eat here all the time. The place is great. Burrito bomb is Awesome! The owner and staff are great and really get to know you. Great local spot in north PHX!,4
"We ordered a NY thin crust pizza with meatballs, sausage and mushrooms.  It was excellent, with rich savory tomato sauce, the cheese heavy and gooey as we pulled it apart, the meatballs and sausage dripping with flavor.  \n\nOverall, a good thin crust pizza, service was decent, and the place was clean.",3
"I have to put the most important fact up front: This Starbucks has never gotten my order wrong, even when I order some crazy shit that no one else would want.\n\nThat being said, I feel a good/bad breakdown is necessary to really give you the picture on this 'Bucks.\n\nThe good:\n~Super comfy orange chairs by the window that are great to plunk down in and, say, write a Yelp review.\n~The line can get insane looking but I have never had to wait more than a few minutes. \n~Most of the staff are really personable.\n\nThe bad:\n~The parking lot is compartmentalized and really difficult to navigate when full. Also, getting in and out can be a bear & a half.\n~Some of the staff are not so personable which is not exactly what I'm looking for when I haven't had my caffeine yet.\n\nIt's a nice little Starbucks, don't get me wrong. My go-to Starbucks, in fact. But it's not a great Starbucks, and to stand out among a good brand you need to knock it out of the park.",2
"This review is for Brio Tuscan Grille's happy hour, but frankly, considering how poorly happy hour went, I'm never coming back here to try their lunch or dinner. I wanted to try a new happy hour and had heard good things about Brio's food. I took my sister with me to try it out and off we went.\n\nAs soon as the first thing happened, I knew I should have just turned back around and tried another restaurant at Town Square. What happened? There were three employees up at the front of the restaurant chatting with each other and when we entered, I said two for happy hour. The guy said happy hour hour was on the patio and turned back to chatting with his fellow employees. I had never been to Brio before and wasn't sure how to get to the patio. Did he want me to go outside to gain access? Through the restaurant? His arm gesture wasn't too exact. So I asked how to get there, trying to subtly convey \""Could you walk us there?\"" but nope. The guy just kept arm gesturing and said to sit out on the patio.\n\nFine. We walk through the restaurant and exit out a door to the patio. We see an empty table and sit down to wait for a waiter. Five minutes or so later, a harried waiter comes by and asks if we were seated by the front. I said no, we were here for happy hour and the guy up front just told us to sit out on the patio. Apparently the real tables were not meant for people during happy hour and that the couches by the fire pit was designated for happy hour. Uh, that was not mentioned, and this time I flat out asked if the waiter could show us this area. He did and I have to say, the area for happy hour sucked. The tables were made out of some flimsy material (some kind of flexible wood? I don't know) and the chairs/couches were terrible for eating on.\n\nThe waiter said he didn't know which waiter was going to serve us, but he would find out. I thought that was strange, but didn't think much of it. Again, another thing that should have made me just walk out with my sister and try another restaurant at Town Square instead. He came back and said he was our waiter and the entire time, he was just twitchy, like he didn't want to serve us. I guess it's because we were doing happy hour and by default, happy hour customers' bills won't be as high as someone just having dinner? Which is a stupid reason but one I kept leaning towards the longer we stayed at Brio.\n\nI ordered a vodka martini which reads on the menu \""Sobieski Vodka your way: Dirty or Dry with an Olive or Twist.\"" When I ordered it, however, the waiter never gave me an option on how I wanted the martini. When it was served to me, I took a sip and nearly spat it out. It tasted terrible. If it wasn't for the fact that I paid for alcohol, I would have just set it aside, but I finished it because I paid for it and I wasn't going to waste it (but I definitely wasn't happy drinking something I didn't like).\n\nAs for happy hour food, we ordered tomato margherita flatbread, brio burger, and crispy cheese ravioli to share between us. The order took awhile to get to us and when it arrived, the burger was cold and the chips on top of it were stale. It was a dish I thought my sister would enjoy the most because it's a burger, but she refused to eat it after one bite. Instead she ate most of the ravioli. The flatbread was okay, just okay, but it's not something I'd want to pay for.\n\nAfter a disappointing meal and happy hour (sad hour), I asked the waiter as he passed by for the check. I wanted to leave and wash away this disappointment. It took him awhile to hand me my bill and then it took even longer for him to return with my credit card. At that point my disappointment slipped into frustration. Why the heck would a restaurant have a happy hour if they don't want to have a happy hour? Because that's how it felt like. The seating for happy hour was terrible, the staff was terrible, the customer service was certainly terrible, and whether they were short staffed or not, don't act like you don't want me there because I'm going for happy hour and not expensive dinner prices.\n\nBrio Tuscan Grille is one place I will never go to again and, frankly, I will always anti-recommend to people whenever possible. If I could give this place negative stars, I would.",0
"I don't understand why people are giving this awesome place bad reviews. It is DELICIOUS CLEAN and CHEAP! What more do you want for a local little Pho place with great prices and service. We always get good service and the Seafood or Rare Steak Pho is my favorite. The broth is savory and never bland. It's not too salty ( I LOVE SALT) just perfect temperature and the portions are huge. I love their potstickers and egg rolls. I also had their Vermacelli tomato Seafood with no squid and that was pure heaven too. Their sauces on the table are great quality. The open kitchen window is very nice and allows you to see what a small kitchen can put out, which is deliciousness in a bowl. Their boba flavored drinks are all very good, THey have a huge selection of endless iced, coffee, smoothie and teas with or without boba they're all REALLY TASTEY! I live close by and so happy I can go there at least once a week. I love Pho and have had many and this is right up there if not better than some of the Spring Mountain Phos. PLUS they are VERY friendly, they aren't all weird and rude just because I'm not Vietnamese like some places are in Spring Mtn. Don't knock it till you try it and I would say I have a very sofisticated palate and have a good sense for what's good & bad. I'm not picky I'll try anything once. This place is a must!\n\nI promise if you order a simple Pho to start with for those of you who are just starting you won't be dissapointed. LOVE THIS PLACE I'm gonna go now just writing this review made my mouth water!\n\nCash only but you can eat like a King with $20",4
"Ate at El Encanto on 9/25 for lunch with the wife.  We came here because we heard about the great atmosphere and with 3.5 stars it was actually one of the higher rated Mexican places in North Scottsdale (which I still find weird).\n\nOh Yelp how you let me down!!!!  3.5 stars - if you stuck to chips, salsa and bottled beer I could understand that rating but my meal was left 2/3 uneaten (appetizer and entree).\n\nThe setting is unique but is far from special if you are not sitting next to the interior pond.  We were stuck far away from the pond next to a dirty server station and rusty spigot and hose.  When we asked to move \""nothing else was available\"" . . . \n\nFor an appetizer I ordered the Queso Guillermo.  The only thing accurate about the menu description was \""hot bubbling . . .\""  The add-on crispy beef Machomos was truly bad - the two bites I had you had to soften it in your mouth for 30 seconds before you could chew it - like really old beef jerky.  The cheese was stuck to the bottom of the skillet and the oil had separated leaving a wet, greasy mixture of chiles onions and tomatoes.  I hate being so negative but I really lost my appetite after this appetizer.\n\nWhat really sent me over the edge was when the Guacamole arrived - a perfect ice-cream scoop of guacamole that must have been served and stored in a very cold refrigerator long before our order was placed because their were ice crystals in the tomato garnish.\n\nThe only thing positive I can say is that they serve cold beer . . .",0
"The crusty baguette and butter were the high point of the meal. The steak bordelaise was a super-cheap cut of beef smothered in caramelized onions and a cloyingly sweet red wine sauce. Not good at all. The frites were ribbon-cut, which I've never seen before, and were a mixed bag of soggy, limp fries and crisp, tasty ones. This dining experience would have been disappointing if I'd spent $10. The fact that my entree set me back $25 was just painful.\n\nThe only real reason to dine at Mon Ami Gabi is if you snag an outdoor table in order to people watch and take in the Bellagio fountain across the street. Perhaps stick with a cup of onion soup and bread to avoid the inevitable case of the crankies when you feel like you've been culinarily flipped the bird and price gouged.",1
"Excellent food & great service, especially when I want Mexican and my friends want Chinese. We're all happy !",4
Took a friend there for her first time she had The Sheridan and loved it. I had the RB&C which was awesome full of flavor and enough horseradish kick!...good beer selection and great food will always come back to eat here they never disappoint!,3
"This restaurant lives up to its name. They are really true to their concept here. I've dined at the Camelback True Food several times and so when I learned that the new True Food Kitchen was opening at Scottsdale Quarter, I couldn't wait to check it out! A couple visits later and I can rightfully say...Fox, you've done it again! \n\nBelieve it or not, I actually like this True Food better than the original location. The vibe is a lot cooler and more \""natural.\"" I really feel healthier when I walk in. With the garden out back (or is it the front?) and the airiness and open feel, for a brief moment I feel like I'm on the countryside near a stream rather than in the middle of fashionista central. \n\nYes, it's the same exact menu as the other location and maybe because newer always tastes better, but I taste a different for the better in this menu! Everything has a bit more flavor and that's saying a lot because the flavor at the original location is pretty darn good! The hummus here is my favorite starter dish. They add olives and the pita bread is soft and chewy. One of my favorite go-to lunch items here is the Turkey pita sandwich. YUM. It's just as good if not better as I expected. In the past, I haven't been a huge fan of either the hash or the kale salad. The hash has also been kind of blah and the kale salad tasted like I was eating a leaf. But, here...I like both! I don't know what they did, but the hash has much more seasoning and taste. I had the sweet potato hash so that might have something to do with it. And the Kale salad wasn't quite so leafy. \n\nAs for the sides aka drinks and dessert, my favorite drink there is the Medicine Man. It takes a pretty spectacular non-alcoholic drink for me to pay $6, but if there's any drink that lives up to par, it's the Medicine Man. I could probably drink 11 of them, but I hold back. As for dessert, I normally don't opt for dessert at True Food because there's something anti-climatic about it there, but when I do splurge, the Carmel brownie is the way to go. \n\nSo welcome to the corridor True Food! You've made it just a little tastier here!",4
Super sad that there is no bakery or roasted duck inside this Ranch 99 location. :( Everything here is WAY overpriced and nothing is sold in bulk here.,1
"I got into Aria about Midnight and was starving, so as I walked around the amazing complex, I found Lemongrass and was quite impressed. Since it was close to 2 AM, I only ordered a \""Snack\"" of The Tom Kha with Chicken and the Fried Mushrooms. The soup was a serving for two and there were so many mushrooms that they were mounded on the plate! Definitely more than a snack. \nThe Soup had great flavor, lots of chicken and just enough spice to raise a sweat. The mushrooms had a light delicate batter and a deep earthy flavor. The restaurant itself is beautiful and very wheelchair accessible. Service was friendly an efficient. I will be back for dinner next time I visit Aria.",3
"I've tried to like kneaders because everyone talks about it like crazy, but every single time I go I leave unsatisfied and I tell myself I won't come back. The first time I went I found a hair in my sandwich. I understand that things like that happen all the time, but it turned me off. Another time I went I ordered a sandwich and the bread was torn in half making it very difficult to eat. I am just not satisfied with the customer service either. When I have a problem with my meal I feel as though I am a nuisance. I shouldn't feel like that at a restaurant. I will not be going back to kneaders.",0
"I should always yelp places to eat but I was so hungry that I really didn't care where we ate!!  I now regret my decision by picking this place to eat!  Got in line and waited about 5 minutes to get seated.  We sat \""outside\"" so we could see the wonderful scenery of paris, along with the slot machines!  Very paris like ;)  The waiter took our orders and we waited a good 20 minutes to get our food :(\n\nSt. Louis Signature: ($15)- two eggs any style, including a side of thick cut slab bacon and roasted fingerling potatoes.  This pretty much tasted mediocre.  I could make this way better!  This was just your ordinary typical eggs, bacon, and potatoes.  The bacon was the best part but I feel that I could play like $2 and get the same thing at McDonalds!\n\n1/2 Soup/Sandwich combo ($16)- ordered the french onion soup which was delicious and got the chicken salad sandwich.  Mediocre as well.  Felt that Corner Bakery or Panera is way better and cheaper!\n\nI understand it is \""Paris\"" but come on, the food is very bland and it just wasn't that enjoyable.  Probably will not come back.\n\nNOTE:\n-Slow service\n-Bathrooms around the corner",0
"This place is suffering from an identity crisis, but aren't we all these days? Natural wood and terrarium accents clash with bright lights and colors which compete with the multitude of TVs which interrupt the idea that this is a place where you would come to have conversations which questions the whole pro-new-media-we-are-located-in-the-same-building-as-google vibe. But I can kind-of get it; it is Pittsburgh's updated version of socializing (watching and talking about sports in a bright and airy post-industrial space while posting on Facebook and Instagram, or whatever, via smartphone). However, I don't think the atmosphere appeals to anybody in particular, certainly not to me, even though I love terrariums; and I've heard sports fans complain that they keep the volume off (or maybe it was too low) on the TVs (that's just what I heard, could be a rumor! But that's a natural consequence of Social contexts).  I half expected Social to have more techy stuff, like iPads at the table with apps that allow for communication with other tables to play games of sorts or select the music, or something, I wouldn't know. So, I've tried the veggie burger and it was just OK, and I had some pizza at an event once which was also alright. Then, there's a couple of REALLY well crafted things about Social: The Brooklyn Bridge and The Bourbon Blast.",2
"Wow. Husband and I split the Lord Have Mercy!, added brisket, and had sides of mac & cheese, succotash, and cornbread. We wanted to try a little of everything since it was our first time. \nBrisket, pulled pork, both style of ribs, hot links, and chicken were all delicious! Meat was tender, ribs were falling off the bone, and the sauce selection was great. \nThe mac & cheese was incredible. Probably the best I've ever had. Succotash was okay- not very warm. Cornbread and honey butter was great. The bread was not crumbly and the butter wasn't too sweet. \nDefinitely want to go back to try desserts: fried banana split, strawberry shortcake sandwiches, and key lime pie in a mason jar? Count me in!!",3
"Could do a bit better on the friendliness tip.  We weren't asking for much more than a smile or a nice welcome.  The hotel itself is ultra modern when u enter the lobby, and the room is great, large tub is great, but the check-in experience put a bad taste in my mouth.  The Heart Bar is cool though.",1
Decent food at a fairly reasonable pricess (for vegas). Server was friendly and helpful,2
"Although this store may have older games at affordable prices DO NOT have your PS3 repaired there. I took mine in for repair and paid them 70$ up front (which was a mistake). Two weeks later I was called and told that it had been repaired and was ready for pick up. I went there and went home excited to play some new games I had bought. To my dismay, it had the same issues. Freezing and blacking out 2-3 minutes in game.\n\n The very next day I went in to get my money back for their negligence. They wouldn't even give me my refund that day because the owner was not in and would not be in for another week. The man at the counter even wanted a 20$ troubleshooting fee for a product they returned to me as FIXED. I told them no and took my PS3 back.\n\n One week later I called before hand to make sure that I didn't drive all the way over there again to be upset. When I talked to the owner he asked me what they did to repair it. Shouldn't he know since he owns the place? The owner wanted the 20$ for the troubleshooting fee and I refused to accept this. I went over there and got my 70$ refund but at what cost? 3 weeks of this crap and the cost and time to drive there and back only amounted to a lot of frustration. This is a Gamer's Hell.",0
"Food could have been better, but it was nice; all of the employees were super fun and dressed with the theme. I loved the Thai Tea w/ Boba, it was so good. Most places don't put enough milk so the taste is bitter, but they put a lot and I loved it :)",2
"This establishment is poorly managed. The \""manager\"" Thomas gave us burnt mac n cheese and gave us a blank stare wen we comfronted him.  All he could do is give us a cell number to the manager in Arizona.  This was the worst experience ever and I never seen such a poor managed staff.",0
"I normally receive excellent and speedy service at this walgreens. However, the last time that I was in I was treated very rudely and tsk'ed for doing something outside of the store that was none of the employee's business. Yes, he literally said \""tsk tsk.\""  I was so upset that I came home and told my husband who immediately called the store manager to discuss the employee's interaction with me. \n\nI hope that this was an isolated incident because I've never had a single issue in this well maintained store.",1
I like a store where I can get in and get out quickly.  The Men's department all in one handy store.  Was able to stock up on some essentials without any issues.  The staff was friendly and helpful.,2
"Prior to coming here all I heard was \""that place sucks\"" and \""don't go there\"" but it wasn't all that bad. It seems a little small, but it was nice. Waitress was attentive and easy to find, our group got a free bottle of whiskey for having 20+ people, and shots are cheap compared to other locations nearby. I just hated the fact that it was filled with smoke. I'm not a fan of smoke, so that was my only down-side, besides that... I'd come here again.",2
"Pour diner (for dinner):\n\nI dunno, the wait wasn't long and the food was abundant and mostly good.\nThe French onion soup was my biggest disappointment. Luke warm, underseasoned, and no juicy croutons or bubbling cheese.\nBread was of negligible quality too. Surprisingly.\nPork chops with the rhubarb chutney were my favorite! So tender and savory sweet. The proteins here are generally pretty decent.\nGlass of $9 red added a nice punch. Especially with the olives and cheeses they had.\n\nI was examining the crab legs when a guy nearby started asking the lady behind the counter about the availability of clams. He had a French accent. A lady joined him at his side and partook in the conversation about the clams (\""klehms\"").\n\nSo, apparently French fellows eat here. There is surely no higher seal of approval (??). Mixed feelings.\n\nThe buffet interior/\""architecture\"" is absolutely adorable.",2
"Stopped for dinner and it was slow time and service was still slow. The food on the other hand was plentiful and delicious. Had a Ruben with some yummy almost 1/2 pound of meat on it, and the curly fries were yum too. The price was fair too.",2
"This is a strange little place.  They advertise teppanyaki but the teppanyaki room is never open.  They have AYCE sushi.  The sushi is very good and fresh and we have yet to see a crowd.   You can also get everything else on the menu.  The staff is very friendly.  Our only complaint is the lack of variety in the sushi specials.  Although there are three columns of special rolls they are all very similar except for a few with strange sauces.  We have tried nearly everything and only about 1/3 - 1/2 of the items have received repeat performances. There are the usual rules about sharing and leftovers but they don't appear too strict here. We get the AYCE because we can share and try more items for less money. They will make half rolls on request.  We try to go here about once a month since our 7 year old loves her some sushi.  Our search for the perfect sushi place continues but until we find it, Nagoya will keep us fat and happy.",2
"I should've known better than to come here, but I was out running errands, was starving and saw this place as I drove out of the nearby CVS. The restaurant looks like an older run down place serving up Americanized Chinese food. The whole time I was sitting inside and reading the menu I felt unsure if I really wanted to eat here but I told myself I should at least try it since I was there. I ordered a beef chow fun to go since it's kind of hard to mess that dish up so I figured I was safe.\n \nWhen my order was ready it was handed to be in a bag where I noticed they didn't provide utensils or chopsticks but I was too lazy to go back in since I was already in the car. Strike 1. When I opened the box I noticed that the portions were way smaller than most other Chinese places while they are charging a full entree price ($8.50-10.00)  for everything including the beef chow fun. Strike 2. The beef was fully cooked but had a weird taste to it and the dish overall just seemed bland. Strike 3. \n\nI would not recommend this place at all and even Panda Express would be a better choice since their food has more flavor. This place also has a $20 card minimum so bring cash if you're not going to be spending over 20 bucks, which I'm sure is not hard to do here.",1
"Friendly staff. Not sure why I continue to use the drive through. If there is a long line, it's quicker to pull into a stall and order.",3
"Let me begin by stating that the food here was amazing.  I ordered a beef burrito, which was packed with flavor.  It had some sort of tomato based sauce which was just amazing.  \n\nMy wife had some sort of carne asada tacos and we both shared a magarita.\n\nThe salsa was fresh tasting, tangy and light - just wonderful.\n\nI'm not a drinker, but that margarita was delicious as well!\n\nI *really* wanted to give them five stars, because their food was delicious, but two things kept me from doing that:\n\n1) The first little bowl of salsa is free, but the second they charge you $.95 for.  I have never had to pay for additional salsa and believe that it's a horrible idea to charge for any sort of condiment....ever.  Chips and salsa are a staple of Mexican restaurants - don't be greedy and try to make more money off the back end.  I happen to like salsa on my burrito and my wife put salsa on her tacos as well.  Horrible, horrible idea to charge for additional salsa.  I understand it's fresh, it's great and all that, but suck up the cost - an $11 burrito has enough of a profit margin to give the condiments for free.  \n\nI speak from the perspective of both a foodie and a commercial food photographer - I eat at and work in a LOT of restaurants and can say with complete authority that it's sort of thing makes people walk out and never return.  Charging for salsa would not fly in Vegas.\n\n2) We were served quickly, however one table next to us waited so long for service that they walked out.  Another table next to us had a messed up order (the waitress forgot to put in an order for guacamole).  While this did not happen to us personally, it's an indication that there could be a service problem.\n\n3) The manager glared at us angrily when we walked in.  Don't stare at your customers, but if you do, freaking smile.\n\nNormally the downsides would have me leaving a 3 start review, but the food truly was incredible.  We live in Las Vegas and we often complain that we can never find GREAT Mexican food.  I don't care about authenticity, I just want excellent taste and this place really delivered on taste and we are sure to be talking about Diego's until the next time we find ourselves in Wisconsin!",3
"Pane Bianco has changed in recent years - and they have only made the place more wonderful. I appreciate the expansion, as it makes the place a wonderful spot to meet friends for lunch without feeling cramped or overheated (by sitting outside). The french press coffee is to die for, and I can't wait to come back and try dinner! I had the soppressata which was just as delicious as I remembered from 8 years ago. And yes, I am a vegetarian!\n\nI also purchased some Hayden Flour Mill pizza flour that I cannot wait to try! It's incredible to me that they mill all that flour out back! Talk about eating local - it's locally grown wheat, milled right there in the back, packaged under their roof and sold to you. It's like a dream. So go - grab some to-go, meet friends, take your kids, and eat. good. food.",4
"I've been coming to this place since college, and I can tell you its definitely one of those \""an oldie but a goodie\"".  So, its not a fancy schmancy place with hip party music playing and it doesn't serve mixed drinks with cute names like \""hello kitty\"", but it should be a staple to anyone's lunch place repertoire.  \n\nThey serve bento boxes (basically a lunch box with rice, your choice of entree, salad and slices of oranges--a healthy dessert!) for $3.75.  If you're feeling like a high roller, you can order the sashimi bento box, and that will set you back a whopping $6.\n\nWho says you can't eat good for cheap?",3
"pretty yummy! a sandwich and fries type place with little things that throw you off here and there to show that they have variety. \n\nThe pricing is decent, an average of about $10. You can choose to order as all you can eat or al a carte, up to you. Since I don't have a big appetite to begin with I opted for al a carte. really, the food is nothing fancy but it's good. We had the Mac Daddy (mac and cheese sliders), Wagynu sliders (beef burger with onions), and the Mediterranean platter. Everything was really good, more worth it if you do all you can eat bc there are only two sliders and let me tell you for their size $10 is not worth it!! LOL. \n\nOur server was Michael. Really nice guy and we actually ordered everything he recommended. The restaurant itself is tucked away from all the stoag stench and really cozy.",2
YUM!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!\n\nWe definitely needed some Asian comfort food.  Just the thought of their delicious noodle makes my mouth water.\n\n\nWe came as a group of 7.  We had the shu mai and har gow.  They were decent.\n\nI ordered the beef stew noodles (one of my fav comfort foods) and it was really delicious and SPICY!  \n\nMy friends ordered the won ton soup.  Delicious!  The fried spare rib noodles were really good too.\n\n\nThere were soooo many items on the menu that I wanted to try.  The chicken broth... the fish congee.... even the almond tofu dessert. \n\nI will definitely stop here on my next trip to Vegas!!! Highly recommended.\n\nIt's a little pricey but still affordable.,3
"I was teetering between 2 and 3 stars until I looked at the Yelp definition that reads \""Meh. I've experienced better.\"" I had the cheeseburger and wasn't too impressed. I also had the pretzel appetizer which was okay. Even though the service was good, I don't see my self running back to this place. $30 dollars before tip for two cheeseburgers, two sodas and a pretzel appetizer. The server just gave me the credit card receipt without the detail of items ordered and charged. The only saving grace was that this meal was charged to the company credit card.",1
"This is my favorite Thai restaurant in the states...and a nice escape from the Strip.  Last night I ordered the crispy duck with panang...level 10 spice.  If you're like me, you love the heat.  A word to the wise...most Thai places somehow think Americans can't handle it so even a level 10 isn't a level 10.  Lotus of Siam is an exception.  Be very cautious with level 10...even if you order curry.  My stomach is still on fire...they are very liberal with REAL Thai chilis that are fresh and smokin' hot.  This place has a good mix of tourists and locals so you know it's good.  On your next trip to Vegas, make sure you give it a try.",4
"If I could give this place NEGATIVE stars I would. I live in the area and dropped by to check it out. The male nail tech looking like a wanna be justin beiber with his hair combed front, has the worst customer service. I went in along with a friend who was getting a full set. Anyways, he asked if I wanted a full set, I said no I wanted to get a pedicure. He decides that because I didnt want a fullset, I wasnt going to get a pedicure. Long story short, he helps the next customers waiting while im waiting for a pedicure chair. So we get into a light argument because I tell him, I was waiting. Needless to say I refused to get any service done at this place and he went crazy saying I was causing him stress. A few other customers waiting ended up walking out too. Aaaaand im sitting here writing this review yes in their waiting area im being told this guy is the owner...I hope you know as an owner you lost a grip of customers today",0
"A perfectly serviceable steakhouse; nothing to recommend it over other steakhouses (both food- and ambiance-wise)... but if you're in the area and want steak, this will do! Reasonably reasonable prices ($35 for petite filet, $20 for chicken) and bland-swanky decor...sort of like a Marie Callender's of steakhouses, for boring married couples or retirees on budgets who never go out to a steakhouse. If you rarely go out, you'll dig it...otherwise, it's pretty solidly Meh. In fact, I would have given it two stars...except it gets an extra star for its blessed un-pretentiousness (no stupid all-caps name, no deconstructed or fusion dishes, and no douchebaggy club music playing).",2
"Let's admit it: this place is neither Chinese nor Mexican.  Not that I have a problem with that.  I just see it as another Panda Express or Baja Fresh - good ole American fast food.  I have been here twice and the food has been good both times.  I have now tried: jade red chicken, emerald chicken, machaca, carnitas, cuban black beans, refried beans, and pork fried rice.  My favorites are the jade red chicken and pork fried rice.  On my second visit, the food was a little salty, but again, this is American fast food.  The snickerdoodle cookie is also a nice touch.  I need to be sure to make it one day for their volcano cookie.  Portions are big enough to have leftovers for another meal.  This is granted that I always pick quesadilla for one of my combo choices.  Service has been good on both visits even though all the workers seem a little young.  They were friendly, helped with the menu, and gave samples for first timers.  I have to admit, $10 for a combo + drink is high for a fast food joint, but somehow, I know I will be going back.  Oh yeah, for $10, they can do better than plastic lawn chairs and tables.",2
Just got back from vegas this weekend and was sadly dissappointed with this place..we got bumped from the original room we reserved and then we got placed in some room down the way from some loud ass people and their loud ass kids. I felt like i was staying at a motel 6. I would'nt stay here again :(,1
"This is a place I can't imagine will still be here. First, horrible location. Second it is a large seating area which is almost always nearly empty everytime I pass by or go in.  Third, even though there was only 2 other customers in the place, not a single person approached us as we stood at the front desk waiting to be seated.  15 minutes we stood there waiting for someone to even notice us.  When we finally did sit down, we were again ignored for long periods of time.  Finally left because no one took our order.  \n\nIn my humble opinion, you can't succeed with a Mexican Bar and Grill that has high prices for the same food you can get at the corner taco shop, especially in such a location with little foot traffic, poor visibility and bad customer service.",1
"They are about to switch over to the new name of The D so I have no idea what to expect. That being said Fitzgerald's was never known as the Bellagio of Freemont Street. I do think that you should come to Las Vegas and if this is the only place available come anyway! Live it up, you are in Las Vegas for cryin' out loud!",1
"Let me explain myself before I start bashing. I do like this gym I liked the general manager eddie and most of the customer service has been fantastic. The price is great and its very conveniently located (for me)...\n\nSo I am writing a more personal and lowly review because of experiences the people closest to me have had with this particular location. I have also spoken other people who work at LA FITNESS and I don't believe I am completely alone in my opinion. \nI don't mean for this to sound as harsh as it will, and I am sorry if I offend anyone but I am NOT taking this down. \n             Everything at LA FITNESS is great. Right?  Now from what I have seen most of the personal trainers are fantastic, they're great people who are really just trying to help you out. I mean that's their job right? \n                So this review is specifically because of a few \""Personal Training Managers\"" Who I find are offensive, lazy, egotistical and a little bit snobbish.(Yes I know I'm probably personally attacking a few people, but I am pretty pissed about this, so if you are reading this it is biased and I'm not denying it)  When I first signed up I was told that I would receive one free training with Jason, who is this like macho trainer who everyone wants to be with, and when you see him he's pretty good looking so I don't blame anyone. He calls a few days after I joined and he seemed like an okay guy, we set up a meeting a week later and that was that. \n             So I get a call a few hours before my scheduled meeting with Jason to reschedule because of a conflicting something or other. So fine we can't come to a day where we're both available and I don't book for personal training. I work better alone. I'm not kidding when I say this, the next time I spoke to him he was rude and seemed rather aggravated, like me trying to book for an appointment was too big of a deal.  He might have been having a bad day, I can forgive him for that. \n            So this is the part that hurts me personally, my mother recently joined, and she had prepaid for 33 sessions (which they messed up too, but she can deal with that and it's not supposed to be part of my review) She booked specifically for Jason, and instead of calling her put her with another trainer. Jason on the other hand is sitting at his desk on his phone with an LA FITNESS employee laughing and talking it up. Maybe it was important, maybe it wasn't but watching it happen sort of irritated me. My mother came up to me after her session and started telling me that her \""new\"" trainer was telling her that her 33 prepaid sessions were expired, and Jason was off the phone soon. So my mother goes up to Jason and is asking if she could have a chance to discuss what is happening with her sessions.  He says \""No this conversation is over, You've irritated me since I met you, I'm done with you\""................\n\n\n\n a personal trainer overheard the way this man spoke to my mom and she was appalled she gave us the names of other personal trainers and my mom has happily been visiting Robert for her personal training needs. \n\nI have met other people while at LA FITNESS who have had conflicts with Jason as well, so I do not feel so terrible about bashing him. \n\nI  am appalled, I am so livid I have not been back since, I am filing a grievance as will my mom and I don't have anything else to say",0
"I can honestly say this place is a hidden gem! A friend and I were searching Yelp for some good Mexican food around the south Eastern area when we stumbled across this place, checked some reviews, peeped at some food pics and took the plunge! The chips to begin the meal at almost all restaurants can't hold a candle to these chips, they tasted so fresh like they had just fried up some corn tortilla's and delivered them to our table with some very good salsa. We ordered the fries with shredded beef and cheese as an appetizer. They were so good, fries were cooked perfect and had bunches of cheese and beef. My friend likes onions and I don't, so they actually made pico with no onions separately for me, that was way cool. We both ordered the three Carne Asada tacos combo, they come with pico, cilantro and limes, once again they hooked me up with onion less pico!! These taco's are a little slice of heaven, small but so full of flavor. Service was excellent, and staff was very friendly.",4
"Sorry this review won't be too useful because I went there a few years back, but I have to put this one review in, just because how good this place is.  We ordered all steak, including two orders of the Kobe Beef (so they called it).  I don't know what they did to the Kobe beef, or maybe IT IS the REAL KOBE beef, because they really had that melt in your mouth beef texture, VERY GOOD! YUM!  StripSteak also have great fries, everyone on my table liked but I don't really remember how it taste like, it's just special, one of the specialty you have to have at this restaurant.  This place is definitely more expensive than most of the steak restaurants in LV, they even tell you it's about $110 per person averagely, but if you are looking to eat at a nice steak restaurant with great steak in Las Vegas regardless of the price, this place is the place to go!  Oh one more thing, don't get the Kobe beef hot pot thingy, it's not worth it, it's good, but not worth it.",4
Went for lunch and had breakfast. Some of the best Chicken fried steak I've ever had!!! Can't wait to try the lunch items such as the chili burger. Great service!! If your in the area or looking for great diner food head here....reminded me of many great diners back in Connecticut I've been to .,3
"I have never seen one of the Dr's. here, but I have always gotten excellent care from their awesome PA's. I will certainly be back as it was easy to get in and get an appointment.",2
"Always love going into this store!!! Its so much fun, the associates are very helpful.  Its nice because you can custom make a completely blingout shirt for a very reasonable price.  The quality of their workmanship definetly shows!\n\nIts also nice that you don't have a minimum order requirement or setup fee.  The owner works hard to keep her costs for items affordable for every need.\n\nI LUV them! :)",4
"What happened to this place? This was our college hang out. I stopped in for a happy hour with my college buddies... NOT the same. The happy hour buffet SUCKED! We ended up ordering appetizers. They tasted ok... Not much of a drink special. Oh, we were very disappointed... I guess the next college get together will be somewhere else...",1
Shouldve stayed as subway. Hovel of a place but it had more soul than what it's become.,0
"Never used their service, and never will.  Yesterday I was driving along side one of their cars in Glendale, and one of their drivers-a 400 lb. behemoth of a man rolls down his window and litters a bunch of paper all over the street.  I tried to call the company, but evidently their is no supervisor EVER available, and no way to even leave a message.  Rude operators too-I'm done here.",0
"My recommendation: water\n\nWe ordered buffalo wings and loaded potato skins as a \""hold me over\"" food because nothing else in PHX airport looked open, but I'm not quite sure what we got.  The buffalo wings were chicken tenders coated with a really thin layer of really acrid/burn your mouth off buffalo sauce, and the potato skins were loaded with...oil.\n\nDo yourself a favor and buy something from a vending machine if you're hungry.  Totally not worth the $30 that we spent here for two dishes + tax/tip...not even CLOSE.",0
I went with my sister to get a pedicure while she was visiting here from Germany and it was her first experience. I myself just moved to Las Vegas and was looking for a good and reasonably priced nail salon. We made the appointment spontaneously and got one right away for the next day. \nWe both loved it! They did a great job and we were able to sit together. It was also very relaxing and the result was amazing. So we actually decided to also get a manicure and even though they were very busy they actually managed to fit us in spontaneously for a manicure. We were so happy and loved the results on both feet and hands for a great price!!!!\nI definitely plan on coming back!,4
"Sammy G!!!! Best service eveeeeeeerrrrrrrr!  Great atmosphere, better food, and the friendliest people. Also, the cocktail list never fails and nor do the daily vegetables.  See you all again soon :-)",4
"As I was singing along to Shy Boy by Secret, I kind of found myself in a bit of a surprised state, am I eating at a Korean Restaurant or a Sushi joint? There really isn't much to say about this place, but I'll state the Pros and Cons of my first experience here at Sushi Kaya. \n\nPros:\n-AYCE for $19.99. So decently priced\n-We were seated immediately upon entering and our orders were taken.\n-The place is clean, roomy and open late. I believe till 3a. \n-Karaoke available here!\n-The rice used on the sushi is really A+, not too sticky or vinegary. \n-Minimal use of yum yum/teriyaki sauces (a con if you like the sauces) \n-A lot of avocado used in the rolls (Loooove Avocado) \n-Soju is served here!!!!\n-Appetizers here are Japanese and Korean combination. Few of my favorites being the Kim Chi fried rice, Dukkbokki (good flavor, but the rice cakes seems quickly pan fried so it had sort of a crunch on the outside) and the no rice roll, which was a ball of spicy tuna with shrimp tempura in the middle and topped with avocado. \n-the only ROLL that was Great is the Kaya Roll. \n\nCons:\n-Nigiri sushi selections were pretty good. It's hit or miss with the quality of the fish. Some orders were really good, and some other (same) orders later seemed kinda off. \n-They were taking your orders frequently, but it seemed more often than the food ever came out. We would wait for our food, but instead of steady plates coming out, they'd bring it out all at once. \n-for the Rolls, there was a lot of cream cheese and avocado selections. it seemed like almost all the rolls had either cream cheese or avocado or both. there wasn't much variety for the rolls. \n-for the skewers, you were only allowed one each person or something like that, so we were only allowed to have one type of skewer each. :(( The beef tongue skewer was sort of flavorless anyways. \n-Parking is really hard to find. A small parking area.\n\nAll in all, it wasn't totally bad, but it wasn't impressive either. I'd come back here again, but it wouldn't be my first, second or third choice. I'm still on a sushi hunt!!! \n\nSayonara or Annyeong Haseyo!",2
"I'm an out-of-towner who has been going to Rome's for lunch since 2005.  Everytime I have went there, I've been delighted.\n\nMost of the time, I get 3 slices of pizza.  It's real great New York-style pizza -- nice thin crust, good cheese and sauce, and just the right amount of grease.  \n\nI have found their stuffed shells w/meatballs to be outstanding.  They have great meatballs.  Chicken parmigiana and cheesesteaks were also good.\n\nService is great.  I have gotten to know the nice Italian lady who runs the counter over the years.  Very nice lady.",4
"Holy smokes...in all my years I have never had a restaurant fall so far so fast...I have eaten here for lunch a few times and had 4 to 5 star experiences...yes the dinner experience was that bad. \n\nWe came in tonight celebrating a family event, I made reservations for 4 people for 5:15 (cold and rainy day in Charlotte).\n\nBefore I start the review....for the love of all that is Holy..PUT SOME SLIDERS underneath your chairs...everytime someone moved their chair it sounded like nails across a chalkboard.\n\nService:\nAt 5:05 we walked in..bar was open, one other table was seated, but hostess said they needed 10 minutes to get ready before we could sit as restaurant was not open.  My wife noted hey, it's freezing out there and instead of suggesting even waters at our table the hostess shrugged...we went to a different restaurant for a cocktail.\n\nWhen we came back 15 minutes later, 4 tables were already seated.   We ordered a cocktail, and of course it was 15 minutes before we got it.\n\nWe were then given 3 menus, when we had 4 people .  We asked for a fourth menu and were asked why...your kids can share.  Really?\n\nEven my kids were mad, their waters were never refilled, the waitress seriously grabbed the appetizer plates from underneath them mid bite.   \n\n\n\nFood:\nWe had the Veg and non-Veg app, non veg was nice but overpriced....all the Veg was deep fried with little differentiation in flavor....\n\nMy wife ordered currry, and it looked like an oil slick...my lamb ven de alho was very good, except the rice they brought stuck together and looked like it was day old leftovers.  Both dishes were $17...again overpriced...and na'an was $6 even with 2 entrees.\n\n\n\nI hardly ever give 5 stars, nor do I ever give 1 star...but what an incredible discrepancy.  Maybe I will try it again for lunch....but I will never come back for dinner.  My wife thought I was crazy for even recommending, and she is very easy to please.\n\nI cannot remember a time when I just wanted dinner to be done with so I could get the heck out of a restaurant....\n\nNet...food quality suffered tremendously, service was rushed and awful, food came out slow, ambience was incredibly bad....and $108 I will never get back.\n\nDid I mention...PLEASE PUT SLIDERS ON THE CHAIRS...three Advils later and I'm still haunted by the noise!",0
"This place is not really that great. I checked in yesterday and the door to the room was not really working because you have to literally push it hard to get it to open. I spent 5-10 minutes trying to figure out what was wrong with the door before slamming into it. If that wasn't bad enough, when I finally got into the room, it turns out that one of the lamps was not working, the t.v. did not have a signal input, and the internet was wired with no wireless options. I can't believe this hotel seriously does not offer any wi-fi options despite the fact that it charges a resort fee like the other hotels. The Medieval theme is realistic I guess since the atmosphere is dark, grungy, kinda stuffy, and you get the idea. The buffet isn't that great either. I would recommend just saving your money and trying out the new food court (much cheaper and better tasting food). If you haven't tried the buffet yet, go ahead and give it a shot, but don't say I didn't warn you!\n\nP.S. This is my first time rating a place with 2 stars. That should tell you how I feel about this place lol.",1

"Beef Ramen was Campell's broth with spaghetti noodles. \n\nBanh Mi served on a hoagie bun?\n\nPho served with udon instead of the traditional rice noodles?\n\nWTF!? \n\nI live a few blocks away and used to go to Miss Saigon all the time.  Now, every couple weeks I'll convince myself it's worth going to Kanda House just because it's convenient and I regret it every time.  I swear this is the last time!  It's also more expensive than Miss Saigon used to be too.  Judging from how empty it is every time I've gone, I can only hope that it will go out of business soon and Miss Saigon will return.",0
"Ich war gestern mit meiner Partnerin zum essen dort. Fr\u00fcher in meiner Kindheit war die Pizzeria Centrale der Italiener schlecht hin. Leider ist auch schon einige Zeit vergangen  die Pizzeria hat mich total entt\u00e4uscht. Die Bedienung war nett, freundlich und schnell. Sie hat uns auf nachfrage einen super Wein empfohlen. Die Atmosph\u00e4re war eigentlich ganz ok, wenn der Tisch nicht durch (vermutlich) altes Fett total geklebt h\u00e4tte und die Rentnergruppe 5 Tische weiter nicht den ganzen Raum mit unterhalten h\u00e4tte. Generell hat es mir ein wenig an Sauberkeit gefehlt, wenn man den Arm auf den Tisch legt und der an dem Tisch fest klebt ist es schon ekelig. Zu essen hatten wir zwei Salate, eine Lasagne und eine Pizza. Die Lasagne war total verw\u00e4ssert und kaum gew\u00fcrzt, kam uns ein bisschen vor als h\u00e4tte sich die Pizzeria an die Rentner (von denen sehr viele da waren) angepasst, denn alle Speisen waren kaum gew\u00fcrzt. Die Pizza war eine Vegetaria mit frischem Gem\u00fcse der Saison. Leider hat der Pizzab\u00e4cker die goldenen Regeln des Pizzabackens nicht gekannt. Denn jeder wei\u00df, bei mehr als 3-4 Zutaten wird die Pizza matschig. Bingo! In der Mitte der Pizza lag eine komplette Paprikah\u00e4lfte, die erst nach langem begutachten als solche erkannt wurde. Dann waren rings rum Zuchinischeiben (eigentlich nicht schlecht, da diese aber viel zu dick waren, waren sie nicht gar), Spargel, Artischocken, Zwiebeln, Spinat, Champignons und gegrillte Avokado drauf. Dadurch war die Pizza zwar am Rand knusprig, aber sonst total matschig. Als K\u00e4se wurde bedauerlicher wei\u00dfe kein Mozarella (wie er auf eine richtige Pizza geh\u00f6rt) verwendet sondern Edammer. Von dem K\u00e4se war auch viel zu viel drauf, die Schickt war fast 1cm dick. Die Tomatenso\u00dfe habe ich gesucht, man hat sie zwar am \u00e4u\u00dferen Rand etwas gesehen aber kaum geschmeckt. Leider war fast gar keine So\u00dfe drauf! (Wieder mal nichts gew\u00fcrzt) Die Salate waren echt lecker, das Dressing war gut, leider h\u00e4tte es auch hier mehr W\u00fcrze sein k\u00f6nnen. Pfeffer und Salz auf dem Tisch haben das Dressing bzw. den Salat richtig lecker gemacht, dazu wurde total weiches Wei\u00dfbrot serviert (Ich denke wieder an die Rentner..) Essig und \u00d6l haben wir leider nicht bekommen. Positiv anmerken muss ich, das wir die Pizza (eigentlich 9EUR) nicht bezahlen mussten, da ich beim abr\u00e4umen auf nachfrage der Kellnerin ehrlich geantwortet habe das die Pizza durch und durch einfach nur mies war. Trotzdem haben wir gute 30EUR bezahlt. Wenn ich \u00fcberlege das es eigentlich fast 40EUR gewesen w\u00e4ren, f\u00fcr die Qualit\u00e4t ist das echt heftig. Leider kann ich keinem empfehlen dort hin zu gehen, ich habe in letzter Zeit oft geh\u00f6rt das die Pizzeria Centrale nachgelassen hat, aber ich war doch schockiert was passiert ist. Den 1 Stern gibt es f\u00fcr die freundlichkeit und nettigkeit der Bedienung, sowie der Kulanz. Das Essen an sich h\u00e4tte eigentlich keinen Stern verdient, es war echt nichts  leider. Ich werde trauriger wei\u00dfe wohl nie wieder kommen :(",0
"I ordered a Chicken Focaccia and got a Chicken Wrap with a side of attitude.\n\nGlad to see another sports bar by work so my coworkers and I headed there for lunch. The place was busy, as it was the lunch hour and it looked like the TV section at Best Buy. \n\nI asked our server if she wouldn't mind having our orders on separate checks. \n\nHer response:\n\""I'm not obligated to do it so if I have time, I'll do it.\""\n\nWhat I wanted to say to her:\n\""Bitch, please!\""\n\nI ordered a Chicken Focaccia and when I got my order, it was a wrap. Since all my coworkers started eating and she was no where in sight, I just ate it. When she came around, I asked her if this was supposed to be a sandwich:\n\nHer response:\nWell, this is our version of focaccia. The wrap is like a thin pita bread quesadilla thing. Its not focaccia. Its our version. I thought you knew because you come here all the time. Well... do you like it?\n\nFirstly, this was my first time but I must look like I eat here all the time.\n\nWhat I wanted to say to her:\n\""Bitch, please!\""\n\nThe wrap was basically chicken chunks, mayonnaise and a pita bread quesadilla thing. Whatever that means. It was gross. \n\nIf I wasn't there with a bunch of other people, I probably would have sent it back but we were all on our lunch break together. For my first visit, you get one star for poor service and not knowing what focaccia is.",0
"I've had these cupcakes from three locations, including the huge cupcake bake-off competition. They're always bland, a bit flavorless, and artificial-tasting. I don't hate them, but the frosting is too thick and heavy and the cake is dense and blah.\n\nFurthermore, they're not always served fresh. The cupcakes they served at the cupcake bake-off were still partially frozen.",1
"Is this place gourmet? No\nIs it exactly what you want in a sports bar? Yes. \n\nHUGE menu, decent food, great prices, mediocre wait staff and a fantastic array of flat screens that play all the big games and ALL the pay per views!\n\nThe best place for pre-gaming outside of downtown!",3
"Given the great reviews I had high expectations for Mr. Mama's.  They were not met.  It is clean and the staff is friendly but there is nothing exceptional about the breakfast other than the long wait to be seated.  The hash browns, omelette, and French toast were average and no where near as good as other reviewers described them.  I was surprised that they did not put out real butter.  If you want it be sure to ask.  \n\nThe prices are reasonable and the food is not bad but I think that Mr. Mama's is living off the momentum of earlier popularity.",1
"I got food poisoning from eating raw chicken. It was dark in the bar and I thought it looked a little pink but figured it was the lighting. I got extremely ill that night and all the next day. When I cut open my leftover chicken it was completely raw and pink in the middle. That was definitely the worst part of my dining experience, but it wasn't the only part. Went with a group of 4 on a Sunday afternoon. We ordered 2 burgers, a turkey burger, and I ordered off the healthy menu the chicken breasts with brown rice. \nThe 3 burgers came out without my chicken. One burger was fine, one we had asked for no cheese but it was on it, and another came without the barbecue sauce and with a package of apple slices (which was almost a month expired) instead of baked chips. We brought this to our waitresses attention, she apologized and felt the need to bring out the ticket to show us she put it in right, that it was the kitchens fault (probably because she didn't want her tip to be affected). The burger with the cheese on it came back, with nothing on it! They took off all the condiments and the bacon. Still no barbecue sauce, baked chips, or my chicken. We sent it back, and it was brought back again however we noticed that they had just scraped the cheese off the original burger and gave it back. \nAt this point the burger had been messed up 3 times and we still didn't have barbecue sauce, baked chips, or my chicken. We went to get the manager to explain what was going on, and the two burger were re done correctly, however I still had no chicken. After complaining again the promptly brought it out, raw! I guess that is what you get for complaining about how long food was taking, but it had been an hour which should have been plenty of time to cook chicken. \nThe food actually tasted decent which is why it is disappointing we will never go back. It isn't worth the risk of food poisoning and the spotty and inconsistent service. Though it was not our servers fault that the kitchen kept screwing up, she did start avoiding us when things went south to the point where we didn't have beverages either. I have tried calling management twice, with no one available.",0
"We went in for what we thought was going to be some good Italian, wrong! I had Speight and Meatballs, It was like being in High School, HORRIBLE! My date had Pork Chop Milanese, dry overcooked and not sure what the spice was but good god BAD!!! The Manager was watching TV doing nothing, going outside? Another bad Italian restaurant! I thought with a name like Mancuso behind it, well you get the picture. I hate to say it but Olive Garden was better, now that's scary!",0
"I went there today with a friend and it was overall terrible. Our server had no clue what was on the menu or any recomendations. I had some sushi and the tuna was warm and tasted old. Not to mention the sushi took over twenty five minutes to get. I had a bloody mary and our server said she had no idea how to make one. I think she left out the vodka. I had a shrimp stir fry and it was cold when it came out. The server said it came with noodles, turned out it didnt so i asked for some and was charged for something she said was in it to begin with. Overall it sucked and hope they hire a new server and a quick lunch wouldnt be over an hour long.",0
"Just wanted to give two thumbs up to McCarran for offering free wifi!  I hope other airports will soon follow suit.\n\nBesides that, it's a nice, well-laid out airport.  No complaints from me.",3
"First the Mekong food court has a charm all its own.  Enjoy it, embrace it.  We knew from prior reviews that Wholly Grill's claim to fame was the pork belly.  We tried the pork belly, tilapia and shrimp skewers all of which were very good as were portions and value.  The plates were topped off with plenty of rice and a side dish, which for both of us were steamed veg.  Pork belly would elsewhere be more expensive, and the tilapia was expertly foil wrapped and grilled with a fragrant and tasty ginger/onion/tomato mix.  All in all, much better than you'd expect from a food court meal.",3
"I love this airport... whether your arriving or departing, you move quickly.  I love how well organized parking and taxi/shuttle service is.... the taxi lines move quick.  Tons of shops, food, and slots to pass the time. Free wi-fi is a PLUS!",2
McCarran Airport and I share a strong love/hate relationship.\n\n- I love to travel; McCarran is an international airport (important)\n- I love seeing family and friends visit (and picking them up)\n- I hate the useless signs that go to all different directions \n- I hate waiting on my plane \n- I hate leaving Las Vegas,3
"Yum!  The ambiance in this place is a bit weird - it feels like a 1960's Thai diner - but the food and service are both fantastic.  I tried out the Thai Hut fried rice and my husband had the Drunken Noodles.  Both were delish.  I  can't wait to eat the leftovers.  It's nice to have another place within walking distance, too.  \n\nOne thing to note - their 'medium' level was more like mild-medium.  Not very spicy, at least on the fried rice.",3
"For a lunch spot, Uncle Maddio's hits the spot.  It is a great place for fast and decent pizza that is made in front of you as you walk down a line selecting your ingredients (think Subway subs ordering process).\n\nAtmosphere - Loud, busy, small...fast casual.\n\nService - I have been here twice and the service has always been fast and friendly, despite the Uptown lunch rush.  Yes, on one visit I did notice the employees get someone's order wrong and it took some effort to get it resolved...but hey...it wasn't mine...ha!\n\nFood - There are a lot of options here at Maddio's when ordering your custom made personal pizza pie.  \n\nDough: First, you've got to select your dough.  I have had both the original dough (see pic) and the wheat dough (never tried the Gluten Free).  Based on my experience...get the wheat dough.  The original dough was too chewy and tough (i.e. leathery).  It reminded me of how I feel the crust at Fuel Pizza gets after about 20 minutes out of the oven.  However, the wheat dough at Uncle Maddio's is soft and easy to eat.\n\nSauce: Both times I chose the Tomato-Basil, which has a nice and noticeable flavor.  I did not need to add anything to make this sauce standout.   \n\nCheese: Yes, there a few options here too.  But it's pizza...you've got to get the Mozzarella...so I did.\n\nToppings:  You get to choose three.  The two times I was here I got the same three toppings (pepperoni, mushrooms, and banana peppers).  I am happy to the report that the mushrooms at Maddio's are sliced fresh and NOT the watery canned variety...which IMHO are awful.\n\nPrice - Personal pizza w/ a drink is about right at $10.  Not too bad for the size of the pie you receive here.\n\nOverall - I have Uncle Maddio's in my lunch rotation...I think you should too.",3
"I love Trader Joe's! Especially, buying 1 liter of extra virgin olive oil for $5.99!

"So what do you do  when it's time to check out of your room at the Encore, and you try to add an extra day and it's $400/night?  You check the internet and stay at Treasure Island for $100!\n\nI know, when you go from Encore to TI, you may be setting yourself up for disappointment, but I was pleasantly surprised.  Like Kimmy T said, the rooms are updated to be \""sleek and modern\"" and while they were considerably smaller than those at the Wynn and Encore, I didn't feel cramped.  The beds are comfy and there's a nice spacious feeling to an otherwise small room.  The bathrooms, however, were on the smaller side and the TV? Well, let's just say you're better off doing something else.  \n\nThe casino is a bit on the darker side for me and has this weird air freshener smell.  It was really strong.  It's a little like they were trying a bit too hard to cover up the casino, smoke infested smell.  They do have a nice amount of casual eating options, since in general, they are more open to visitors with families. \n\nOther than that, for the price, it really is still a good bet.  The internet specials are the way to go, since they offer better deals than the front desk.  Speaking of the front desk, I had to have my room key reactivated, and the line was longer than the one for Space Mountain at Disneyland.  Only at DLand, they at least move fairly quickly.  They had minimal staff helping and those that did, weren't friendly and obviously were hating being there.  If it weren't for the front desk, they may have made it to 3 1/2 stars, but not today.",2
"I ordered a piece of pie and a coffee in the coffee shop at 2am when the place was empty. In half an hour no one even walked past my table enough for me to ask them where my order was. I had to walk up to the front desk and threaten to walk out.\nThe roller coaster runs around the hotel. Think carefully. This means your hotel room shakes each time the coaster passes by, at all hours day and night.\nThe only reason I give it two stars is that the room itself was ok. Too bad you won't be able to sleep in it or get food in the restaurant. It's also well located.",1
"Unfortunately for me I asked the server for something spicy and didn't even look at the menu. He suggested the seafood pasta and even said it was his favorite. \n\nBad call. The seafood was ok, the pasta was fresh, and I think it would have been worth the $33 but the problem was the sauce was from a can with a cartoon chef on it. It was sugary, pasty, bland, and as far from spicy as fruit loops are. It kinda felt like the server got a bonus for pushing that shitty dish out the door that late on a Saturday. Ick\n\nIf you don't have a spicy dish, that's ok. Just say so and I'll have the walleye (which my wife loved). \n\nWon't go back. Also tired of new strip mall designs THAT ARE SO HARD AND LOUD THAT I HAVE TO SHOUT WITH MY TABLE. Move the kitchen out of the dining room for gods sake.",1
"Surprised that this is still listed, they have been closed for a couple of years now... Hmmm..",0
"For a theme hotel, this one is really boring. You just have some statues hanging around. This is like a lesser version of Caesar's Palace, except Caesar's Palace is cool. The hotel room is decent - everything was clean and in working order. I feel like this is the forgotten hotel of the big hotels on the strip. Never in conversation with friends do we ever say, \""This one time at Monte Carlo...\"" unless we're talking about the fire on the roof.",2
"I frequently shop at the great Lee Lee market and have often eyed this restaurant, I thankfully had some time while waiting for some watch batteries to be replaced at the adjacent jewelers to eat lunch at Hop Kee.\nNow, first off I am (as they say) a woman with certain endowments who should know better than to wear a white shirt to an Asian restaurant but I really did not plan it out correctly...usually this ruins my experience 'cuz I'm such a dummy but not this time.\nSingapore noodles are sort of a hard dish-it's either oily and flavorless flourescent yellow with shoe-leather pork or an incredible marriage of char siu and curry.  Hop Kee was certainly leaning toward the latter.  I really liked this dish, so much so I wore some home without shame!!",3
ONLY COME HERE STRICTLY FOR PAGEANTS--\n\nI requested a NON smoking room but they placed me in building 11 which was a SMOKING room-- the manager is an asshole and wouldnt move me to a different building because he was FULL. I have kids-- in smoking rooms-- WOW!\n\nWish our pageants werent held in this hotel-- I hate this place.,0

"Not bad overall, but it's definitely hit or miss on the employees level of apathy. The drive thru closes earlier than most Taco Bells for some reason.",2
"I'm gonna up the stars.  It's cheap, they keep it clean, sitting in it for a couple of hours was not too bad, except it is hotter than Hades.  Even the kids are pretty well behaved.  There's a movie on the tv and fans going.  \n\nBring a cold drink and tough it out.",3
"Just got back from my second visit. First time was to get an aftermarket muffler and flange welded together that was cut instead of unbolted. Quick, friendly and no BS. Then just got a custom exhaust made. Jerry(reception) and Dave(the exhaust guy) are awesome guys. Total price was as quoted. First visit was cheaper than quoted. Highly recommended for all your exhaust needs. I know i'll be back if i need another exhaust done.",4
The waiter I had couldn't even crack smile or even come by my table. If he did come by it was once every 15 minutes. Food is always good here service sucks all the time. Also u may want to dust your big picture in your dinning area dust bunnies all over it.,0
Informative tour that put some grit behind the glamor of Frank Lloyd Wright.  I needed his innovations to be pointed out to me - I've just taken this Palm Springs style of architecture for granted.  I think HG will now be more receptive to seeing significant architecture in other cities we visit.,2
i liked  the food but after a hangover who won't eat anything! great place for hangover not have when sober. great place to people watch that's for sure!,1
"Ah, video games. I agree with Lynn and shake my finger at those people with a console. Isn't the distance between two people far enough with texting, IMing, Facebooking, tweeting, and all the other -ings out there?\n\n----gets off soapbox\n\nThis is a great store. Too bad we don't have any in SoCal since Wizards of the Coast died out. The diversity of games is excellent. They have, but not limited to (just in case I missed something)\n\n1) Traditional boardgames like chess and checkers\n2) Standard boardgames like Sorry, Monopoly and the game of Life\n3) Puzzles of all sorts like jigsaw and metal puzzles\n4) Playing cards\n5) Collectible cards like Magic the Gathering\n6) Specialized board games for the hardcore boardgame fan like Carcassone, Settlers of Catan, Axis and Allies, Descent and Runebound\n7) Specialized card games like Munchkin and Race for the Galaxy\n8) RPGs like Dungeons and Dragons\n\nSo, if staring at a screen gets old and boring, or decide that the distance between 2 people is too wide for you and you need face to face interactions with actual people, head on this way, I'm sure they'll find something you'll like.",3
"My boyfriend goes to noca regularly and we've gone there together several times. I enjoy both their lunch and dinner menus, but their lunch (nocawich) in particular. I had the Gwyneth sandwich which was accompanied by noca slaw and thoroughly enjoyed it. The slaw has a little kick to it thanks to the sriracha. \n\nWe went for Restaurant Week last night and, unfortunately, were unable to order both the Halibut and the Lamb due to a shortage of the entrees. However, this is because the owner refuses to freeze the ingredients in order to control quality, and who can fault him for that? We had to choose something else, and he graciously substituted an off-menu Branzino creation for me while my boyfriend ordered the Pork entree. We both enjoyed our meals. Before that, we ordered a tomato and arugula salad and tomato and roasted red pepper soup that had a citrus twist. This lemony twist separated it nicely from the run-of-the-mill soups made around town. Additionally, their house red and white wines were both very enjoyable. \n\nThe little \""Ho Hos\"" and doughnut desserts were enjoyable, and the jelly sauce that  accompanied the doughnuts really made them stand out. \n\nAll in all, Noca remains a favorite!",4
My 1st Dinner in Vegas on 9/11/14.  Elegant.  Great service.  I went with  3 other people.  Everyone was pleased with their entrees.,3
"The name of this place should be La Segunda Luna simply because of the fact that it felt like darkness had fallen on the restaurant and we were trapped in a solar eclipse. El Segundo Sol is located at the front of the Fashion Show Mall next to RA Sushi.\n\nWhen we first walked it, there was a sign in the front to text a number to obtain drink and food specials. It is a scam to sign up for regular spam texts pertaining to this restaurant. We thought by texting that it would give us some sort of a discount. They should be upfront up with this instead of misleading the public.\n\nThey sat us in a booth but the service was really slow. It took them a long time to get to our table to order our food, bring out our food, and especially bring out our check. It wasn't really that busy so I wonder why they were so slow. I thought my chicken fajita platter was pretty good but overall I wasn't really impressed with the restaurant due to its service and ambiance.",2
"This place gets worse and worse every time I come here- but it's the only drive thru donut shop in Queen Creek. Donuts are always cold. Drive thru service is ridiculously slow- and even the drive through configuration makes no sense. You literally have to do a loop-de-loop to: avoid cars coming out of the drivethrough and then go out the same shopping center driveway to get back on the road.  Are they taking advantage of their monopoly?  Because as soon as someone else shows up with even a little better service, DD will disappear.  To summarize some of my \""best\"" visits: chocolate cake donut with chunk missing, shortchanged me.",0
"Looking to have salad for lunch is how I found this place! The photo on Yelp of their Caprese salad was tempting me, browsed through other pictures, everything looked visually appealing as well. So made the decision to have lunch here and Im very happy I did!\n\nThe food Ive tried so far rocks! Caprese Salad and their Beef Kebabs was my order.\n\nCaprese Salad - Layered with fresh mozz, grilled eggplant and ripe tomatoes and sprinkled with basil. Loved it. The cheese was fresh, creamy and tender. Real simple salad but delish!\n\nBeef Kebabs - There was an option for beef kebabs as a wrap or combo plate with veggies and ricel pilaf. I chose the combo of healthy proteins, starches and veggies.  Beef kebabs were nice thick chunky cuts of nicely seasoned beef that are fired grilled. It also came with a Tahini sauce that was made from scratch for dipping. Loved it! The portion sizes are average and fit the prices they charge which is moderate. Both dishes I had were under $10 each. Which is pretty affordable for the specialties they offer here.\n\nAmbiance/Service - Delightful describes my dining experience!! It's a relaxed feel where Frank Sinatra and 40's tunes are piped in. Cherry-wood tables and chairs. Natural light filters in through the floor to ceiling windows that surround the place. Love the hand painted wall art. How sweet and thoughtful they have a little area dedicated for the little ones to dine/play too, so moms (and or dads ) can relax and unwind a bit with a glass of wine.  \n\nIt's a family owned business. The host/server that initially seated me was at the end of her shift, so Albert and Tony took over and did a great job! I also had the pleasure to meet the Chef Ash and the Bon Chef Cafe crew. All take great pride at what they do and they do it very well!  I cant wait go back to try the Baked Lobster Bisque that's topped off with a puff pastry. I know Im in for a culinary treat when I dine here!",4
"I was on a Vegas business trip and found good reviews of this place on yelp. Even on a Monday night they had over an hour wait, but I was able to get immediately seated at the bar as a solo diner. \n\nI had great service from the busy but efficient bartender. I really liked the grand marnier infused manhattan - a strong drink with just a touch of sweetness - very good. For dinner I had the pork medallions based on a recomendation. I was welcomed with the chef's carrot slaw and warm bread. The dinner was beautifully presented and delicious! The pork melted in your mouth and had a very flavorful wine sauce and was accompanied by an equally delicious stuffed tomatoe. The dinner was very reasonably priced. I almost ate there again on night 2, and went someplace with higher prices and not as good of a meal - so now I wish I had returned!",4
"Amazing view! Great food, great service by Maggie and Team. Always a positive experience. It would be ideal if new dishes were brought in every now and again. Healthy options like the seared ahi previously offered would come back. Thanks!",3
"Ahh Luxor. You and I have had some great times together.\n\nI have stayed at the Luxor once before in my younger years and I thoroughly enjoyed it and a lot of my long-lasting Vegas memories are here.\n\nDuring our most recent trip to Vegas we did visit the Luxor again. Not to stay but explored everything within to make all those memories come rushing back. Took an elevator up to the room floors to see out onto the concourse (a must do for anyone visiting)\n\nWe visited, and yes, deposited some money into the casino which is nicely tucked underneath the exciting main floor that the rooms overlook. The waitresses in the Luxor are great to serve drinks while playing. They have plenty of fun games to lose your cash to and did we ever.\n\nWe also came to eat breakfast at \""More\"" the buffet at Luxor with another two for one pass from MyVegas and the MLife app they have created. (That review to follow)\n\nBut my girlfriend and I agree, Luxor is and probably always will be one of the most exciting looking buildings in Las Vegas.",3
"Great new place in Cave Creek!  CCOOC's website boasts that they have \""the highest quality oils and balsamics from all over the world.\""  Well, I love both and have done many tastings so trust me when I say, they have a great selection of the best oils and balsamics I've tasted! Everything was so true to the label; bold and flavorful. This will be my new go-to place when I want quality o & b!",4
"Had a great birthday dinner here.  It's a splurge but I had a Groupon that made it doable.  We had a great server and the manager was very friendly.\n\nMeat quality seems to be mentioned in every review.  I'm a picky foodie; at home I cook from scratch with good quality local, organic, grass-fed beef, organic happy chickens, etc.  The meat we were served was good quality and sliced well for fondue dipping.  Were I to guess I'd say USDA choice.  It's lean meat though, and from mostly from mild cuts that aren't very tough to begin with and won't toughen up if you leave them in the pot for too long.  So you really want to use the sauces they provide.  Also ask for salt and salt your meat before cooking.\n\nWhat I really liked was how food-sensitivity/allergy friendly they are.  One of my dining companions has multiple food sensitivities and both the server and manager were awesome in making sure that we ordered properly.  The whole restaurant seems very well set up for protecting against cross contamination.\n\nI also asked about gluten-free dining if only one person in a small party was GF and the rest of the table wanted to eat gluten.  They said the best thing to do is to make a reservation 3-4 days out and let them know that you'll need to be seated at a table with 2 burners so that one person can have a pot that doesn't get cross-contaminated.",3
"So, I am giving the 3 because of service.\n\nThe food was very good. The pizza is a individual pizza, but more than enough if you order an appetizer. My girlfriend and I wanted to try Porch and decided tonight would be a great night to go. \n\nWe each ordered a glass of wine. When I ordered my wine the server Nick questioned my order saying \""That is a sweet wine\"".  Yes sir, I know what wine I want to drink tonight with my pizza. We then ordered the Farm Bread appetizer with Honey Butter, Apple Butter, and Fig, as well as the Bianca Pizza with goat cheese and figs. Nick made sure to comment about our order expressing his opinion about the small amount of food we ordered. \n\nOur bread came out 5 minutes later; Nick did not explain which spread was which and just walked away. We still did not have our wine. The manager walked by our table looking for our wine glasses, noticed we did not have any and delivered our wine.\n\nBy the time our pizza came our water jug was empty. Nick did not ask us how our bread or wine was. He did not ask if we needed anything else. The pizza was as we expected. Small enough for one hungry person to eat, but large enough for 2 people not looking to stuff their faces. \n\nOur meal is now over. Nick comes to us with a small jar with our check inside. He asks if there is anything else he can do for the night, we said no and he gave us the check. Our plates are empty and nicely placed by the end of the table to be cleared. I am calculating the tip I want to give him since our food was brought out in a timely manner and was an excellent meal. However, I was not sure how much to tip for the service I received. We decided on a 15% tip and I rounded up to make the total bill a round dollar. While doing this Nick came by and looked over my shoulder. When I was done signing the check my girlfriend was still finishing her wine, and I joked \""Watch him come take the signed check.\"" Lo and behold Nick walks by, swiftly grabbing the jar, never clearing the table, and without a \""Good Night\"" or \""Thank you\"", he was gone....\n\nWatching other servers, I know Porch has some good staff. It is a shame that I was given such a bad server for my first experience there.",2
"From someone born and raised in Vegas I was not impressed, not sure how or why the Lvrj gave them an award for best bar food, it was definitely not the best I've had. I'm giving them two stars for a cool atmosphere and I like the old Vegas pics but not the best spot for food, maybe just for a drink and to hang out.",1
"So, continuing my story.  If you're interested, see their other listing for Part I:\n\nOkay, so a bad experience...nightmare over, enjoy the trip.\n\nSo, the receipt gives instructions to call the day before to schedule your return trip to the airport.  I remembered this after dinner on the eve of my departure and call the number...on hold, \""we'll get to your call in the order that is was received\""...23 minutes later...got some plans to keep, will call in the morning.\n\nNext day: My flight is 7:15 pm, I call at 9:30 am to, again, try to schedule my return back to the airport.  Someone answers after only about 1 minute of hold time, okay...maybe the trip from the airport and the phone thing last night is just a fluke.  The guy is actually pretty nice, but when I tell him about trying to call last night, no apology is offered, just that \""we were really busy and there aren't that many of us\""...wow, really?!?  I am just thankful not to be yelled at!  So, I am offered either the 4:15 shuttle or the 5:00 shuttle.  \""I'll take the 5 o'clock because I don't want to wait around at the airport\""...he says he understands and he confirms my hotel and makes sure I know where to go to get the shuttle.  \n\n4:55 pm, bags in hand, I make my way to the shuttle area and pace up and down the walkway, nervous that the vehicle is here already and I don't want to get left behind.  Not seeing it, I put my bags down, confirm with the valet that I am in the right area and have a seat...the valet nods and says it'll be either in this or that spot..\""cool, thanks\"".  I wait by myself as hundreds of people board several other buses and shuttles and I diligently look out for my ride.  I look at my watch 5:10, 5:15...no shuttle.  I am getting nervous about my flight time getting closer and decide to give the company a call.  I explain the situation to the operator and she asks, \""um, can I put you on hold?\"".  While listening to the on-hold message, I could hear that someone has picked up my line, but has placed me back on hold 3 times...2 minutes later, the steam is starting to seep out of my ears again!  \n\nShe comes back on the line, \""Uh, sir, we have your confirmation number, but do not have you scheduled for a pick-up today\""\nI say, \""So...what does that mean?\""  \n\""I show you have a reservation for pick up, but it's for October 17th\""\n\""OK, it's Oct. 6th, that's a week and a half away.  There must be a mistake, I made the reservation this morning for TONIGHT.\""  \nShe replies, \""Nope, you made it for the 17th.\""  \nI try to stay calm, \""OK so what are my options; I really need to get to the airport.\""  \n\""That's up to you, we won't be able to help you out because it's too close to your boarding time.\""  \nI spot one of their vehicles pulling up to the hotel to drop off some passengers.  \""Oh, one of your shuttles is pulling up now.  Can I hop onto that one.\""  \n\""No, because it's not the shuttle you have reservations for.\""\n\""So, how do I get to the airport to catch my flight?\""\n\""I suggest you catch a cab to make sure you get there on time.\""\n\""Is there any compensation from you company for the money I paid to you for the round trip ticket and for the taxi fare I am about to pay.\""\n\""Not really because it's your error for not making your reservation correctly.  You can try to write a complaint and request a refund.\""\n\nCall over, NEVER considering doing business with them again...AND I would STRONGLY recommend that NO one else give them business, UNLESS you want to be publicly humiliated, you enjoy being told you did something you know you didn't do AND you want to miss your flight!  Other than those things, I guess my experience was OK...LOL!\n\nI usually wouldn't even write a negative review, but since every part of the experience was bad, I owed it to all the people that use YELP.  Since Showtime has two separate listings, I wanted to make sure that both get equal representation of my horrible experiences  After browsing through all the reviews, I guess the company knows they are on the way out and has to try to keep every penny they can collect.",0

We waited the full 60 min, but was told they were having trouble getting a big enough spot to seat us all together & it would Be 10-15 more minutes. We were compensated for our time, so we gladly waited. \nThe manger took great care of us & our waitress was superb! \nWe placed orders for the Chicago style pan Numero-one pizza while we waited. They were ready by the time we got seated. Big dinner & caesar Salads, thin crust  Sproccoli pizza were fresh, delicious, & very flavorful! Top off the evening with our favorite part of the meal... Pizza cookies, One of each please! I must say, white chocolate macadamia nut & peanut butter are my favorite! They will even do half/half for you too! Each birthday gal/guy got a free pazookie!!

"In the unlikely event the dead ever managed to get to sleep in this hotel, the toilets, flushing, would wake them.\n\nThe toilet paper would take paint off walls, which, incidentally, needs doing.\n\nIn most rooms, the sink is in an alcove separate from the toilet, which is problematic if you like to wash your hands after going. \n\nThe water temperature in the shower ranges from scalding to ice cold, with a millimeter's difference between the two.\n\nIn an 18-story hotel, the Wi-Fi doesn't work above the 9th floor.\n\nNice lobby, friendly staff.

"The Man and I are big into our sauna/steam rooms.  Ever since a trip to Harrogate's Turkish Baths, we've been hooked.  So, when we discovered that the Portobello Swim Centre had its own mini Turkish bath, we were there in a flash.\n\nAs expected, compared to Harrogate, the price was pretty reasonable.  I believe it was \u00a36.50 a head for as long as you like, and you could use the pool as well.  \n\nHowever, also as expected, the facilities certainly weren't as nice.  It's clean and in no way NOT nice, but the warmer spaces were pretty small and even though there weren't many people there, they felt a bit crowded at times.\n\nMy biggest issue was the temperature.  There should be a tepid room, a warm room (warm enough to perspire) and a hot room.  Instead the rooms could more accurately be described as tepid, cool and cooler.  The hottest room in the Portobello centre was like with the coolest room in the Harrogate centre.  \nThis meant that, instead of having a steam room and a series of temperature different saunas, the centre just had a steam room and a warm-ish area.  \n\nWhile it was still a nice and relaxing experience, I'm not sure how quickly I would return because I didn't feel it gave the user the full Turkish bath experience.",2
"Creepiest place ever. Just had my first and last experience here. I have NO clue how they're in business. Starting with the fact that there's NO ONE in there ..bad sign number one.\n\nWent here based on convenience and yelp ... Wasn't going to get biscuits and gravy so I could care less about that.\n\nSo, if you're iced tea tastes funny, I'm convinced you haven't had or passed a health inspection in a while. JUST SAYIN\n\nI think the menu has some good ideas, however, execution is questionable and staff (mother daughter?) are weird as hell... I have flashbacks of the Hills Have Eyes. Pretty sure our waitress was on some sort or drug and literally made me want to spit my food out.\n\nI'm giving this place 1 star because we had a waitress who took our order and the food and bill came out correctly.\n\nI honestly feel bad for this place, but I also feel it's only fair to let people know my opinion and experience... YOU BE THE JUDGE, if you dare.",0
"I was in desperate need of a haircut yesterday and hopped on Yelp to look for a good barber in the area I was in.  There were a number of 4 and five star rated shops, but for some reason the reviews for Cliff's stood out.\n\nI think my hair is pretty easy to cut (very short), but for some reason, I haven't been able to find a good barber in the 15 years I've lived here.  I think my search is over.  Cliff was super friendly and gave me exactly what I asked for.  In fact, he knew what I wanted before I told him.  Cliff seems to be a really good guy and the shop is very unique.  You won't find another shop like it.  He also has really good hours: 8am to 7pm seven days a week.  Regardless of your schedule, you could be able to make it in.\n\nIf you're in need of a new barber like I was, give Cliff's a try.",4
"Early in our relationship, Belle confessed to me that she didn't like tacos or meatloaf.  This was, of course, a serious problem.  Some homemade pulled pork tacos later one of the hurdles was cleared, but the meatloaf issue continued to vex me.  Enter Avenue B.\n\nFirst off, don't let the largely unfinished web site turn you off.  Avenue B has a much more expansive menu that what you'll find online.  Thankfully, the above-mentioned meatloaf is a mainstay (although its exact composition changes seasonally).  You'll find ~6 starters and ~6 entrees on the chalk board menu, most of which are made, to one degree or another, to highlight local and seasonal fare.  Quick aside: assuming you remember your own wine, this is a pretty good place in terms of menu and atmosphere for a date.  Just know that they don't give you menus, you have to rely on the chalkboards.  Not every seat has a great sightline to the boards, so don't make your date sit in a chair so she has to awkwardly crane her neck to figure out what she wants to eat.  And for God's sake don't (as I did) forget your glasses and resort to having your date read to you.  Belle was understanding, but for an early date, I was hoping to come across as something other than quasi-literate.\n\nAll the meals I've had at Avenue B have been very good.  The cook obviously knows what he's doing; his previous spot (the Red Room) really took off under his guidance.  That said, the menu is not going to blow anyone's mind when it comes to pushing the envelope with unusual preparations and/or ingredients.  Take a closer look at the menu picture from the yelp profile and you'll see:\nRoast Chicken\nBraised Short Ribs\nNY Strip Steak\nFalafel and Tabouleh\nSeared Scallops\nBBQ\n-not pictured, but also on the menu:\nFish and Chips\nMeatloaf.\n\nNot really very vegetarian-friendly and not really separating itself from the crowd.  There are, of course, excellent reasons from a financial standpoint to play it safe when it comes to Pittsburgh menus, but I think the city's tastes are slowly changing and I hope Avenue B steers its obvious skill in more interesting directions down the line.  All that said, if you like these things (and I certainly do), Avenue B does an excellent job with them.  On visit 1, I ordered the meatloaf and loved it--it was probably the best meatloaf I've ever had (with apologies to my father).  After much cajoling, I convinced Belle to have a bite.  On our most recent visit, Belle ordered the meatloaf for herself, which stands as testimony to how well Avenue B executes the \""new American bistro\"" catalog.",3
"I've always loved Southwest Airlines since I was a little girl. From flying by myself to flying in groups, they have always made my experiences wonderful. There are so many great flight attendants, no matter what time of day it is. I definitely recommend southwest, also because if you become a frequent flyer and get a certain amount of points, you get a \""companion pass\"" which allows you to bring someone for free!! We love it! And with our baby being under 2 years of age, we BOTH fly free. So it's 3 for the price of one! It's all around a great airline!",4
"Great food, poor service. We waited over an hour for our food and no one seemed to care. (On a Monday night)",1
"I was in Vegas for a conference earlier this week. My colleague and I stumbled across Jaelo as we were walking through The Cosmopolitan. Quite frankly we chose it because of the funky, interesting atmosphere.\n\nBut wow...the FOOD. Every single thing we tried was amazing...the garlic shrimp, skirt steak, veal cheeks...all of it. And the servie was great.\n\nI would recommend and definitely go back again.",4
After looking around for few days in town finally ended up here. Best service good food. This will be my meal for the rest of the stay in North carolina. Best of all I tried around this area.,4
The food was horrible.,0
"This is the first time I've had frozen yogurt with popping boba.  It's kind of like eating those Gushers fruit snacks, there's a gush of juicy liquid that I'm not quite sure if I like in my frozen yogurt, but I do appreciate that they offer it.  All the toppings here are very fresh, and they have a very wide selection of flavors for the yogurt.",3
We love Serrano's. Even had them cater our wedding.  We were regulars @ the Dobson location before it closed.\n\nReally not a fan of this location.  Service is poor.\n\nToday my mother and I tried to walk in with the remnants of our coffees and before we were even all the way in the door were told by two employees that we'd have to leave our drinks at the front. Rude.\nWe left and spent our $40 @ Valle Luna. It was delicious!,2
I was accommodated with a change in time and party size. This was the best that night.\nMy server Alison was trying to deal with mishaps by her support staff all night. I apologized to her for that. My issues? My full bottle of wine came to the table Pre-Opened? Curious. Mussels were too salty. Couldn't taste the mussels at all. Pizza with added prochutto was over cooked. I passed on desert because I didn't want three failures in a row for this evening. Good effort by some with disappointing results.,1
"I have never encountered such horrible customer service! I have very long hair and have been thinking about cutting about 10 inches off and before I did wanted to try out a wig to make sure I wouldn't hate the short look on me. I went into wig land hoping to find a wig I could test out for a couple of weeks but the lady working said I couldn't try on most of the wigs because my hair was too long. So when I asked what I could try on and told her my reason for wig shopping, she told me I couldn't try on anything and that her wigs are \""not for play\"" and if I want to cut my hair to just cut it. Even after I tried to explain that I wanted to buy a wig she just keep saying I couldn't try on anything. She was extremely rude and I would never recommend this store to anyone!",0
"I was drawn to this place by my nose. If you have walked around Santan Mall you know what smell I am talking about. Sweet bbq smell, it drew me in. The place is fun and casual. The prices are good and their is a lot of variety on the menu. I shared a two meat combo with my bf. They brought out the wrong order for us, but I caught it and they brought the right order. The food was good especially the potatoes. Nothing was too special though and I doubt I will come back. The service from the people who took our names down to the waitress were eh-ok.",2
This place is awesome. Inexpensive and really good. Super friendly people. The owner Nick is a super nice guy and made us feel so much like family we went back the next day and ate there again. Cant wait to go back out to Vegas to eat there again.,4
"Came here for the second time despite having a difficult experience the first time. Expect mediocre service and waitresses who care more about eating their ice cream than taking your order..... Let alone the right order. The first time around we had to ask for refills on drinks and waited around to get our check processed while they were busy talking amongst themselves. We were the only people in the restaurant and we had to ask to be served. Doesn't make much sense to me. \n\nThis time around I gave them a second shot. Their spaghetti and meatball lunch special was yummy like the first time around but the thin crust pizza was good but not that good. We ordered pepperoni, mushrooms, and sausage and ended up with pepperoni, mushrooms, and a massive amount of onions. The onions made the rest of the pizza taste like Dominos ( the boyfriend said this ). He really wanted to try their home made sausage on the pizza so we are still waiting. Other than that, the service was still lacking even though we were one of two tables in the restaurant. I would be disappointed but fool me once shame on you......fool me twice shame on me. \n\nAs far as recommending this place.... I would say make sure you come when a good waiter/waitress is here. I wouldn't know if they have one. But the food is worth it just as long as you want waitresses who is concerned more with their ice cream as your food dies in the window. /harsh. I know.",2
The food quality was amazing!! The service was well above par and the atmosphere was great! I felt welcomed by the staff and as was treated if i was the only consumer there. I will definitely be back for some more of those delicious tacos. Highly recommend this to anyone who is interested in quality mexican food and great service!,4
"I was going to keep this place to myself, but I thought that not very many people come here for Movie Theater reviews so what the heck here goes.\n\nWe are sooo lucky to have this relatively rare second run theater in the valley. It's the only one and has been converted to digital!\n\nThat's key since the old second run theaters used  get mangled, worn out movie prints that made the discount price not worth the effort. But with all digital projection it's exactly the same as the expensive first run theater. So if you can wait 2 or 3 months you only pay:\nGeneral Admission $2.00 \nAll Day Tuesday $1.00 \n3D Admission $3.50\nFOR THE EXACT SAME EXPERIENCE! \n\nThe sound and 3-D is identical.\n\nObviously there is no IMax screen but I never found it worth shelling out all that dough. \n\nTheater features rocking leatherette seats with high backs, and movable arms with cup holders. It is relatively clean and does not smell despite some of the older comments listed here.\n\nOh and it's less than a mile up Trop from that great Taco joint everyone's talking about: http://www.yelp.com/biz/taco-tijuana-las-vegas\n\nAgain these second run theaters have become scarce due to the high cost of converting to digital. So this one's a real gem.\n\nBe advised that due to the low price there can be kids and babies in the audience. Go to the late shows to avoid them.",3
"The customized cupcake I got here on 5/16/10 was sooooo yummy. \n\nI got:\n-vanilla cupcake\n-coconut creme filling \n-white chocolate frosting\n-purple butterfly ring\n\nIt was $3.23 for one cupcake, but you can get a dozen of them for a cheaper price. \n\nThe place was empty on a Sunday afternoon and the waitress was nice. I would go here again for this special treat.",3
"I have done some very ungodly like things at this place. And I must say... it can go from dead to PACKED in 30 minutes, its rather amazing. \nI've only gone to Zuma's on Monday nights (I work at a nightclub, so those are the only days we have off) and its still pretty poppin' for Mondays, plus you have Chris Villa as a DJ on Mondays, so how could you go wrong? \n\nI also came here for Saint Patricks day which was great., they had 5 dollar shots of jameson (my favorite) and green beer! One of the only places on Mill that didnt have a cover which is always a selling point for me. \n*SQUIRREL* Returning to my review..........\n\nGETTING THERE. \nI live in North Phoenix so its a pain in the butt to get down to Mill, especially when I know I'll be drinking and parking can be less than favorable. Well, if you park at I want to say University and Mill (right next to firehouse?) theres a student parking lot with visitor parking too! I believe after 10pm you dont have to pay for parking till the morning, so its a smart way to get out of those meters. And btw, when I left my car parked in that lot for 2 days cause I couldnt find a ride back down to mill, I returned to a ticket on my vehicle..... SAD FACE. When I looked at the fine total is was 0.00... HAPPY FACE!\n\nDRINK. DRANK. DRUNK. \nYou can get these ridiculously large drinks for 10 dollars, its like a personal pitcher of liquor. I cant remember what these damn things are called...but theres a chalkboard above the bar that describes the different ones you can order. \n\nI always run into promotion girls here, which is also cool. Who hates being given free alcohol and merchandise? I mean, my Wild Turkey bottle opener keychain has been a lifesaver multiple times. \n\nONE LAST THING...... Who is that ridiculously handsome bartender that works there? If you've been there... you know who I'm talking about. Hes like 6 feet tall and resembles a Ken doll. I think half of my income has gone to him in tips just hoping to get a wink. My mouth waters! yum yum yum.",3
"I went on a Saturday afternoon. I usually get food for my co-workers and we've been curious to try this place out because it was a diamond in the otherwise rough Indian School Rd. area. I got to the drive-thru at 2:30, thinking that it would be quicker than going in.  I had to be at work at 3, so no problem. Boy, was I so wrong.\n\nAs I arrived at the speaker-box, the employee immediately told me to hang on a moment as he was busy with the current customer at the window. No problem: new store, new employees, new things to learn, I understand. \n\nThen ... silence. 5 minutes later, still no response. Cars were starting to pile up behind me so I finally asked if I could order and this is the reply, 'Oh ... yeah, I forgot you were there.'  Cool brah, my self-esteem thanks you. \n\nI ordered a dulche de leche shake, the short rib and chicken tacos, and the burger with fries. When I rolled up to the window, the younger man working the register tells me to wait, again, as the card machine wasn't working and my food would take a little bit. Understatement of the year.\n\nIt's 2:55 now and I'm wondering if they're plucking the chicken feathers and scraping the meat off of bones back there because that's the only excuse for having to wait so long. When they finally work things out and hand me my food,  I end up late to work, hastily give out the food to my co-workers, and sneakily eat my own burger behind the counter. \n\nBasically: I don't see the difference in buying a burger from here or 5 Guys even though they say it's made with different ingredients. Both are the same high prices (when you take toppings into account), same patty size, don't come with fries, and they both have excessive juice/oil dripping down my hand. Fries taste exactly like the salt and pepper Boulder Canyon chips except they went a little heavy with the black pepper, and when I asked my co-workers if they enjoyed the tacos, they told me next time to save my money and go to Tacos Sahuayo nearby for something tastier and cheaper. \n\nThe only thing i can compliment them on is the dulche de leche shake, but anything else is just alright, nothing special. I hate it when everyone else has a good experience and I'm the odd one out :[",1
"I had heard such great things about Port of Subs from my co-workers so I decided to check it out.  I like that the meats are sliced fresh.  I think the bread tasted like packaged bread you would buy at the store.  I do like the options of potato or macaroni salad instead of chips.  And I do like that they have 20 oz drinks, not just fountain.  For the price and size, I think Jersey Mike's is way better.",1
"The beer selection is limited to what you might find in convince store (in states where this is possible. Sandwiches are Pittsburgh landmarks though and the food is good but nothing truly special. Great place to hang with friends, catch a game and chow down.",2
Yappy Happy Hour is the 3rd Thursday of every month.  It cost s 10 bucks to get in but you get a ticket for a free beer or house wine.  The money goes to support the animal foundation and you can bring your dog to come and hang out for happy hour!  Supper fun!,4
"Basic boring Tex Mex, but hey the place was packed. They know what brings them in, so who am I to judge.  \n\nThere were some nice touches that bring it up a notch or two over similar restaurants - generous use of cilantro, pickled onions and cactus salad with the carnitas - but they were negated by the over cooked carnitas meat, packaged corn tortillas and tasteless Huevos Rancheros. \n\nThe restaurant itself is huge and colorfully appointed; service is very good. The bill for lunch was very inexpensive. Despite everything this is actually one of the better choices around Northlake; but that says more about the dearth of good dining options in that area.",2
"I have been going to Dr. Parva & Dr. Ford (the owners) for years, following them around town. When I heard they were opening their own place I was like \""YAY\"" when they said it was at Higley and Pecos I was like \""BOOOOO\"". However, I still make the 30 minute drive from Tempe to get the best veterinary care I have found in my 30 + years on this planet (and in AZ).\n\nTo give you an example, when I had to put my dog down a couple of months ago, the whole place was crying. THE WHOLE PLACE. They always take their time with you and your pet, explaining everything thoroughly so you understand whats going on and what you may be up against. Another example is a looong time ago my cat was sick with kidney disease, it was a Sunday and he was hurting. I got a hold of Dr. Parva and she met me up at the Vet on her way back from Tucson to put him down. She knew how upset I was and didn't make me pay or make decisions at that time (they did bill me so don't expect a freebie), but it was comforting to know she was there when I needed her and she cared and trusted me enough to know I just needed to grieve.\n\nI can't say enough about this place, the tech and front desk are loving and amazing, the doctors are FABULOUS and I just love them all so much.",4
"I am only giving this school a three based on the faculty. I have had some great professor's here and met some great people. The classes are small and it's easy to get one on one attention. My academic advisor is young but she knows her stuff. \n\nNow that I have given the good, let's look at \""needs improvement\"" I don't want to use terrible or bad. Financial Aid is a total joke. They give you the run around on your grants in hoping you will forget it. I am a disabled vet and I could have chosen any school (wish I did). They want to keep balances on your account so that they have an excuse to keep your grants. If you have a chance to go anywhere else please do so. These \""for profit\"" schools need to be abolished. \n\nSo I'm not one to down anyone getting an education I will just say this: they are to expensive to be charging all this money for 5 week classes, they don't own their own building, they try to monitor your printing now, they don't want you to print your book (but you paid for it) AND finally, they can't keep anyone in financial aid to work (go figure)\n\nRUN AS FAST AS YOU CAN and DO YOUR RESEARCH FIRST!",2
"I FINALLY got around to visiting this tiny boutique.  Unfortunately, as much as I found in there that I liked and wanted, I probably won't be back any time soon to actually buy anything.  I was glad to have a generous gift certificate from my sister to spend! \n\nLike everyone else said - things here are REALLY pricey.  There were a few handmade things that I could understand having a high price, but.... $90 for a wallet??  Yikes.  Don't get me wrong, I know local stuff costs more, I just didn't think it cost THAT MUCH more...\n\nI can see myself coming back when I'm looking to treat myself to some unique jewelry or when I'm looking for a special gift for a close friend or family member.  Sadly, though, it won't be added into my rotation when I head out to shop.",2
"Ok I was very skeptical about this place. The room I booked on Expedia said I was getting a Manager Special and it showed the room with the pool table. When I got there to check in they said that was a suite and expedia posted the wrong room. Expedia and the Artisan just blamed each other. They basically scam you into thinking you are getting a certain room and when you get there to check in you get the shaft no apoligies or upgrades or nothing.  My Woman has a degree in Art History so she really loves this place. The food at the restaurant was superb!!!!! We were the only ones in there eating on a Tuesday night around 8pm. If you need a Cab it taked a while since non are stationed outside the Hotel. Only a short 5 minute ride to the strip. All in all we would stay there again. Heck my room wa sonly $20.00 per night plus resort. And one more thing, I was there when the Lakers were playing the Celtics and I had just arrived thinking I could catcht he game in the Bar. NO DICE, thye do not play any sports in the bar, just some old black n white movies",3
"After securing our reservation for a party of 5 on Thankgiving evening, I was very excited to finally get to try Sage. \nTalk about deceiving-- from the front, near the Aria lobby, the restaurant looks as if it will be very small and quaint inside. UH, NO. Being led into the main dining area, be prepared to be whisked away into a palatial-style room, complete with high ceilings, pillars, dim lighting, and purple and yellow-gold notes of light characterizing most of the room. I give 5 big stars for the superb ambiance and atmosphere! \nTIP: If you consider yourself a true \""foodie,\"" this will be your heaven; most, if not all, of our dishes were notably unique (and sometimes \""too\"" unique...I'll get to that later). \n\nService seemed to lag a bit at first, but picked up as the night went on. Bread choices were brought around the room by the waitstaff; that night's options were a sourdough and a country white bread of some sort. While good, it was not very memorable (I tend to obsess about the bread at upper-scale restaurants...love me some carbs!) \nWarning/TIP: The chef seems to have some kind of fetish/fixation with gelatin-izing several accompaniments to dishes (and even some dishes as a whole, like our dessert). Here we go. \n\n::Food::\n \n*Starters:\n--Sashimi of Yellowtail ($21): Absolutely delectable, melt-in-your-mouth yellowtail. This starter was accompanied with delicious smoked apple puree and some squash. The cons? Baby portions. My dad and I split this item and we each got about two bites of the sashimi. \n\n--Roasted Pumpkin Soup ($16): The best I've ever had at a restaurant. Very simple yet complex flavors (oxymoron, whatever) overcame my senses with every bite. Like other high-class establishments, they first brought out a bowl with just a few pieces of solid food; here, there were mini-raviolis and a scatter of vegetables, I believe. They they proceeded to bring a silver pitcher filled with the soup and filled each bowl. Very nice presentation. Unfortunately, I don't think they have this item anymore (a shame, as it was perhaps the most memorable part). \n\n--Roasted Wild Mushrooms ($21): I mean...it's what you would expect. I, however, am very partial to different varieties of mushrooms and these were fantastic. The dish was complete with pine nuts and a few greens. \n\n*Main Dishes: \n--Grilled American Kobe Skirt Steak ($51): PLEASE GET THIS! What a delightful surprise. Our waitress recommended this over the other meat option (NY Strip) with the advice that \""the NY Strip you can get anywhere else, but the skirt steak is unlike anything else you will ever have anywhere else.\"" ...Okaaayyy, we're sold. When I first read that it was skirt steak, I was a little skeptical; I've never had much luck with it. This steak was almost like that of a prime bone-in filet: tender, can essentially be cut with a fork, and has loads of flavor like a NY or even ribeye. Once again, the accompaniments were very intriguing, but still tasty. The crispy sweet potato puree was really like little fried balls of smooth sweet potato. The whole table loved them, but there was a spice in it that I wasn't particularly fond of. It also came served with a honey-roasted radicchio and a pecan type of glaze. Bravo on this one, Sage. \n\n--Morro Bay Black Cod ($43): Another stunning winner. I enjoy black cod because of its mild flavor, and this one was no different. So smooth! Tip...if you're with some..er, older citizens who might not be able to chew very well, take the initiative and order them this dish. We seriously didn't even have to chew the fish, it just fell apart and disintegrated in our mouths (okay maybe not that far..but you know what I mean). \nAaaaand, enter the gelatinous food stage. Alongside the fish was a strip of yellow, omelette colored \""gunk\"" of sorts. This was our first encounter with the aforementioned gelatin-textured food. This yellow rectangle was a sweet pumpkin puree of sorts, and was actually pretty good. Just an odd texture that confused my taste buds and mouth? In addition, the pancetta gave the fish a nice kick of salt, and don't forget the smoked green grapes! Incredibly unique for such a simple concept.  \n\n\n*Dessert\n--Gingerbread Cremeux ($12): Strange. Strange. STRANGE. This is really what cemented in my mind the idea of the chef slaving over making every dish have some kind of gelatinous element. THIS WAS ALL GELATINOUS. I know it might sound kind of bratty, but this was just a huge fail, in my opinion. It was like a harder version of shaped pudding, in a ribbon the width of a fettuccine noodle. Uhhh.\n\nFinal disappointment: Our family friend and I got their french press coffee at the end (very good coffee), and my mom asked for a small cup because she just wanted to taste it. There was maybe 2 oz. left in the press. They still charged her for the cup ($5!). I'm sorry, but nickle-and-dime-ing a table at a restaurant of this caliber is pathetic. \n\nOverall, Sage is definitely worth a try! Especially for foodies.",3
"I am calling BullSh#* on Jessica K's review. I have been to the office plenty times!

Ortho retainers are not cheap, why didn't Jessica go back to her Orthodontist? \n\nVery nice office and staff! You do not feel like you are part of the production game.",4
"Um... seriously?! Seriously, Phoenix?! You are in desperate need of a decent boba place, STAT!!!\n\nI LOVE BOBA and at this point, I guess you can say I'm an amateur boba connoisseur because I drink it so often and have been to almost every boba place (in the world! hahahhaa jk).\n\nAnyway, being in Phoenix for almost a week, my boba craving was getting outta control, so The Boyfriend and I found this place and drove 10 miles out to quench my thirst. \n\nI was pretty disappointed in the lack of options... I think their menu consisted of 10 boba drinks. I got the milk tea with boba and oh man, where do I start with all the things that were wrong with it?! Lemme just give the 2 basic but very important errors in this milk tea:\n\n1. The milk tea itself was way too sweet. It was sickenly sweet to the point that it was bordering on barely resembling the taste of milk tea.\n2. The boba was oh-so obviously day old boba that they had reheated (most likely in the microwave). That is the number one NO-NO to a boba shop. Don't use old boba... you're disgracing boba places everywhere.\n\nAnyway, It gets 2 stars for having the guts to be the lone boba place in Phoenix area.\n\nBut if I ever move down there, I am going to give you a lesson or two on how to make decent boba.",1
"The service was impeccable and the ambiance was fabulous, but unfortunately we had a terrible experience with the food. I've heard great things about this restaurant for years and was excited to try it. Everything was beautiful, but every dish we ordered was just average. The potatoes were creamy but too rich to eat, and my salmon (or the sauce on the salmon) had obviously gone bad. It tasted moldy! Everyone in my party who ordered the salmon experienced this. The vegetables were steamed simply, which I'm fine with, but as I was unable to eat anything else on my plate they weren't enough to write home about. The bread pudding was too sweet to eat, and had an unpleasant consistency. I was with a large group and we all ordered the bread pudding, but no one was able to eat it! An incredibly expensive meal for low quality food. Skip the menu, have a drink at the beautiful bar.",2
"The gym has a lot of things to vary your workout with machines and free weights, a track, Jacuzzi, sauna, steam room and pool. There is tons of equipment in this place and this gym is huge. \n\nThe attitude throughout the gym feels pretty snobby and the staff won't provide much personal service. You literally have to crawl over and weave around people constantly to get to the free weights and machines in the free weight room. It always crowded and filled with meat heads who love to groan while they lift and throw chalk all over the place or gaze into the mirror while they flex their  \""guns\"". Don't get me wrong there are a lot of beautiful people that come out for this fashion show, so if that is something that helps you stay motivated this might be your place. \n\nThe parking lot is massive to accommodate the overcrowded gym.  They do have a smoothie bar which  which has tons of good food and smoothies, however it is very overpriced.",1
"Echo Coffeehouse is off of 68th Street and Thomas in a brand new building shell.  They did a great job with the TI's and are right across the street from TT's Roadhouse. \n\nMy wife and I stop there because it is a convenient place to meet, always has parking and they do a great job with the coffee (I get Iced Coffee; she gets Tea or water) and an even better job on the sandwiches.  I recommend either the Tuna Sandwich (made of white beans/tuna/light olive oil on flat bread) or the Curry Chicken.  Both times we ate there the food was fresh, well made and well presented.  I recommend this place to anyone who likes well-made, light lunches with a good, cold coffee drink.  \n\nWhat would give it FIVE stars would be for it to survive the summer and host live music and/or art stuff at night.",3
"I started with a $15 mojito at the bar. And then I elected the prix fixe dinner menu for $55. I regretted the latter decision. Although the starter two oysters were fresh, they were tiny, and I could tell from that that the rest of my meal would be unsatisfyingly small in portion. And indeed it was! My steak was probably only 6-8 oz. and was extremely dry and somewhat chewy and charred. But the sauce was good, though it didn't do enough to cover up the char. Lastly, the sorbet dessert was disappointing because the texture was that of dying-sorbet-making-machine-frozen-yogurt. \n\nBut.\nThe service was wonderful. Our waiter was extremely patient while we perused the menu, and even helped us out when we overheard us discussing how to obtain show tickets. He was sincere and kind, and frequently returned to our table to make sure everything was going well.\nAnd the beef carpaccio was amazing. I was extremely apprehensive about eating raw beef, but I worried to no avail. The beef was thinly sliced, spread atop a bed of cornbread and spring greens, and sprinkled with prosciutto. Just amazing.\nThe patio view is great, too. You can watch the fountain show while having dinner--how often do you get to do that?",2
"Really fresh, sizable salade ni\u00e7oise with delicious housemade champagne vinaigrette. (Exception: they use those canned black olives which are a tasteless abomination). Expedient friendly service, and prices perfect for frugal lunchers! I came in because of a Belly card deal and will be bookmarking this spot for future. The panini and sandwich options looked tasty, and I noticed they keep Mighty Leaf tea on hand, which is good quality stuff. A strip-mall gem!",4
"PLEASE READ, DO NOT EAT HERE!!!!!\n\nJust for the record, I have been working in the restaurant industry for several years from Michelin rated to casual. Therefore, I know good food, and bad food, when I see it.\n\nBattista's Hole in the Wall is the absolute worst restaurant I have ever been to. Listed below are all the reasons why:\n\n1. The Hostesses. All the hostesses were cold and unfriendly. Did not smile or welcome us. When asked to be seated they told us we had to have our whole party there (understandable for large parties) but we were a party of 4, 2 of us were there. When asked to see a menu, they handed us a paper menu with ZERO descriptions and when asked about the descriptions, they informed us that our server would inform us.\n\n1. The Server. When seated the was extremely clueless. He asked us several times if we had any questions, yet when we asked him questions he did not know. We asked him to explain the menu, and he pointed to the menu on the wall and told us to look at it. When asked what beers there were he told us all kinds, then only mentioned 2. He was very un attentive and took forever to do anything. \n\n3. According player. As you \""enjoy complimentary\"" soup/salad and bread, Gollum from The Lord of the Rings comes to your table and tells you (not asks) to play your party a song. Then, he awkwardly stands there until you reluctantly reach into your pocket/purse to give him a tip. \n\n4. The Food. The food was awful. The dishes are pre-made ($25+) meals which are extremely unappetizing. Literally, they tasted like TV dinners. We had Chicken Alfredo, Chicken Parmesan, and Beef Ravioli. Everyone hated they're dishes.\n\n5. Cover Charge. Considering I hated my meal, I returned it to the server assuming he would take it off the check. He did not. Only after requesting it's removal, the check is returned with a \""cover charge.\"" He did not tell us what this was and when asked, he informed us that \""when someone doesn't order a dish a cover charge is done to cover the \""included\"" soup/salad/bread. In my case since I sent my dish back, they decided to charge me $12 for their awful starters. \n \nFrom start to finish I had the absolute worst experience I have ever had at a restaurant and left hungry. Please do not waste your time/money on this place. I would give it no stars if I could. At this rate, Battista's will surely go out of business.",0
"We frequent the Los Tacos on W. Sahara on our lunchbreak.  The tacos come plain and there is an extra charge for the cheese, etc.  However, the prices are still reasonable.  I bit into my chicken taco yesterday and the meat was so moist it dripped juices.  It was not grease, but chicken broth.  The pico de gallo salsa is really good too. I love going here for lunch. My co-worker said her steak taco was awesome too.  The music was a little too loud for me though.",3
"This place was clean and well decorated.  I loved the couches in the waiting area. Every employee I encountered was helpful and in a great mood-even TSA!!\n\nMy connecting flight was in O'Hare in Chicago, I think I had such a negative experience at O'Hare that it made me love Dane County Regional Airport that much more!",4
Don't bother me. I'm in my happy place.,4
"I really enjoyed this place! It's hard to tell how intimate and sophisticated it is from the outside, but it really is lovely!\nThe food was great and the wait staff were knowledgable. The catered to me request that alcohol not be used in any of my dishes, and the food was delectable. \nThere was a live singer who really set the mood.\n\nImportant to note that i RARELY enjoy italian cuisine, and La Scala changed that.",3
"Purchased a fog machine and it was defective but lo and behold I can only do an exchange despite the fact it doesn't work! I don't want an exchange, I wanted a refund, but because it is too close to Halloween they won't help give me my money back.  Will certainly never bring my business back here!!!",0
"The cupcakes are decent but the kids working there have run me off for good. During my last visit the store was full of teenagers, friends of the kids working there. And while I'm paying $45 for a dozen cupcakes, the employees were handing out freebies to the other kids in the store without any regard for how rude they were being to their paying customers. I understand they have the right to give away anything they want to anyone they want, but they were more interested in impressing their friends than paying attention to the real customers.\n\nMy wife and I frequent the mall quite a bit and stop in regularly but I doubt we'll be back in anytime soon if we see the same kids working the store.",0
"We were staying at the MGM Grand and thought a nice dinner at Hooters would be a nice treat for our first night in Vegas. We'd been to Hooters elsewhere before and were looking forward to some yummy wings.\n\nThe server was super slow and after she finally took our order and we waited for much longer, instead of coming back with food she said we should order something else because their wings weren't defrosted yet... The menu VERY clearly said NEVER FROZEN so wtf. & other people were eating wings when we left so rabble rabble.",0
"I had high hopes for this place since I read the Yelp reviews first, but I am extremely unhappy with the service we received and I will not return. I am not a person who gets angry easily and I'm not a person to give low reviews very often either but this is ridiculous. \n\nI have a small little pound puppy who I've had for a little over a year. He's not actually a puppy, but a 10 year old dog who's appearance leads me to think he's had a rough life. When I adopted him I vowed to make his last years, better than his first. \n\nI took him to this hospital over my first choice because they could get me in sooner. We walked in and the place seemed ok at first. They went through the typical protocol of weighing him and asking the general questions about him, and the wait wasn't too terrible. \n\nOnce our vet came in, I told her all the problems my little guy has had, and she just didn't strike me as being very compassionate. He is extremely itchy and chewing off his fur, and she said it's most likely allergies. We told her that sometimes we have been itchy and so are the cats, and she said, \""That sounds like a personal problem.\"" \n\nOk first of all... I can't believe she would talk to a customer like that. I'm coming to her for her help not to be criticized. I just felt she treated us very poorly in general and I've already spent a couple thousand dollars at the vet in Ohio trying to figure out what's going on with him, still with no answers.\n\nShe decided to test him for allergies, which meant they'd draw his blood and send it off for outside allergens and food allergies. I was told I'd hear back in a week with the results. \n\nA week passes, and no call. I wait one more day and still no call, so finally I call them. They put me on hold and pass me around, and finally I'm disconnected. ARGH. So, I call them back and once again I'm passed around and put on hold forever and finally someone answers as if they didn't realize I was holding in the first place. I tell them I'm calling for my pup's results and it takes a minute to get them again. \n\nOnce she pulls them up he is apparently allergic to basically everything...grass, dust, certain trees etc. But, oops... they FORGOT to run the food panel!!! She informs me that I can bring him back in once again for more blood to be drawn so they can do the food panel, and then I can buy a serum that he has to be injected with weekly for 3 months to POSSIBLY help his allergies. \n\nSo let me get this straight, I'm supposed to buy this before you even run the food panel on him? My dog is itching to the point of pulling out his own fur and it could be that I'm simply feeding him something he's allergic to. Yes, he's still allergic to that other stuff but to inject him with something that may or may not work is crazy to me. Besides the point, that the first visit alone cost me over $500!!! The medicine is supposed to be $187 for a 3 month supply. They gave him a cortisone shot which I was pretty much against anyways because he'd already had one, and it didn't work! Well, lo and behold... this second one didn't work either. UGH.\n\nI know I'm not a vet, but I'm not stupid either. I know what works on my dog and what hasn't. I am just extremely frustrated, with a little guy who's had a tough run at life and I'm trying to improve his outlook while not spending my life savings on wrong answers and someone who talks down to me in the process. \n\nNo Thanks. I'll go to someone who actually cares about their customers and their owners.",0
This place is WONDERFUL!!!  The gelato is absolutely heavenly.  Their desserts are whimsical and tasty.  I would love to dive into the chocolate fountain.  The only bummer is that the place is too small.  They have a deli on one side and a desserterie on the other side.  They also have a few table that you have to crowd around.  They really need to enlarge the place in order to give the tables and lines the space they need.,3
"The place is very clean and well kept, service is always great and attentive.  I would not go anywhere else.",4
the Sandwich had too much mustard on it... place was empty and service was just okay.. no more kids eat free on wednesdays which was why i went there,1
"I just left my appointment without having all of my services completed!! I have been going to Joey for years and am shocked by what I just encountered. I had picked out a certain color and disliked it and she yells, \""I don't have time for this!\"" and says \""well what color do you want?\"" rudely!!\n\nAre you serious!!?? There was nobody waiting plus I had an appointment that you kept \nme waiting 20 minutes for.\n\nI have had it...There are plenty of places that will take my business.\n\nSo, I called Tyler, the owner, who has NO clue what is going on there. Nothing!! He says all he does is take the appointments, etc. I tried to explain the situation to him and got nowhere so I just hung up. \n\nI have given this place so many chances but it's not worth it. Good luck getting in on time when you make an appointment. That means nothing to them.",0
"Yum! There were four of us and we got the Ultimate Steak for 2, the Tomahawk Rib Eye, and 2 sides. Because the Ultimate Steak came with a side and there were wonderful warm and fluffy bread buns to eat, we were all stuffed when we left. The food came out promptly and was cooked perfectly to order. The staff was friendly. Everything was very tasty. The hashbrowns  were awesome, but got a little greasy/salty by the end. I liked the Rib Eye better than the Steak, but all was good. We spent more than I would normally, but for the amount and quality of food, and being in Vegas, it wasn't an outrageous bill.",3
"Always The Best! I've ordered pizza, wings, and subs from here before. Sauce is always so thick and tasty, wings are a blast of heaven in every bite, and the subs... cooked to perfection! These men and ladies here, really know what they're doing. My favorite pizza delivery place by far.",3
"Lame, no breakfast Sammie's. This joint is in the airport and I was happy to see it when I got off my plane because some breakfast sounded really good. No can do! Denied! This joint doesn't do breakfast sammiches. Wah. The cashier was super nice though, and wished us a very nice day, how chipper :)",2
"I'm so glad that a friend of mine chose this for our \""double date\"" night. I've driven past here several times, and never thought to try it. I wasn't crazy about the chips here, but LOVED the spicy pickled carrot slices that came atop them! My dish was fabulous. I ordered the Fajitas Cozumel, made with shrimp and tilapia, this dish is fresh and fabulous. Not to mention HUGE, I took home almost half! Next time, We'll definitely go back--hopefully on a day that it's not POURING rain(as it was when we went), because I'd love to sit outside! So nice.",3
"Where to start? The conveyor belt idea is definitely a plus and I miss sushi boats/conveyor belts from the east coast. The sushi selection is more on the limited side; however, I was pleasantly surprised of how fresh the yellowtail and the octopus was. The food was a good solid 3.5 stars. . . . so why barely 3 stars? \n\nSERVICE sucks! Perhaps I may have internalized resentment growing up in a Korean American community and experiencing various Korean owned and serviced restaurants, but damn these people had no shame. I made a reservation at 7:00 pm and they seemed to be clueless of my reservation. They repetitively asked my name and I answered as patiently as I could. Now the repetivive question was not due to a language barrier but I swear they seemed like they were hoping WE made the mistake. Even after we were seated, they continued to question what my name was and if my reservation was for a certain time. We felt like they were going to take away our seats even after being seated because of their persistent questioning with 2 different servers taking their turn interrogating us. Not to mention, the spilled soy sauce that we almost slipped on near our table. \n\nSo on average, I gave Teharu 3 stars. I am hoping for better service in my future visits. Good sushi, excellent price, but poor service.",2
"It's hard not to like this place since its so new and clean. From the moment you enter the lobby, sweet smelling oxygen greets you. The check-in/-out process is much more painful than it was on my first visit two years ago, but clearly they are busier than when they first opened. There is a nice selection of places to eat and shop, with a very high-end mall attached. The pool area is incredible. Even the conference rooms are very nice. Rooms are spacious with large shower and bath plus a separate toilet enclosure. The high-tech features of the lighting on the TV is a nice touch. I will always try to stay here when in Vegas.",4
"Everything that is wrong with chain restaurants. First clue: robotically cheerful drones wearing baseball hats and headsets to greet you. Next: table buried under menus, special offer flyers, rewards card app, etc.  Then: food choices. I have nothing against red meat. Love burgers. But if you want to know why America has become the most obese country look no further. Unlimited fries with every sandwich? Really?  Bottomless rootbeer float. Oink oink. There is enough sodium in this food to melt the January ice on Lake Monona.",0
"I am a huge fan of Mexican food and would eat it everyday if I could. Sabor did not disappoint!\n\nI ordered the Arepas which was delicious and full of flavorful chicken. I've never had anything like it before - there was almost a sweetness to it. Definitely a must try! I also had an empanada because I love them at Three Amigos, and this one was just as yummy (dare I say even tastier?). It was full of cheesy chicken and cooked to perfection - aways a favorite. The boyfriend ordered two of the tacos authenticos with steak and he liked em! Monday-Friday they have the tacos for 99 cents from 3p-5p which is a pretty awesome deal.  We also ordered the chips and guacamole which were really good, but we had way too much food and will probably do without those next time.\n\nBeer selection is good but definitely over priced. Example, the Recreationale was $3 something and up the street at the corner store, its $1 something.  We went for coronas.  \n\nI'm a fan and will be back to Sabor!",3
"Crackers and Co is pretty fantastic. My husband loves the Meat Lover's Omelet, and I always get the California Eggs Benny- yum! The coffee is tasty, and the servers are fast and friendly. \nI usually enjoy their potatoes that come on the side, but on a few occasions they have been a bit mushy and undercooked for my taste.This location tends to be a bit busier than their other ones, but even when there is a wait, it's usually not too long.\nI'm going to keep coming back here, it's one of my favorite breakfast spots.",3
"Five stars for amazing service, gorgeous room and the money I got and won here (: \n\nOur room was huge on the 45th floor. Nice sitting area, table and chairs, kind bed and entertainment area. Huge floor to ceiling windows acted as the most perfect end cap. Clean and modern just the way great hotel rooms are. \n\nThe huge marble bathroom and jacuzzi tub were fabulous. So comfortable, soft towels, great robes. \n\nEveryone who we interacted with from the housekeeping to the casino staff were fun and nice. (: it was a fun night",4
"1. Food was mediocre-Overpriced for what it's worth. \n\n2. Service was atrocious -items we ordered did not come, the server was not in the dining room when we wanted tea/the bill\n\n3. Dangerous floors? lol 2 people fell during the time we had dinner\n\n4. Menu is not up to date - it doesn't say that ice cream is just for dinner but apparently it is\n\n5. Waitresses/Waiters cannot communicate properly in English or French and are very slow to attend to our needs\n\n7. Plates to eat with were not given to us until we had to ask.\n\n8. The waitress was erasing past selections on the all-you-can-eat menu from past customers on our table before we could select our items. Unprofessional... and ghetto..\n\nOVERALL: \n\nDon't waste your time or money. \nYou can find sushi which is better/equivalent with faster service elsewhere.",0
"Bad food - bad service. The chicken salad sandwich made the roof of my mouth hurt because the bread was so hard and dry.  I had to repeat myself numerous times before they got my order \""right@, then it still came out wrong.",0
"I think my family and I got lung cancer 2 minutes after walking in the doors. You pay a hefty resort fee per day and the pools close at 7pm... Pissed my kids right off. The remote in our room didn't work. There is NO fridge, which pissed ME right off. We stayed in the Paradise Tower, corner King room. Room was nice and didn't smell of smoke. I wouldn't stay here again",2
"This is a great show to catch if you're in Vegas and not up to watching one of the seemingly millions of  cirque du soleil shows.  It's shorter than the broadway version (only 90 minutes long and no intermission) so make sure that you know the storyline before the show, otherwise you will be LOST.  There isn't a bad seat in the house since the theater was built specifically for Phantom and honestly, the worse seats are probably in the front because you'll have to turn around to see all of the chandelier action.",3
"Ok, I've been a big Richardson's fan since back in the day and love the Rokerij as well. I've been going there since literally before it opened (the dry run) and have always had good food and service that ranges from acceptable to great with one notable exception. On that occasion I called and complained just to make the manger aware and she made it right and made it impossible to complain any further. This is an insider place that I tell and take out of town business guests to as well. Although I liked it more before the remodel when it was a bit more formal and different from Richardson's. Now the menus are much more similar but Rokerij has tapas items, I think they call small plates almost all of which are awesome, especially the Brie Toasts with Steak. I remember when they first changed the menu we went in and someone said, \""Wait a minute, this is the same as the damn Richardson's menu\"", we looked at each other and said, \""Sweet\"" and enjoyed our meals anyway. My cork-dork friends like the wine list and I like the cocktails. The atmosphere is nice but casual, dark wood, big booths, fireplace and etc. they have a decent bar downstairs (and one upstairs as well) where you can also eat if you want to sit in a line at the bar (also three booths and another fireplace with couch and club chairs) but it makes me a bit claustrophobic to be locked in there. Parking is easy with the new lot they added and the place is busy most nights of the week so if you are going with a group call ahead.",3
"As a group of scattered friends we have been meeting once a year around the holidays for dinner. For the past 30 plus years we have always eaten at Don and Charlie's. Last year we finally realized that they were just not up to par anymore. We took a chance and tried Houston's. Typical Scottsdale eatery. Range Rovers, posers and people not at all concerned with paying WAY too much for average food. Hamburger, pork chop, kale salad and ribs. It was just ok. Have had better for much, much less money. First go around with the pork chop plate, the potatoes were cold. Got a replacement and they tried to charge for them. No pre-dinner anything. We asked for bread and they brought a \""bread service\"" which is 4 slices of rosemary bread. $1 on the bill. Really? The ribs were pretty good but at $28 they should have been. Have had much better for a little more than half of that. The staff was attentive and very friendly, no problem there. Needless to say, we will be shopping around again next year.",1
"is it possible to hate a place you've never even been to? Why yes! I think it is. Thank you, Grandview, for nearly ruining my trip to Vegas and sticking me in the filthiest room of all time. \n\nAbout a year ago, my boyfriend and I were staying at Mandalay and passing through Luxor on our way back. We were lured in by some slick talking sales man, asking us if we wanted a free stay in Vegas. A few cocktails deep, he had our attention. He told us that if we pay 99$ deposit now, come back within 18 months and participate in a time share tour, we would have the $99 refunded and essentially have a free trip to vegas. HOWEVER, he made it clear, that most people are not interested in the timeshare tour and they are really doing it to bring people back to Vegas since the economy is so shitty -thus, the timeshare tour was not mandatory. I would lose the $99 on the deposit, but $99 for a weekend stay in Vegas is pretty much the best deal out there. We decided to go for it since we frequent Vegas. \n\nFast forward to this past weekend. Our friends were getting married in Vegas and we decided it was the perfect opportunity to cash in on our sweet little deal. We had the option of staying at either Luxor or Excalibur. Neither is great, but for $99 I could really care less, so we chose Luxor. When we arrived, the guy at the Grandview who was responsible for checking us in first was beyond rude. He basically told us the timeshare tour was absolutely mandatory and that if we failed to show up, not only would we lose the $99, but we'd also pay top dollar for our room. I later found out rates for the that weekend would have cost me nearly $700- read my review about Luxor- absolutely not worth it. I thankfully still had all the paperwork from the prior year and no where on anything I signed did it say anything about the tour being mandatory or that I'd have to pay in full. We were sitting there for a good 10 minutes trying to figure it out but the guy was not budging at all and so completely rude to us that we finally agreed to go on a timeshare tour. He said it would be between 2-4 hours long. We were there for a wedding and didn't have that amount of time on either day to devote to that. Plus, after reading other reviews, it seems it was more in the ballpark of 4-5 hours- thank god we didn't go for it because we would have missed the rehersal dinner and wedding!\n\nAfter he checked us in, we still had to go over to Luxor to get our room- yet another inconvenience of this whole debacle. It wasn't until we got to Luxor and spoke with a manager that he told us that the guy at Grandview was full of shit and that he was not allowed to charge us the full rate. Because we booked through Grandview, they stuck us with the shittiest room ever (and I mean that!) and we couldn't upgrade, even if we paid. It took so much deliberating with a hotel staff member the next night to get them to switch our room, which was completely disgusting and unlivable. Grandview made our trip to Vegas so much more stressful than it needed to be. If you see them in Luxor, RUN!!!!!",0
"Luxury theater pretty much says it all.   It's expensive, but comfortable.  Check out Salt bar for a drink before or after the show. Although tough to have a couple drinks and then watch a movie without falling asleep, but at least you can take the drinks into the theater.  Assigned seats is nice, but you have to buy tickets early to get good seats which takes some planning.  We sat in the 2nd row, which was way too close for comfort.   Not an everyday type of theater, but worth a visit for the novelty alone.",3
"This place is great if you are looking to wash your dog by yourself. They layout for self-wash is good. The reason I am giving this place 1 star is because of my horrible experience with the groomer named Michelle. I called to inquire about grooming and was told that it includes a wash, nail trim, ear cleaning and haircut. I made my appointment 2 weeks in advance.\n\nWhen it was time for my appointment, I dropped my dog off and the groomer was not friendly at all. She just told me to lock my dog up in their cage. She didn't even take a second to ask me anything or talk to me since she was busy working with another dog. I left and waited, it took her 6 hours to call me back to pick my dog up. \n\nI had my friend pick up my dog since I couldn't. She paid the grooming fee plus tip. Once I saw my dog, it came to my surprise that his hair wasn't cut, nails weren't trimmed, and his left ear was super red. I called the groomer to voice my concern and instead of making it right with me, she made an excuse saying and I quote \""you should have clarified and said what you wanted done with your dog\"". I then said I didn't have a chance since she made it so hard to talk to her and I did mention what I wanted when I made the appointment (plus I shouldn't have to, I was informed that the grooming package included nail trim and hair cut so that's what I expected) and her response was, again I quote \""I don't remember every appointment I book!\"" how unprofessional!! Maybe you should write it down or at least be friendly enough to talk to your customers!\n\nTo make matters worse, my dog got an ear infection in his left ear which cost me $60.00 to treat. It was difficult trying to put the ear drops on my dog. After the 10 day treatment, the experience left my dog scared to be touched on his head and by his ears.\n\nIf you don't want to go through hell, DO NOT go here for grooming! You'll waste your money, be misinformed, not get the service you want, give trauma to your dog and be treated unprofessionally.",0
"Just Celebrated my Sisters Birthday here, and we all had a Fabulous time !  they had a Great Band!  the food we had was greasy and good !  the Smores were the best, not too many Restaurants offer Smores, also it was a thursday night that we went, and they had a free Dance Lesson, which was so much fun, would difinitely recommend this place for a FUN time !",4
"Looking Glass Books, where have you been all my life.\n\nIndulge me for a minute here. I must give a bit of background for this review to have context. I'm an English Literature graduate. I'm a book worm, and have been since I was a wee girl. I had one of those clip-on book lamps and would keep myself awake for hours, well past my bed time, addicted to the novel I was reading at the time. I wanted to be The Little Princess. I went through a horror phase (Stephen King) but ultimately my heart lies with Victorian novels, and turn-of-the 20th century American literature and poetry. I used to spend an hour browsing Waterstones in my home town to come away with one new hallowed novel, from my pocket money.  I also have a fetish for stationary, and used to collect notebooks (not daring to write in them). I love books. I love literature. I love pretty things. Oh and it goes without saying I love tea and cake.\n\nAnd then, there was Looking Glass Books. Tucked behind the Starbucks on Quartermile, it's quite hidden and I don't think you'd know it were here if you were not passing down that passageway that takes you to the Pure Gym.\n\nBut tucked away you'll find a glass-encased bibliophiles dream. The store is quite small but perfectly formed. It's decorated in the most wonderful way - simple, yet sumptuous. All clean glass and bizarrely minimalist (is this ever possible in a room full of bookcases and books?) but with rich colours, from turquoise to hot pink. And it's a caf\u00e9-come-book shop so there's a mix of chairs and sofas, with a counter displaying the cakes, with bookcases blending as if it were the most natural thing in the world.\n\nThe books. Oh the books. Proudly displayed at the end of one aisle are the most exquisite copies of some classics -Pride and Prejudice, Wuthering Heights. Now I know you shouldn't judge a book by its cover, but it can't be wrong when they look so very pretty. These are collector's books, the sort of books you'd leave on your bed side table - not stuffed into your handbag to read on a quick bus commute. \n\nThe range of books is wonderful too. I spent a good 20 minutes here browsing, from Classics to modern fiction, poetry to topical and psychology books. Not text books, but interesting reads. I feel if I were ever in need of inspiration, a browse of Looking Glass Books shelves would provide me with ample brain fodder.\n\nThis really is my ideal shop. The only reason it's lacking a star is, as a caf\u00e9, it doesn't have any savoury food and this makes me a bit sad. I do love cake but I would happily spend hours here working with the free wifi, reading beautiful novels, and I can't live solely on cake. It's a small detail, but it counts.\n\nBut if I'm ever feeling blue or bored or needing inspiration, I know if I head to Looking Glass Books I'll be right as rain.",3
"Just moved from California to Arizona 7 months ago and it's been difficult to find a good Barbershop (especially one that the barbers actually listen to what you want) until my curiosity brought me to Senior's Barbershop. I've been getting my haircut there every thursday with Mariana and shes really good with skin mid fades (i literallly walk out there with my head feeling like a baby's bottom) Derek, Yolanda and Mariana are all very good barbers, they take credit and cash, and always have the latest news on. Check out this place, you'll love it.",4
"02/21/11\n\nCame here after reading Linda W.'s delightful review.  Had the green tea, gyoza (potstickers), beef and pork egg noodle combo, and a strawberry boba shake.  The gyoza app was good, though the six pieces were too small to share, BUT they were definitely MUCH better than those I'd found at China Magic Noodle House!  The noodle dish was good... preferred the BBQ pork over the beef pieces, but the leftovers weren't as good-- I threw them out after the first bite.  The homemade boba shake was a very nice surprise... creamy and a bit too sweet for me, so I stopped after about a third of it.  Many of the boba (tapioca rounds) were too big to pass through the straw, and that straw was HUGE, as straws go, and that was another reason for me to quit trying.  What I didn't like was finding a bit of plastic in my mouth after taking a big slurp-- the shake was made on site, then mechanically topped w/ a plastic wrap cover that had to be broken w/ a straw in order to drink out of the cup- blech!  Having written all that, I'd order another shake in the future, and I'll be sure to share it w/ a friend, or two!",2
Tried this place the other night - Top notch service.\n\nThe Pasta was excellent. I had the veal marsala and it was a tad over cooked but still quite tasty. Also had the a pair of cannolis and they were fresh and very good.\n\nThe value is the real story here. Awesome Service at a price that makes it easy to frequent without feeling guilty.\n\nI'm a fan.,3
"Before I got into detail about Eclipse's wonderful job on my 350z, I first want to talk about my previous experience not even 2 weeks ago.\n\nI first started this long journey online looking at different tint brands and the best quality I could find. Looking online everyone was saying that the 3M product gave the darkest black that you could get. Because my car is white I decided that I would want a tint film like that. I used to work at a tint shop myself quite a while ago as a car runner and I know how important the tint was, but also the installer. So I started looking.\n\nLooking around on Yelp, since it has been a great place to find good shops, I found a dealer that does 3M tinting. I will not name the company since the issue was resolved, but I found them on Yelp and ask them about tinting my car. I was pretty clear about the limo tint around the car, as my lancer has that exact limo tint on it as well. After the install, I confirmed with the lady at the desk that it was infact limo even though it seemed a bit light. After not being able to get over the fact that it didn't seem dark enough, I looked at the receipt and sure enough it said that the front windows were 35% and the back was the limo at 5%. It was very disheartening that 5 star tint shop on Yelp let me down in this way, so I cautiously looked for someone else to tint my car, again.\n\nLuckily, this is where I found Eclipse and a couple other high ranking tint shops. All the reviews were fantastic and after sending a message to a couple companies, I really liked the clarity that Eclipse replied with. I did think it was a bit strange that they didn't have a way for me to message them on Yelp but that was okay. So I went to their site to read more about them and I saw there was a option to talk to someone via chat from the site. I know it doesn't seem like a big deal, but I wanted to go over the details that I got via email on what I wanted to do. I talked to Lee Anne Migray who manages the office and she was absolutely outstanding to talk to. She answered all my questions that I had and was able to make an appointment. Not only that but I had a couple set backs that forced me to need to reschedule, I called in and she remembered talking to me and what my car was which is crazy! She happily changed my installation date and also confirmed the day before to make sure I remembered.\n\nThe install was completely fantastic. After talking to Eclipse I decided to do 5% all the way around like I wanted in the first place with the previous company, and I also decided to get the whole windshield tinted 80% to help with UV rays, as well as a windshield strip at the top mostly for looks. Eric was right in the window that I was told he would be in. Not only that but Eric clarified what tint percentage and what was being done to the car to make sure there were no mistakes. He took my keys and was ready to go. I asked him how long it would take and he told me about two hours and he was right on.\n\nThe car is a night and day difference with the tint. Me and Eric both talked about how different the car looked and also talked about my previous experience. Believe it or not Eric used to work in the same tint shop as my previous companies owner, but how different both of them are. Not only that but Eric was even able to take cards! I felt bad that I didn't have cash on me but Eric assured me it wasn't a issue.\n\nA huge thank you to the Eclipse Window Tinting team, you really came through where the other company couldn't. Also being mobile saved me a huge hassle!",4
Love the mussels and the dessert are phenomenal. Be prepared to wait though if you have more than 2 or 3 people because the restaurant has limited seating but it is well worth the wait. Have gone two times in the last month and want to go again.,4
typical froyo place- their fruit flavors are better than a lot of places i've gone to. tuesdays is double punch day and that's always a plus,2
"Never even heard of this place, but apparently this is a popular joint for airport employees and Air Force workers across the street. It's another hole in the wall burger/sandwich place (I love them!). It looks a little dumpy on the outside, which never scares me off. The inside was just as bad looking, can we say tacky all the way? What they lack in decor, however, they make it up with low prices and big portion of food. My gyro was $4.75 and came with a side. It was good too, the slices of gyro was still warm, stuffed in a soft warm pita with plenty of lettuce, tomato & onion and tzatziki sauce. The tzatziki sauce was a good compliment to the sandwich instead of being a distraction (sometimes they are too tart or garlicky or herby). The onion rings were the typical frozen corn meal ones, so I say stick with fries instead... why can't I be pleasantly surprised with beer batter ones?!  \n\nAll in all, this is a great cheap place to eat near the airport even for a non airport area employee like myself.",3
"The food is  decent.  I had a bad experience with the woman at the register and she was totally rude!!!  I called and spoke to the owner, but he didn't seem to care....so I didn't care to go back to the business.  I would rather spend my money at a place that values it's customers.  Hey, we are the ones keeping them in business after all.",1
"We ordered on-line which of course was super easy.  We ordered two different pasta bowls.  The food arrived sooner than predicted, was very hot.  The delivery person was presentable, personable, and efficient.  This is the very best experience we have ever had from this Domino's location.",4
I would rather pay double than go to this walmart again. Don't go... Just don't go. Horrible place. Where to begin? First of the month is a circus of rude people and crowded slammed with food stamps. It was 5PM and there was 2 isles open for 150 people. If you want to know what is wrong with America go to this walmart. You will see first hand. Don't try and check out either. Rude person after rude person. The door guy is nice at least. Besides that door guy... Yea I'm willing to pay double to never return.,0
"My latest visit to Lotus of Siam was again a success!  Almost every time I come here, someone I am with wants to order something that I know will not be good.  I usually just smile and say, \""Sure, let's try it\"".  I don't want to force my friends to order only what i like, which is why I nod my head and smile, but these dishes remind me each time of why it is so important to order correctly here.  The bad dish this time was the fried dumplings.  Very bland, stuffed with a very small amount of meat, and very average.  \n\nLuckily, they served the Beef Jerky and the dumplings at the same time, so my friend was able to see why i like this place so much.  We got the Beef Jerky, Northern Style Pork Curry, Issan Sausage, Seafood with Drunken Noodle, and Coconut Ice Cream w/ Fried Banana Roll.  Everything was very good.  The sausage was very dry, but had a great fermented flavor, and when combined with the cabbage, fresh chiles, roasted peanuts, ginger, and cilantro, it covers the palate with different flavors that work together perfectly.  \n\nThe coconut ice cream was worth writing home about too!  Icy, refreshing, and full of fresh coconut flavor, this was the best way to end the meal since the Sticky rice w/ mango was not available as the mangoes were not in season.  \n\nOnce again, Lotus of Siam comes through!",4
"I went to go to Subway and Lobby's was next door and I always like to try out new places and support a small business whenever I can. \nThe Bacon Chesse Burger was excellent and the fries were hot and crispy without me having to ask, which is really unusual. \nThe price was a little on the high side, but the food was really good and I wish them all the best.",4
"Our favorite restaurant in Vegas! The food is phenomenal, the service is excellent! There is often an hour wait for a table but it is definitely worth it.",4
"The service sucked, went on a Sunday night it took forever to get seated in a Vegas restaurant ON A SUNDAY!!! It was horrible.\n\nAnd our server was so un attentive, she would only come by twice the whole time we were there. And she kept saying that our milkshakes were in the way, but me and my family noticed that people who arrived after us were already getting their milk shakes and we were still waiting for ours to come.\n\nThen when our food arrived the burgers and fries were EXCELLENT, but our shakes still have yet to arrive.... So after we finished our burgers and fries the waitress gives us our check but we still did not have our milk shakes. And when we finally get them the shakes were horrible, it was gooey and frozen not like any other milk shake I have ever tried... Basically the shakes and service is why I am only giving 1 star....\n\nI will not be coming back, people just go to in n out its cheaper and the burgers and shakes are amazing, and the service is way better",0
"Just cause a place has been there awhile and it is always crowded, doesn't mean its good and that is the story at Harlows. Alot of people really don't know any better and stay in their routine. Two belgian waffles were ordered and neither of us could make it through more than a few bites of this overdense waffle with no flavor. These waffles are in no way comparable to Matt's - they are doing something very wrong here.\n   Moving onto the biscuits, well I'm not sure what recipe they use for biscuits, but they in no way resemble any kind of real Southern flaky quality. Two biscuits cost about 4 bucks, but they taste like biscuit cake. Refills of coffee were excellent and there was no line at 9am midweek which was a plus. Don't believe the hype here - go to Matt's.",0
"Read alot of bad reviews on this place...\nGot to admit the 1st time I went it was NOT my fave.  \nHowever i decided to give it a second chance so a few days ago when a friend wanted to take me to dinner - we picked Carrabbas . \nWe were seated quickly -nice \nThe waiter was quick and cool. double nice.\nThen we ordered ... 1st a lovely Pinot Grigio which was both light and sweet to the taste. \nWe ordered the Caprese Skewers. Which came served with pesto, I was a little nervous but dug in. Was delighted that it was delish. I think I could have sat and ate tomatoes and cheese and pasta all night. \nHowever my salad with house dressing came next. The dressing was light and not over powering. \nAlso could have made a lovely dinner out of just salad. Yet here came the chicken parmesan. \nHe got Ravioli with potato chicken and spinach in it.\nyum yum yum yum yummy!!!!\nEverything was VERY good. \nIf you don't want chain food... go where is best for you. \nI preferred this to Olive Garden or Macaroni Grill. \nBut that is just me.",3
"My friends and I love this place, we've been making a habit to try to come at least once a month.",3
Excellent hand crafted burgers.   Pretzel sticks were fantastic along with the beer mustard.   Homemade ketchup is a nice touch instead of the regular corn syrup type.  Arizona burger on pretzel bun with handcut bacon was awesome.    The Belgian wheat beer was very good.   Highly recommend.,3
"We came on a Saturday for lunch. The server was very friendly. Portions are very big, so consider sharing if you've got a small appetite. The ambiance is like a sports bar, TVs everywhere and comfy seating.",3
"So this place HAD been in the running for a wedding rehearsal dinner... not anymore. \n\nWhen the fiance and I arrived, we were seated right away by a girl who was dancing and speaking with coworkers as she walked us to our table. Ok, no biggie. She's just quirky. Our server could have been a football player himself and was nice enough. Fiance ordered a steak and I ordered the brioche-crusted salmon. Since we were looking for rehearsal dinner places, we figured we should get grown-up food and not burgers or sandwiches, and quite honestly that may have been our mistake.\n\nThe steak was alright... it's hard to make a steak bad in my book. It definitely was not cooked medium well as he had asked for. I'm a medium rare steak person and it was right on the cusp of being too undone for even me. It had an odd taste to it that wasn't bad, but wasn't necessarily good either.\n\nAs for the salmon... well... I probably won't come here again based off of it. The description said that it was brioche-crusted and I believe it also said there was some sort of pesto on it also. The waiter explained when I was ordering that the ratatouille that came with it had a red sauce. I didn't realize that the salmon would also have it. I ALSO didn't realize that the \""red sauce\"" was tomato sauce. On salmon. Without any sort of pasta or starch. I had asked for mashed potatoes based on the fact that I didn't want red sauce veggies, and in my mind this would a been the cue for our server to inform me that the salmon also had it. Mind you there was nothing listed on the menu about it having tomato sauce. The fish itself was overcooked also which made it impossible to eat without the sauce giving it some sort of moisture.\n\n\nNow I would only read this if you are wedding planning, as it is more of a rant, and won't necessarily be helpful for everyone:\nMy fiance recommended this place to me as being somewhere that was \""Pittsburgh\"" for our rehearsal since my family and friends are from out of town. We loved the idea of being right on the river and the patio outside, and it's really the best option to chose from being the other ones are Tilted Kilt (nope) and McFaddens (love it, but it is LOUD!) So I decided to use the website and requested info regarding events as they had that option listed. Nothing. Emailed again, still nothing. Since this was a place that fiance really seemed to have his mind set on, I called. The girl that I spoke with was very helpful while on the phone. She stated that she would email me that day with event menu samples and she would research the date to see if there were any Pirates games or concerts she could find yet. This was 3 weeks ago and I still have not heard back from her. I've given up. Even though the location would be perfect, I would be terrified until the day-of that they would forget our group of 26 was coming in.",1
"Service was, as stated elsewhere, a little slow. We ended up here after the buffet was closed, and waited maybe 15 minutes to be seated. We went with the three course dinner for 40, and it was great! The iceberg salad was typical. I got the filet mignon, and it was fantastic. I got it with macaroni and cheese, and sauteed mushrooms as sides. They were also both fantastic. For dessert, cheesecake. It was good. My boyfriend got the French onion soup (he really liked it), the mixed grill (was amazing) with macaroni and potatoes (he also loved them), and chocolate cake (good). Overall, the entree was definitely the best part of the meal, but it was solid overall.",3
"Seriously? The person that runs this place is genius. I must find a way to copy your entire idea and move it to a beach for myself. I thought I walked into my own dream when I came in here. I haven't been to Lux in about 1.5 years and since then it has moved into the building next to the old one, tripled in size and is the most delicious, eclectic coffee experience I could ask for. Looking for fresh hand roasted coffee on site, check! Fresh made unique pastries, check! Fresh, gourmet-like food, check! Handmade from fresh (and I mean FRESH squeezed juice) mimosas, check! I can go on....I could not ask for a better place to be a part of my life. Thank you heaven for waiting for me to find you.",4
Just got my shrimp jammers at Tommy Rocker's. They are delicious! Great place for lunch.,3
"Don't get it. Ordered their \""famous\"" Grandma...not impressed. Very chewy dry dough and crust. No flakiness at all. And while the sauce has some peppery zing- it was extremely acidic as well. Service great, but all told 2 stars.",1
"I was so excited to hear that PJ opened next to my work!  I love how trendy the decor is and the food is even better!  I could eat that grilled chicken and hummus everyday if I could!  Last time I tried the Grilled Veggie salad, it was a large portion and delish!",4
"I'm not an avid sushi eater, sushi is sushi to me and sushi everywhere seems over priced for what it is. \n\nThis sushi seemed good and fresh to me, they lost stars due to horrendous and irritating service. \n\nCoke products are a big plus, tho they are served in Pepsi cups? \n\nI would come back without a doubt, but again, I eat sushi maybe twice a year.",1
"We were excited about having Thai food for dinner tonight and decided to try some place new instead of our usual favorite place. Based upon the reviews, we had high expectations. We were sorely disappointed. We got phad thai, cashew chicken, and panang curry. Every single dish was flat and flavorless. We are incredibly disappointed that we spent $33 plus tax and had to force ourselves to eat it just to not waste the money (yes, it was that bad).",0
"Disappointing - high energy equals lousy ambiance for a quiet romantic dinner. Odd tables (table for two much longer than usual - 4 ft from your table mate). Food was fair - very expensive and therefore marginal value. Tried it once, will not be back",1
"Been a member for a few months now, been bitter sweet. Their classes and programs are world class, no complaints. Gym and workout facilities are top notch too. What is a big let down in a facility this caliber is recreational area and cleanliness. The sauna and steam room are always dirty and smelly, sauna room is falling apart, can't get myself to step into the jacuzzi for this reason, it almost feels like a different facility back there, just kills your post workout relaxation experience. Mensroom shower area and supplies are sketchy too. Guess this level could be the normal somewhere else but CAC is meant to be a 5 star gym experience, and parts of it are certainly not! And they don't honor the yelp offer if you ask them for it small thing but big customer service deductions. Hope they see this and fix it!!",2
Another awesome visit without friends at Taxco. Chicken Quesadilla with a side of rice. Shredded chicken with a scoop of white cheese sauce.,4
"I have an update and it is not a good one.  My mom was visiting from out of town and needed to get her nails filled.  From the moment she walked in the woman \""assigned\"" to her was rude and very hard to deal with.  Considering this place must rely on a significant amount of walk-in business, this is very disappointing.  She was actually told to \""stop talking, I am doing this my way\"" by the person doing her nails!  My mom has been getting her nails done for over 30 years so needless to say this wasn't her first rodeo.  Looks like I will be looking for a new place to get my pedicures.",0
"I went back today after originally rating a 4 for good food, reasonable prices an fast service. My first trip I hadn't eaten all day and stopped on my way back at about 5pm and was served my first order within minutes and was done with the meal in probably 20 minutes.  (I like small plates so i only ordered 2 things)\n\nToday's experience was the same in terms of food and service.  I sat at the sushi bar, was promptly handed a little tray of ginger and wasabi and my order was taken as fast as I could decide and ready in about three minutes.  All good and I especially like they don't overload the sushi with rice. (eel was particularly delicious!)  \n\nHere's the problem... when the check came I looked at the bill and way below everything I actually ordered which was written neatly on the top was a $5 charge for the ginger and wasabi... hidden neatly under the pocket that held the bill.\n\nI can describe this in one word \""Cheesy\""\n\nThis is the kind of thing that will stop me from coming back.\nI",1
"I looooooooove thier pho!!!\nthis place is always swinging.  I don't think I have every stopped by without nearly every table being full.  \nAnd for good reason, that pho!  Everything looks great, and smells wonderful, but I tend to stick to this awesome soup and spring rolls or a banh mi!  \nThe parking can be a bit of  a hassle, this could actually be the worst parking lot in Phoenix, but it is worth it.\nAnd you know what they always get my togo order right, which is a nice plus.",4
"Have stayed here a number of times for weddings, business and pleasure. The hotel is made up entirely of suites, and the base grade of suites is already very plush. Each has its own little living room and the sleeping areas are very divided from the main parts of the suite.\r\n\r\nCORPORATE NEEDS: The extensive business offerings also come very much in handy, especially in the mid-grade suites and above...The Venetian staff became a true extension of my team's effort.\r\n\r\nFAMILY / SOCIAL: Very accommodating of families as well as family / social functions. Lovely facilities and isolated ground areas for weddings and the likes. Depending on the suite level, there are all kinds of extras such as video libraries to keep all age levels entertained.\r\n\r\nEMAIL SPECIALS -- make sure to get on their email newsletter list. The specials are amazing!",4
it was a wed. so def. picked the wrong night to attempt to party at this spot it seems. \n\nit was TECHNO night. EWWWWWWWWWWWWWWW \n\nwe walk in no prob- get escorted immediately by the door guy to the VIP area without even asking and set up with free drinks from some random guys table which is a bonus at least we can try and get drunk and poss. make the music sound better. \nNOPE. \n\ndance floor was packed anyway with old washed up ravers and e-tards rubbin on each other. gross. \nVIP area is elevated which is nice to people watch and not get bothered by most patrons. EXCEPT the fact that its only like 2 stairs up so if your leaning against the rail or dancing too close to the edge by the dance floor BEWARE the GRABBY HANDS!!!!throught the bars and everything i mean sheeesh. \n\nasked the waitress if there was another room- yea in the corner [ never found it- never looked for it but couldn't see any type of other room/ entrance anywhere in plain sight] but she warned us it was trance music playing in there. \n\nthe most annoying thing besides the people and the music and the grabby hands was the super intense fog machine they had blast smelly white clouds all over everyone every 5 minutes. making you cough and freak out a little since you can't see your own hand in front of your face til it clears. \n\nPLUSSSSSSSSSSSs its off the strip. \n\nso I'm giving it 2 stars instead of 1 on the chance we were there on an off night. \n\nwe left literally 20min after arriving even with free VIP table and bottle service.,1
Very nice casino but the hotel is overpriced.,2
The menu has many great diverse options. I was very impressed by the service here for the waiters were friendly and helpful. The cinnamon bun was absolutely outstanding!,3
I'm not a carnivore who likes to eat in mass quantities btw but this place isn't half bad. I ordered the sausage plate and picked from my man's beef brisket -- good stuff. We finished the plate with no problems. The small plate was perfect . . . scared to see what the large is. The collard greens were not bad either. The little tater tott things were tastey.,2
I enjoyed this sports bar while watching the Tarheel game Saturday.  There are plenty of screens and plenty of seating.  Karoke shortly followed the games.  I hear there is jazz at some locations.  This place served its purpose.  I cannot complain about anything besides the slooooow service we received.  It took 25 mins for one app to come out.  The server was new and awkward as well.,2
"This is hands down the coolest concert venue you can experience in Phoenix. They have great artists, a great sound system, a great layout, great food, great djs on the weekends... it's just the best! Definitely worth checking out with a group of friends.\n\nThere's only two things I dislike about this place A. The view of a parking garage when sitting on the patios, and B. the fact that they coral the under 21 crowd during shows. It often means my group gets split up. I know plenty of venues that don't corner off the under 21 crowd, so idk why crescent does.\n\nBut those are minor complaints. This place is awesome!",4
"Pros: Awesome presentations, large portions and a unique concept.\n\nCons: Service is usually sluggish and the presentation outperforms the taste of the dishes.",2
"I had the best possible experience a person can have at a Dentist office. Easily 5 stars...\n\nMy last visit to a dentist office was just plain awful and scary. So I was a bit anxious and apprehensive, but I ended up leaving with a smile on my face. The staff here are top notch professionals. They are friendly and thoughtful and made me feel completely comfortable. Jan took me back to an exam room and had me laughing and feeling right at ease. Which is pretty important in a typically unpleasant place (who likes getting their mouth poked?). She was just a wonderful and nice woman.\n\nThen in comes Dr. Howard Farran, who had me rolling right from the get go. So funny and super knowledgeable! He seemed to take a genuine interest in my visit and made me feel like I came to the right place. I actually learned quite a bit just from talking with him. He explained all my options and his recommendations. No pressure or up-selling. Great guy. Great Doctor.\n\nI'll be back in a couple weeks... and dare I say I'm actually looking forward to my next visit.",4
"Wish this charming little restaurant was here when we lived a bit closer to this neighborhood! Still, it was a fun discovery one day when we were on our way to the PV Mall.  The food and service were good. The server even took the time to give us the restaurant's backstory. We have gone back for take-out empanadas, both savory and dessert. They make a fine quick mid-week meal.",3
"I have been a loyal customer at Polished since it opened a few years back. When it only had one room and a small friendly staff. It was difficult to get an appointment but I called in advance because I was so happy with their services I would wait a week to get my nails done. I would normally get gels and I was very happy with the selection of colors. I was always treated well and offered coffee or soda and the nail tech would ask my name it felt very warm and had a great atmosphere. \nNow, Polished has changed, they have expanded to 2 (almost 3) rooms and have a huge staff. They started electronic ads on billboards, e-mail promotions etc. EVERYONE knows about Polished. \nUnfortunately, I will no longer be a customer of polished. My last visit they stuck me with some guy who barely spoke to me and was nervously looking around. He did my pedicure which looked great then I got a simple manicure no gels just polish. He did a HORRIBLE job, he didn't clean up cuticles or file my nails. He painted them no where near the cuticle, it looked like I had gotten a manicure 2 weeks ago. Later that day they were already chipped, I'm not an idiot, I know nail polish chips, but they just looked horrible. I called Polished later that day and explained everything, The very sweet receptionist told me it would be NO PROBLEM to fix them because of their 7 day guarantee and she even told me she would put me with the best nail tech for the next appointment. \nWhen I went in to get them done the lady who did my nails did a great job, and even fixed a chip on my pedicure. I went up to the desk after my nails were dry and spoke with the receptionist, she then told me that because I selected another nail color that I would be charged, I said are you serious? I just spent $50 yesterday on a manicure pedicure that was done poorly. She went and asked the owner and said that they would do it for free this time but next time they would charge. I told them that was fine and thanked them very much. Then, my nail tech came back from speaking with the owner and the WOULD charge me. What? They explained that they could not do anything about chipped polish, I told them that I understand the chipping but the tech didn't even make it to the cuticle OBVIOUSLY this was not my fault and should be corrected, whether I choose another color or not. This is simple hospitality. And being a customer there for so long I was shocked. I paid my $8 to polished for my color change (they obviously really needed the money) I would have tipped the tech $10 if it was free, the nail tech should have just not said anything- and I still gave her a $2 tip. \nHonestly, Its not about the money Its the way I was treated. I would understand if I was trying to get a new gel set with 3 ombre color and glitter design and whatever else they up charge for. It was a simple manicure. \nPolished used to rely on great service, talented nail techs and a great atmosphere. Now its simply a cattle call for mass amounts of girls to get their nails done. The expansion has only led them to be more greedy, raise their prices, and not give a s*it about quality which they lack to produce. \n\nThis business is a sell out.",0
"Ordered a Vegan chocolate cake, with Buttercream frosting for our 10 year anniversary. This cake was amazing, better then we expected. We requested an usual cake for two people, its not on their menu, but they gladly made it for us. It lasted two days. After the first bite, it was so delicious we definitely could have went up a size.\n\nWe are looking forward to our next cake and highly recommend them.",4
I've always found the food to be very fresh. Read the menu carefully and order what sounds good. My kids love the Terriyaki chicken. Have not had a horrible dish but certainly prefer some dishes over others. I definitely recommend anyone give it a try. I like that the veggies are fresh and crisp. Staff is always helpful and the restaurant is always clean.,2
"Wir kommen gerade von dort. Trotz Anmeldung wurde auf den Geburtstag meines Mannes nicht eingegangen. Schade! Vier Servicekr\u00e4fte, die nicht koordiniert sind, erscheinen mir doch zu viel und verbreiten eher Unruhe, als eine angenehme Atmosp\u00e4re. Am Nebentisch gab es Butter und/oder Oliven\u00f6l zum Brot. Dieses Angebot bekamen wir und andere G\u00e4ste nicht. 1.Vorspeise: Hummersalat. War gut. 2. Vorspeise: Angel-Hecht mit Spargel, ebenfalls gut. Hauptspeise: Rinderlende mit Parmesan-Gnocchi und Gem\u00fcse. Ein rieisiger Reinfall! Fleisch rosa bestellt, grau und durchgegart bekommen. Dazu war ein Teil des Fleisches sehnig - geht gar nicht. Gnocchi ohne Geschmack, was bei PARMESAN-Gnocchi eine Kunst ist. Gem\u00fcse und Gnocchi war in der Zahl ein Witz (4 Gnoccichen, 2 fingernagelgro\u00dfe Karottenstreifen sowie ein ebenso kleiner Blumenkohl und ein Minir\u00f6schen Brokoli). Nachtisch: geeister Rhabarber Schaum mit Erdbeeren. In Ordnung, aber nichts besonderes. Dieses Men\u00fc gab es f\u00fcr 76EUR. Mein Mann ist nicht satt geworden. Weine waren gut und preislich in Ordnung. Evian f\u00fcr 7,30EUR. \nF\u00fcr das Publikum kann das Restaurant nichts. Man schien sich aber zu kennen. Der Atmosph\u00e4re tun Menschen in Tarnshorts und Basecap nicht gut. Auch die Gespr\u00e4chsthemen am Nebentisch waren nicht angenehm: Katzen die Hunde besteigen \nInsgesamt waren wir entt\u00e4uscht.",1
"So I wejt there Yesterday After probably not going for 8 Months. I just when to get a Full set..I asked the old guy who works there if he can do it. He said He will but i had to wait a couple mins.. waited almost an hour. Let that one go. Before he started going my nails i told him i wanted to clean my nails and remove cuticle, as if they were going to do a gel mani. Well he first did my acrlic nails. He didnt remove my old gel nail polish i had before. I told him if he was going to take the old red polish. he said \"" You no see after i paint your nails\""Not to mention that ones they \""removed my cuticle\"" the lady who did it cut my many times How are you not going to see the red under if i got just glitter on top?!!!! I told him i was going to be back... to paint tgem cause i had to leave my sister at work. I came back and he wasnt there so i picked thr grittler color i wantef. And i waited half an hour and Nancy \""COME SIT DOWN!\"" Being super rude! Go i sat down and ones i told her i that i just wanted glitter on my nails. she got mad and said \""Im not talking it off if you dont like it\"" So she started putting glitter on my nails, according to her she was putting the little blush that picks up the nail polish. but she didnt even put it in there. I was Sooo mad that she wasnt even trying to do so. So i told her if she can please add more glitter. and sge refused to. So i told her i was just going to do it at home. And i walked out the salon. Came back in there to get acetone. And i caugh thrm talking about me cause they said my name.\n\nI DO NOT RECOMMENT THIS PLACE AT ALL THRY ARE BUNCH OF ASSHOES!",0
"Had the \""yaori\"" omakase.  This was the $80.00 set.  All the fish they served were fresh as advertised.  The type of fish served were all delicious.  Really enjoyed the negi toro served on white rice at the end of the meal.  The scallions they added to the negi toro enhanced the taste of the fish.  I would recommend this for those who enjoy raw fish.  The staff were super friendly and helpful in explaining each dish.  I was impressed that upon leaving, my server walked me out.  That is quite impressive.  When you are in Vegas, this is a must destination.",3
"Gave this place another chance.  Tried to come here for my birthday a few months ago, only to face a 45 minute wait, a trip to their 2nd location, a waitress dumping a full soda on our table and finding out there was no crab - blue crabs, Dungeness crab, snow crab , king crab - NONE at all - only when our server took our order.  This time, I called ahead and yes, they had crab available.  \n\nPros - \n\nNo wait at 6:15 on a Friday night\nBeverages refilled promptly\nServers were friendly\nFood was good\n\nCons -\n\nTwo of us ordered Dungeness crab; and server gave each of us a claw cracker tool, and that was it.  No fork, no pick, not even a butter knife or even one of those \""sea sheller\"" plastic gadgets.  How did they expect anyone to eat crab without any other tools?  One of us ordered the lobster, and he did get the sea sheller tool.  When I asked for two more, the server said she wasn't sure if they had more, but she would look!  Come on, it's a SEAFOOD restaurant, and you can't give your customers something as simple as a plastic tool to open crab legs?  She did manage to bring two more to our table.\n\nOnly the crawfish included corn & potatoes.  I can understand not including sausage with boiled seafood, but one tiny potato and half an ear of corn for three people added $4 to our bill.  How hard could it be to just include this in every boiled seafood menu item?  Petty money grab, IMO. And . . .\n\nSausage, corn and potatoes were brought to the table 10 minutes before we got our seafood.  They were cold by the time we ate them with our seafood.\n\nMarinara sauce with mozzarella sticks from appetizer menu was cold.\n\nSeasoning description on menu could have had more information.  I have no idea what was in \""Juicy Cajun\"" or \""Louisiana Style\"" - White pepper?  Black pepper?  Red pepper?  Paprika?  No clue whatsoever with no information in the menu, and server didn't know either.\n\nParking lot is too small for the capacity of the restaurant.  \n\nIf you go -\nCall ahead and ask if they have the seafood you want\nPark on the street\nIf you plan on ordering crab, bring your own crab tools\nTell your server to bring the corn and potatoes with your seafood.",2
"Much better than I expected after reading these reviews.\n\nI went at around 8:30pm with a friend.  There were a good variety of foods, all of decent to great taste; the quality of the foods is slightly below that of Sushi99 (AKA still pretty good.)  There's free sodas if you're into that sort of stuff, and the central buffet includes some food seafood (shrimp/mussels/...lobster!!!)\n\nService was good too, nice waitress, nice cooks who brought out our food.",3
"This is a Mario Batali restaurant in Vegas' Palazzo Hotel and Casino - it's right across the skybridge from the Wynn. We came here for my sister's birthday dinner and left stuffed.\n\nProbably one of the more expensive places I've ever eaten at coming in at little over $100/person for a table of 7. I guess two bottles of $125 wine didn't help the matter =P Their somelier was really friendly, though. She did this whole presentation for priming the glasses for our wine by pouring a little into each GINORMOUS sized wine glass and rolling it around to clear it of polish, detergents, etc and to prep the glass with the smell of the wine. Did it help? I'll have to try primed/non-primed glasses at home to compare =P I didn't really notice that much of a difference, but I'm not a huge wine snob...\n\nThe restaurant's setting is decent - a sorta steakhouse feel right inside the Palazzo - but close enough to casion floor that you can still hear the sounds of slots. One look at the wine list and you sorta remember where you're at - wines from $100 - $5,000. Holy crap... haha.\n\nAnyways, on our server's suggestion, we shared 2 appetizers with the table and each ordered our own entrees and some sides.\n\nComplements of the Chef:\nFried Parmesean Balls - Just like it sounded... delicious =P On a side note, one of our Asian servers came up and pronounced the whole thing in fluent Italian. That was trippy... (*psst* Did he just speak Italian???)\n\nAppetizers: \nFresh Mozeralla over Toasted Bread - Pretty tasty stuff... but I was surprised when they brought out a huge slab of mozeralla and one tiny piece of bread. When the server described the plate, we thought each person would get a piece of bread... instead it was ONE regular sized piece of bread - we had to ask the server to cut it into seven for us =P\nGrilled Octopus - Excellent - wonderful smokey flavor with a hint of spice to three clearly different parts of the octopus - tentacle, body, and a bit of \""carpaccio\"" style octopus over a bed of greens and hot peppers. \n\nI ended up sharing the Ribeye with my brother-in-law. This must be ordered by 2 people and is $65/person. The presentation of the thing was pretty awesome. They come out with a huge plate with a ginormous slab of meat and bone, and after showing you, they trim the meat off and place the bone in front of you to tempt you... then they go and slice the meat into smaller portions so it's easier on you to cut and eat. I thought it was done really well - perfectly medium rare, tender, and a nice dry rub on the outside. I can't say it was THE BEST piece of meat I've ever had... especially at that price... but it was good.\n\nMy sister had their spaghetti ai fruti di mare and it looked amazing. HUGE prawns (head on), an entire lobster, crab... the works over spaghetti. Wish I had a bite =P\n\nSides:\nTheir sides come a la carte - so be careful! At $9 a pop, they add up, but the few we tried were pretty good.\n\nRisotto Cake - Sorta like a crab cake, but stuffed with risotto. I enjoyed it... you get two large cakes.\nSpinach with garlic and hot peppers - pretty tasty, but nothing super special.\n\nWe wanted the strawberry panna cotta for desert, but they ran out =(\n\nIn any case, it was a good dinner, but a little expensive. The wine was superb. The waiters were very helpful, if not a little overbearing... but I guess they try extra hard there. I'd go back to try some of their pastas... after winning big at the tables =P",2
"Based off the reviews, I really thought that I was going to be stepping into a run-down Motel 6 with muddy carpets and broken slot machines. Boy what a pleasant surprise Fiesta turned out to be.\n\nFirst off, you'll be hard pressed to find a cheaper spot in Henderson.  By now you should already be expecting that dreaded $9.99 resort fee.  On the plus side, for $30 bucks you get wifi that's good enough to stream non-HD videos (~1Mb/sec).  Internet...check.\n\nOn the way up, you'll pass by a decent-sized casino area with a movie theater and eateries like Dennys, Fatburger, and Subway.  Being this far from the strip, It's good to know at least I won't starve to death.  Late night grub...check.\n\nI was here on business, however, so I skipped the casino.  I've got a sensitive nose so a non-smoking room was a must.  I am pleased to announce that even with my hound-like schnoz, the hallway passed the sniffer test with flying colors.  Allergies...check.\n\nStep inside the room and you have, well, your basic room, which looked lifted out of the early 2000's.  Your basic amenities: one CRT TV roughly 27\"", 2-3 lamps that provided ample lighting, closet, and a restroom.  The beds were made, the restroom was nicer than I had pictured and came with a blow dryer and towels, and the shower didn't get clogged.  Above all, the room was clean.  Functionality...check.\n\nMy one complaint: the damn climate control.  It took me a minute or two of fiddling with the high tech central a/c remote before I realized that it wasn't hooked up.  In lieu of it, I discovered a retro wall-mount unit that did the job, perhaps a little too well.  I feel really bad for whoever has to sleep directly next to the blower.  A/C...meh.\n\nSo at the end of my stay, my overall impression of Fiesta is a positive one.  It provides excellent bang-for-the-buck, not nearly as ghetto as princess-types make it out to be, and seriously, was anybody really expecting the Cosmo?  Hell, you even get this thing called a \""news paper\"" dropped off at your doorstep every morning.  I have yet to figure out what that is, but rumor has it that old timers enjoy doing crossword puzzles on them.\n\nGreat value, check.",3
"Love this little family ran Vietnamese joint.  I live farther away but when I travel to north Scottsdale this is typically where I like to make it a point and go. Spring rolls, all the appetizers and soups are delish! You might be a little hesitant at first but once you order and take a bite you will be at ease. Also, if you are taking a first date here I dont suggest it. It is a very casual tiny place and is a cheaper menu so you may come off the wrong way. This place is more for a 2nd or 3rd occasion, when you want to show you know good hidden kept secrets in the area. If you're looking to be in and out stop in there.",4
idlis (rice cakes) can be used as a good weapon substitute. hard and reliable :),0
The large employee guy with blonde hair was belligerent and trying to start fights with several us last night. He needs to be fired and needs to be some changes made.,0
Modern and comfy...Tr\u00e9s Chic. Love the ambience! They had great selections of wine. Didn't order food but a friend ordered the grilled cheese and loved it. I wasn't in the mood to eat...which is why I'm only giving it 3 stars. The service was good.,2
"Man, I am going to miss Krua when I move back to Washington. I was pretty convinced the Southwest just didn't understand Thai food the way the West coast did, but I've been proven wrong. I'm updating my review because I finally got the chance to eat inside. I love the decor! It's just a small hidden place but it really is worth eating inside.\n\nI started with a water and a sweet Thai iced tea. I've never had anything like it! Super sweet and served with heavy cream on top. When stirred, the whole drink turns a bright orange. It was a really nice contrast to what we ordered..\n\nPineapple fried rice. Shrimp panang curry. Tofu pad thai. Veggie spring rolls. Get ready to say the Lord's name in vain, because that's all I can really do when I eat food from here. It's just great. I love the pad thai especially because it isn't overly greasy or soupy at all. The tofu was really good, pan-fried to perfection. And I like it hot! Even at a mere 'medium' spice it was burning my palate. The veggie rolls were meatless and were made with lots of pepper counteracted by the sweet and sour sauce. Steaming hot, extra-crisp. Great big portions make for plenty of leftovers for tomorrow's lunch.\n\nThe service is quick and the man who always seems to be working is so so friendly. We got pretty cold from a breeze coming in, and he even closed the door. \n\nI don't care what you Thai purists have to say... I get around when it comes to pad thai and this place is duking it out in my heart for first.",4
"This place is good, but not great.  I liked the outside patio and the burger was tasty, but they messed up our order and we had to wait a while before they got it right.  The burger was tasty and seasoned well but the fries and onion rings were mediocre.  I am glad we stopped in to try it, but I won't go out of my way to go back.",2
"Here's a GREAT choice...$17 buys anything on the menu (tip included). Sample the blueberry pancakes with a hearty side of their bone-in ham steak, bottomless cup of coffee & you're set for the day. Service is ALWAYS prompt & courteous. Conveniently located in the heart of Old Town Scottsdale.",3
"The sanitation score for this place was 93.0.....I guess that was a red flag that I missed before I placed my order.\n\nI will start with the 'good'. The cashier was very polite, inviting, and helpful. Thank you.\nThe cornbread was 'decent'. Hooray that it wasnt the Jiffy brand.\n\nNow the 'bad' ( and I mean REALLY bad!)\nRemember that stuff we called 'mystery meat' in grade school? Well apparently it's still around except now they bury it under BBQ sauce and call it meatloaf at Simmons restaurant. Arrrggghhh! The baked chicken w/dressing was 'do-able', but you can get the Banquet frozen chicken entrees at your local grocery and do much better. \nThe food was horrendous! The broccoli casserole was watered down and over cooked....soggy. Seems like they used imitation cheese, because it certainly didnt melt. (I even nuked it 4 minutes on HIGH in the microwave.....nope, it didnt melt). The so-called brown gravy was tasteless and bland. \n\nDon't waste your time....",1
Took care of my 3 dogs and did an awesome job. Facilities look very nice and dogs look spoiled. Very reasonable priced. I will go again.,4
This place is also a scam. Phos free for $60 when it's 29.99 everywhere else. All there products are overpriced.,0
"I will have to admit that I was pretty disappointed with Circus Circus buffet.  It was much better than I thought it would be.  I came here hoping to recalibrate my Vegas buffet meter and I was looking for something that was a 1 or a zero.  Not to say that there still aren't elements that put them in the running for the worst buffet I have been to - including totally dried out food items, and rude staff.\n\nLong gone are the days when you could eat here for 5 bucks and get the worst case of heartburn in your life. Anything that incorporated a meat mixture tasted like they were using offal in their food long before it became trendy.  But sadly, the price has gone up to just under $20 for dinner and so has the quality.  Now, instead of being horrendous, they have climbed the rank to reach the status of dorm food - just palatable and recognizable enough. (any place that has milk dispensers is guaranteed to be like dorm food)\n\nTo summarize my findings and some of the items\n\nCorn dogs - dried out and grey wieners just like you find at AM/PM\n\nSliced beef - I needed two gulps of water to get this baby down.  Dry dry dry\n\nFried chicken - greasy and dried out like the Hungry-Man frozen dinners\n\nTaco meat - amazing reproduction of the beef filling used in Taco Bell\n\nBurritos - an exact replica of Tina's 25 cent frozen burritos\n\nLasagna - Can we say Stouffer's?\n\nMac n Cheese - Kraft Mac n Cheese is cheesier\n\nand my favorite... there is a station that has some stuff just labeled as \""meat\"" - Awesome!!!",1
"The first thing we observed when entering the Hush Puppy was the overwhelming smell of bad seafood.  The service was good, but the food was just terrible.  The fried green tomatoes were bland and tasted like corn meal and salt, the hush puppies were generically mediocre and the salad bar was disgusting, with watered down lettuce and condiments.  The fried shrimp are all differently sized and the fried whole catfish was terrible as well.  Everything tasted like oily corn meal batter.  Before we got our check I had to make a mad dash to the restroom!  I would never go back and wouldn't be surprised if either Gordon Ramsey or Robert Irvine ending up using this disgusting establishment as an example of where to avoid.  Absolutely disgusting....I wonder what their kitchen looked like?",0
"I enjoyed my stay at the cosmopolitan up until check out. Check out was a horrible experience. This is due to the fact that I incidentally placed a stack of money on to my room service cart and noticed I did that after they took it away. Not 5 min after room service took the cart, I reported it and it took the cosmopolitan approximately 2 hours to respond. So when we located the cart of COURSE it was not on there any more. It just breaks my heart how un-loyal, disrespectful and dishonest the employees of cosmopolitan were. I wrote a report, but still have not heard back from them and I don't expect to hear back from them considering they have already shown me their true colors of dishonesty.",0
"A-okay mall. Kinda deserted. Lots of small shops. Not too many big names. Or I didn't get that far in. You should, however, stop by the \""Buy today, gone tomorrow' store. you might find a steal. I bought those cake pans that are shaped like a donut, oreo cookie or cupcake for only $7. I went to the as soon on tv store and they sold for about $25. A steal? Hell yeah. Same brand and all too.",1
"As much as I wanted to like this place, I have to say I really thought the food was overrated and overpriced. First of all, I wish there were more places to sit inside. They could have really perked this place up with a sit-in area- however, obviously the space is small and carry-out is pretty much the only way to go here. I have to say the food was good, but as other people have said the quality is not much of a step-up compared to the Taco Bell down the road. I got a rice and beans burrito, which was almost 6 bucks. The fact that even lettuce and tomato are extra ad-ons is ridiculous. I don't think I've ever seen that in any comparable food chain/restaurant. As other people have said as well, the people behind the counter were not very friendly. There is a fine line between fast service with no bullshit attitude and rudeness, and the couple of people who took my order there were right on the line. I do have to recommend trying their home-made salsa that they offered me, although there is almost no spice to it. Bottom line, one should go to the Taco Bell a few blocks away for similar quality food at a cheaper price.",2
"After visiting this hip little place, I ran away. The sashimi was great but the slices were so big you literally had to cut them down to bit size pieces. The rolls didn't even stay together & they were golf ball size in diameter. To add insult, I didn't even get everything I ordered. I will never go back and I have no clue why everyone is giving them such high reviews.",0
"one word - yuck.\n\nI used to live in Bruntsfield as a student and so would frequent the local take-aways. Globetrotters was, without a shadow of a doubt, the worst. The chips were disgusting, worse than Macdonals or Burger King and the fish...oh my God call that fish? It was like cardboard. Totally tasteless and dripping in grease. Also, the staff were not pleasant, leeching on all the young girls in the shop (not just me) and making the whole experience quite unenjoyable. If you want fish and chips, or anything for that matter, go elsewhere.",0

"The wait staff is clumsy and had difficulties serving our party of sixteen. Plates were mistakenly placed. There was a significant lapse of time between appetizers and main courses. But what was really appalling was the kitchen forgetting someone's riserva steak. When I say \""forget,\"" I don't just mean they sent it out a few minutes late. I mean we all finished eating by the time it came out. And then during dessert, they forgot that same person's coffee! \n\nMy entr\u00e9e was made up of two sides: Scallops A La Piastra and Italian Broccoli. The scallops had good presentation, but were cold. The broccoli was something just thrown into the dish, hanging out the side, etc. \n\nThe service, plating, and food are not worth $$$$.",1
"went here tonight with some friends for dinner,  started off with blooming onion, calamari and coconut shrimp.  They were accomadating with the calamari as I don't eat the tenticles, so they separated them out.  We also had soup.  the onion was wicked greasy and the calamari were so small,.I've never seen them that small.  For our entrees we had steak and lobster tail, fish and a burger.  Again, the lobster was so small...lol.  All in all it was meh...service was slow...shrimp appetizer came out after our entrees were served.  our server was nice enough...not a lot of interaction though.  If it weren't for the giftcards I don't think I would come here again.  Too expensive for the quality.",1
"For the record, we are long time Five Guys fans.  Eat there regularly.\n\nBut why is it that this one seems to specialize in goofing up some part of our order when we do take out?  \n\nYou shouldn't have to open up your packages before leaving the restaurant to ensure everything is 1) there and 2) accurate.  But this location makes you rethink that.  :-(",2
"On my most recent trip to Vegas, I had the pleasure of having breakfast once again at Verandah at the Four Seasons Hotel.\n\nMy mission:  To order the wonderful and flavorful corned beef and pastrami hash I ate on my last visit in '08.  My friend and I made reservations just to be on the safe side, I mean who knows how busy a restaurant may or may not be on Sunday morning (hint:  don't worry if you DIDN'T make reservations for Sunday breakfast).  \n\nAt first I thought we were going to be late because Las Vegas Blvd was closed for the marathon and so the police were diverting traffic elsewhere, in this case we made a u-turn and went back in the opposite direction we came from.\n\nThankfully we made it on time to for our 8am reservation.  One of the best things I've come to appreciate about Verandah is its location AWAY from the hustle and bustle of the Strip.  Since there isn't a casino in the Four Seasons, guests and visitors alike can enjoy the peace and serenity this restaurant has to offer.  And besides this tranquility, their service is just simply impeccable as well.  Everyone from the hostess to the servers make you feel very welcome and treat you like you're one of the Ocean's 11.\n\nBut now let's talk about the most important meal of the day:  Breakfast.\nAlthough there were other items on the menu that seemed appealing, as well as the buffet, we didn't deter from our mission and ordered our corned beef and pastrami hash.  Well, good things come to those who wait and this certainly was well worth waiting for.  Simply put:  One of the best breakfast meals I've ever had.\n\nBottom Line:  Peaceful.  Quiet.  Great Service.  Fantastic Breakfast.",4
"Solid 3-3.5 star spot!  I think the RIGHT burger could have pushed me to a 4 personally.\n\nIt's almost a \""hood burger\"" being on E Flamingo, without the super cheap prices and/or the home cookin' hospitality.  Don't get me wrong, it's not expensive by any means, just not a Fat Boy for instance.\n\nI went with the Pastrami Burger ($7.95): Chili, Swiss Cheese, Mustard & Pickle. SOLID burger, cooked to MR+ with initial juices on the squeeze.  The chili is pretty good too and was the highlight of the burger for me :)  \n\nThe burger also had lots of mustard...just wish the pastrami was a little more flavorful to compensate. It was cut thick, a bit chewy, and did not have the crispy / caramelized edges I love...reminded me of a less rendered pork belly / bacon consistency.  It definitely got hidden in the burger/chili combination, until you had to chew it up separately of course, since the rest of the burger melts in your mouth in comparison.\n\nAlso ordered the Chili Cheese Fries ($3.95). Didn't realize the Pastrami Burger already came with Chili, so I was quite overloaded with it LOL. These were topped off with LOTS of Cheez Whiz...good stuff!  A bit heavy in the end...I'd share with someone bigger than a 2yr old :P \n\nI also got to try Roger's Garlic Parmesan Fries...these were pretty tasty!  TONS of parmesan cheese clumped up in small bits, with a good amount of garlic flavor.  Recommended :)\n\nWith burger, chili cheese fries and a drink, I was at $15.  This felt fair in my book, but perhaps you guys should consider a combo meal (Roger's idea)?  One of the tame burgers, basic fries and a fountain drink for $9.95 for instance?\n\nI am sure I will be back to try another burger since it isn't too far from the strip :)",2
Great burger deal! Decent nighttime,2
"I ate here for the first time last week based on a recommendation from a teller at the nearby Wells Fargo. Always good to ask people who work nearby where they like to eat.\n\nThe restaurant is stylish and tidy with welcoming staff.  They have a lunch buffet, which we didn't bother with as we were eating lunch late. The waitress was in the middle if taking our order when another gal came over and insisted I change my salad order to the House Salad that isn't on the menu. I'm always suspicious of this, it happens a lot at Asian restaurants and I often feel obligated to go along with the recommendation. She was rather insistent, so I gave in. What can I say?  I'm a middle child so I dont like to let anyone down.  Well, for once I wasn't sorry, as this often goes quite terribly wrong. \n\nHere's our whole order:\n\nCrab Puffs, as expected but the sauce was nicer than the horrible orange stuff you usually get. \nHouse Salad, lovely chopped salad with a mildly tangy sauce and crunch cabbage and almonds (no meat)\nThai Shrimp Salad, spicy with big shrimp. \n\nEverything was wonderful.  They actually gave us an extra dish after my aunt said how she likes things really spicy. It was a spicy chicken dish that was also delicious. \n\nI'll definitely be back to this restaurant, although it's nowhere near my house in Mesa, but luckily my aunt lives close by!",3
"My boyfriend and I just moved to Phoenix, and we were looking for a nice place for pizza. Luckily, Spinato's was just around the corner. The service was fantastic, with a wait time around seven minutes. Curious about their tea, our server allowed us to have a sample (in a rather large cup) of their green tea. Ultimately, we didn't order any tea, but our server provided consistent, positive service. My boyfriend and I ordered a large Da' Greek pizza for our meal. While the pizza combination was delicious, I did find a slight flaw. The only thing I didn't like was the amount of moisture soaked into the crust. I'm not sure if that's how the pizza is supposed to be, but it was almost impossible to eat without a fork. There was enough pizza to take home though, and the leftovers lasted us for a couple of days. Also, be sure to try the Cider. SO GOOD!",3
"I was up in this part of town at lunchtime today, so I whipped in here to Al's.  This is a stylish, good-sized place, & it was already almost full of lively diners at 11:45!\n\nThings got off to a good start, with a whole pitcher of ice water landing on the table, along with a basket of excellent chips & a nice carafe of tasty salsa.  I ordered a #7 Combo, which arrived pretty soon as a roasting hot platter with a Chile Relleno, a beef tamale, a hard shredded beef taco, & a bit of salad.\n\nThe prices are a little high (but obviously they are getting away with it), & they give you a small plate to scoop up your salsa from, instead of a more useful bowl, but of course you can get one for the asking.\n\nThe service was good, & this was a big, delicious lunch.  I don't know if Al is really an A-Ho.., but he can cook!     :-))\n\n#7 Combo $11.45",3

This time, the food seemed more overpriced, the portions seemed smaller, and taboo of all taboos, the rice was definitely not cooked thoroughly. And, to top it all off, the service was....well, just bleh! We kept having to look for and flag down our server. When the restaurant isn't very busy, that does not bode well with us, especially when we are sitting AT the sushi bar and they wouldn't let us place over-the-counter orders - their bad!\n\nWith all the choices for good and great sushi in the greater Phoenix area, we won't be going back to Sushi Eye...",1
"I would gladly give this place less than 1 star if I could. I went in here to get a haircut after reading the reviews and and found the place to look like a good modern barber shop. \n\nAfter sitting and telling the owner of the shop what I wanted (a military high and tight). He commenced to cutting my hair the way he felt it should be cut. I interrupted him several times telling him that he was not doing as I asked. He simply said \""what you want is wrong.\"" He told me it wouldn't look right. HMMM, I could be wrong, but Isn't that up to THE CUSTOMER??? He refused to cut my hair the way I wanted. \n\nThis review wouldn't be complete without telling how during the entire haircut, he kept sneezing and continued to blow his nose into one of the barber towels then went right back to touching my head. \nThat was just plain DISGUSTING!!! \n\nAll that and this place is waaaay overpriced!!!!!\nCount me out on this place!",0

"I was pleased with the doctor who saw me and grateful that he noticed a potentially precancerous mole that required excision. However, I canceled my follow-up appointment for the actual surgery after the clinic's billing department double-billed me for charges the insurance company had already paid. They refused to acknowledge their error, even though the insurance company had proof that the provider had cashed the payment checks a month earlier. It took some time, but the insurance company resolved the issue. After having the surgery performed by another dermatologist two hours away, I was surprised to receive yet another bill from Arizona Skin & Laser for charges that they had resubmitted to the insurance company for the original services. Again, my insurance company assured me I owe nothing, and they are in the process of resolving the second issue with the provider. I will say that the front-office staff was friendly when I canceled the surgery appointment, although they did not seem surprised or concerned when I informed them of the billing issue. Months later, I still have not received an apology or even an acknowledgement from the provider. All I have received is a CYA letter, sent my certified mail, reminding me of the need for the follow-up surgery and asking that I contact them so they can update their medical records if I had the treatment performed elsewhere. At this point, I plan to have no further direct contact with them. I'm not sure whether their billing department is unusually incompetent or worse, but if you choose to have services performed at this clinic, be sure to read carefully all bills you receive from them to verify their accuracy.",0
"I like Ike! No seriously though, this place is pretty good. I look forward to coming again.",3
"Talk about awesome. I always manage to forget this place is nearby. It took seeing a Jimmy Johns to stop in the plaza and remember it the other day, and a few days later, as a friend and I were both low on groceries, we decided to head over. It's one of her favorite places to go, and as soon as we walked in I could see why. \n\nIt's like a sushi dive bar.. the perfect sushi place to have near your house. It's the place you can walk into in your pajamas and not feel out of place. It's the sushi place you can enjoy easily by yourself. There is no bar to sit by, but it doesn't even really seem to bother you while you're there. \n\nThe staff remembers you and your name... and your order. And whether it's to dine in or take out, you are served quickly. The menu is simple and makes ordering quick. I decided to go with a Philadelphia and a spicy salmon. I was completely satisfied. It was filling, just the right size, and very well made. \n\nHappy hour has some great sake and half off roll specials that sound like a great after work trip some lazy middle of the week when I feel like going out but without all the dolled up drama. What a win!!",3
"Such a disappointment :(\nI was really looking forward to eating here after finding it on Yelp!  My son & I came here today for lunch after his doctor's appointment.  I skipped breakfast because I was expecting to have a big lunch.  I ordered their lobster roll which came with fries & coleslaw, a small corn chowder, and chicken strips for my son.  Fries were soggy, not a single one was crispy; lobster would have been good if they didn't smother it in so much mayo, and the parsley that they sprinkled on top made my stomach turn; clam chowder was nothing special- tasted like it came out of a can.  On a positive note, my son enjoyed the chicken strips but didn't touch his fries, and that's a big shock since fries are his favorite food.  It's been almost two hours since we consumed the food, and sadly both my son & I are beginning to feel nauseas & queasy.  Would not be recommending this place nor would we be returning. :(",1
"Greasy and bland.  I had to raid my Asian sauce collection from the pantry to drown my food in multiple sauces to produce any noticeable flavor.  \n\nI was on my way home and placed a call in order for delivery, using my credit card to pay.  Since the boyfriend was home to receive the order, this seemed like a wonderfully convenient idea, which I would later learn otherwise.  The delivery driver arrives and informs boyfriend, \""No card, no food.\""  They failed to advise of this little detail that the credit card and ID must be present and offered for review at the time and location of delivery, otherwise they will give you the food.  The delivery driver took the food back to the restaurant and informed boyfriend that I would have to drive there to pick up my delivery order and show them my credit card before they would release the order.  So, I go pick up my delivery order and ask for a refund of the delivery fee.  At this time they inform me that my card was already charged at the time of the order, also at the same time they could have informed about their policy that they won't deliver the food if the card isn't on location.  They couldn't figure out how to refund the delivery fee, so in my frustration I told them not to worry about it, as I decided that we would rather eat our food while it's still luke warm, rather than completely cold.",0
"I didn't eat here, but I got a freakin' daquiri in a guitar (100 oz) to carry around. I'm a musician, so that was pretty fun. The drink is pretty weak and takes about half of it to get you tipsy (even for someone petite like me), but it's worth the novelty, and they give you a free coconut. And despite being trained to be obnoxious, the employees were actually really nice.",2
"Two and a half stars, a couple of things bothered me.\n\nThe steak is sorta decent for the price, but it's no Delmonicos, na'mean? I mean, I think it would decent for the price. Read on.\n\nI got the 20 oz Montana Ribeye, the \""cowboy cut\"" steak at this place. My waitress was gushing about how big it was, I told her to re-focus on the steak and stop staring at my lap. No, but seriously, she was gushing about how big it was, and I almost took her home. Ok, but seriously, she wanted it.\n\nNo, but seriously... the steak was supposed to be huge? Maybe it started as 20oz, but it definitely shrank. Fine, whatever, it was still a decent size, but it wasn't as big as the T-bone my father got.\n\nI ordered my steak medium, it came out well done. I DO NOT like well done steak. I think if the steak came out cooked correctly, it might have been good. Since cooking a steak well done basically renders it flavorless, I was legitimately surprised when there were moments that I actually tasted delicious rib eye and not charcoal. \n\nThere were some decent beers on tap, the service was good, the ambiance was better than I expected. This place is a block or so away from my house, so I figure I'll be back. I have to write a follow up review for it. So far, though, not impressed. I wasn't expecting a five star steakhouse, but if you're selling steaks, you should at least have a chef that can time it correctly.\n\nOh, the raspberry chocolate cheesecake was incredible. That's why this is a 2-2.5 star rating and not a 1-2 star one :)",1
"Stopped in for lunch to have a quick bite.... Very impressed! Nice atmosphere, the staff was friendly and the food was GREAT at a good price! I had the chicken cream chop pita...would definitely recommend it!",4
"As a breakfast snob I really do not like Denny's.  They don't really do anything especially well.  Also, I've had inconsistent quality of food and helpfulness of staff on different occasions.  I can't slam this place for one unpleasant waitress, but I can for those inconsistencies and that fact that there are just so many other places that do what they do better.\n\nIn fact, this place was the very last Denny's I ever ate.  The food took forever, it wasn't well done, came out all screwed up, and the waitress was unpleasant.  After that experience I decided to never set foot in another Denny's.",1
"The lunch gyro is always the way to go for me. The meat is very tender and delicious, and their fries are also very very good. Their cups are over sized so when you are paying $2 for an ice tea (like every where else) at least you don't feel completely ripped off here.\n\nThe service is always fairly quick, and there is not a seat in the house where you can not see a T.V, just incase there is a game on.\n\nThe only thing that was a little downer was how loud the music was. A group of us from work went there for lunch and WoW.... It was like being in a club. We have been there several times and not had this issue, but last Friday the had it cranked up.",3
Disappointed with the delivery. Ordered Honey Walnut Shrimp and it was placed in a to go container with a side salad with ranch dressing. By the time it got to my house the lettuce was hot and wilted and the ranch dressing had mixed all over the shrimp. It was pretty gross. Will not order from again.,0
"Way too expensive here, charging 2600 and up for a puppy? No thanks, I'll keep looking elsewhere. \n\nSales lady we had was very pushy, kept saying we could finance through them. They have to get commission for selling animals.  She didn't even seem to care what type of environment the puppy would be going to and kept saying that my husky would immediately get along with any puppy.\n\nAlso, saw a dog eat it's own poop in one of the glass windows.  Doesn't seem like they take care of their animals here. Some puppies were sleeping on each other and she just grabbed one of them and said look at this puppy!\n\nVery disappointed, hopefully this place will learn to price more fairly and will take better care of their animals.",0
I should have not eaten here after I smelled inside. Gross. Got sick that night vomiting every 30 min.,0
"Very unprofessional. I have had delivery from this location in the past, and now suddenly they won't deliver. Very upsetting considering that they have never had issues delivering to is before. Ended up getting dominoes with No problems at all. Supervisor wouldn't let me speak with anger to voice my concern.",0
"Worst mexican in madison so far. I went there with six friends, all getting different items. The enchiladas verdes were light on filling, sauce and cold. Covered in queso fresco and another cheese sauce. One friend had a veggie burrito, which lacked any more vegatables than rice and beans. another frined had the tacos, both steak and chicken were dry and lacked any flavor. a few people had the horchata and as one of my friends said: \""from a box and not even a good box\"". All in all, one of the worst meals i have had in madison. I will not be returning, and neither will my friends.",0
"$20 all you can eat sushi. This place is away from the strip. Came here with a big group of friends (13 people) and they put our tables together and we were seated within couple mins. Their special rolls are the best. I like how you can order ANYTHING u want off their menu (appetizers, sushi, soups, desserts) since some place only have limited selection and you can order as many time as you want. Our group ordered so many rolls I don't even remember which rolls we got. We were so full we almost didn't finish but we made sure we did so they wouldn't charge us extra for not finishing (not sure if they do but most AYCE restaurants do charge for not finishing). I like how how you can order mochi ice cream as many times as you want (strawberry and chocolate mochi ice cream YUMMY!), I don't know any other AYCE sushi places that do that. The service was good especially for a big group like ours. If I'm ever craving AYCE sushi in Vegas, I'll make sure to come back here.",4
"Wow where to begin?!\n\nLet me start off by saying VICTORIA is the biggest bitch!\n\nNow let me clarify.  I'm a local. We went to Palms to do something special for my wife's bday. I was convinced by Palms booking agent over the phone that the Palms Place tower was the place to be. What a fucking joke. THE BALCONY WAS LOCKED! I called the front desk and they told me that they recently decided that ALL balconies would be off limits. What am I in fucking kindergarten?! When I called to have my balcony unlocked I spoke to Victoria.  She told me it was a new policy. When I told her it was unacceptable and asked to be moved to a different tower she refused. I informed her I felt misled. She said she would listen to the recorded phone call of me booking the room to see if I was truly misled. SERIOUSLY?!!!!!? I told her that she wouldn't hear me being told the balcony would be unlocked BUT she also wouldn't hear me being told it would be locked! When I told her it was not acceptable and I wanted to be moved to a different tower she refused. She said I was already In the room (15 mins) and would be charged FULL PRICE!. After a lot (seriously a lot) of bitching on my part, Victoria told me if I was out of the room in 30 mins I would get a full refund.  So of course, out of principal, I rounded everyone up and we left.  There was a scene In  the lobby where I called VICTORIA out about  being a bitch. I said you were so rude to me on the phone and now that we're face to face you want to be quiet. I WAS FURIOUS! She threatened to call security...i said fucking call metro. Sure enough security came and belive it or not but THEY WERE ON MY SIDE! They were the most respectful people I encountered all day at the Palms. I was still angry and telling them how great the Palms used to be and that the Maloof family sold at the perfect time because the Palms is just going down hill.  They agreed and said you have no idea how often we hear this. \n\nLONG STORY SHORT...FUCK THE PALMS AND STAY AWAY....GO TO THE COSMOPOLITAN.....BALCONIES ARE OPEN AND PEOPLE TREAT YOU WITH RESPECT!!!!!!!",0

"This is the worst buying experience I have had in at least 10 years!  Julie Gugino, blind consultant, came to our brand new house to measure for blinds. I told her that the most important thing for us was to have the CORDLESS blinds and we picked out and ordered $2900 worth of CORDLESS blinds from her.  \n\nWhen the installer came to the house (the first time), he told my husband that he was missing something and would be right back.  Well, he came back more than 5 hours later when we were not home!  We rescheduled and then he came with blinds that ALL had cords!\n\nWe told him that the blinds were not right and to take them back.  He said he would just go ahead and put them up because the hardware would be the same and it would be easy to swap out them out when the correct ones had been made.  \n\nA couple of days later (today), I received a call from Julie Gugino telling me that she had been the one to make the mistake when she submitted the order.  She asked what she could do to make us happy and we told her to get us the blinds that we ordered and paid for!  She sounded like she was crying and told me that she was going to have to eat the cost for her mistake!  Frankly, I could care less!  She wanted to try to guilt me into keeping the blinds that I did not want!  When I told her to call me when they are ready for installation, she hung up without even saying goodbye!  \n\nHouse of Window Coverings was referred to me by Costco and I have now called Costco as well to tell them that they should NEVER recommend this VERY unprofessional business to anyone.  I will be receiving a call back within 48 hours from one of the Costco special services managers.",0
"I am giving Flamingo Palace 5 stars because they have the best food and service of any Chinese restaurant I've tried in Phoenix.  I like Bamboo House and Superdragon, too, but this is by far my favorite.\n\nMy in-laws are Chinese food experts.  I never thought we could get them to like Chinese food in Phoenix as they are from New York, where good Chinese food lives.  But they love Flamingo Palace.  Every time they visit us, they ask to go there.\n\nI just had my book club there and they were so awesome!  We had heaps of food and each was better than the next.  Plus, the service was just amazing- this with 13 people in our group.  I had such a pleasant, stress-free experience.  They gladly substituted chicken for pork, and as other people have noted, their chicken is the good stuff.  Also, they are very generous with shrimp, meat, etc.\n\nPeople in my group actually ordered alcoholic drinks from their ample drink menu, which I've never really noticed before.  I'm not much of a drinker.  But everyone really enjoyed the plum wine.  It was pretty cool that they have some different things to offer than a lot of other Chinese restaurants.\n\nFor example, try the house Flamingo chicken.  It is so good.  We wiped out their szechuan chicken, it was spicy and fantastic.  I also highly recommend their pu pu platter and spicy shrimp.  Yum!",4
My poutine had what looked like ashes in it!! And the manager is extremely rude. Has no customer service skills whatsoever. Service is bad and food mediocre. I will never return here again!,0
stopped in for drinks and a bite to eat had the angus sliders... just ok... dry buns and the burgers looked like half dollars on the bun; small... drinks were ok and can't mess up a beer so maybe next time...,1
"I can't say enough good things about this park.  It is HUGE, 10 acres according to the website and even that sounds understated.  My puppy and I have already met all sorts of new and interesting creatures.  There's a pretty good variety of terrain too.  The open fields are broken up by patches of prairie grass and light woods.  Most owners seem to pick up after their dogs too, its rare that I run into any messes.  The park district does a good job of supplying bags and keeping the common areas clean. There's even a community bin for tennis balls and throwers that is usually pretty full. But, previous posters are correct, and they don't seem to enforce membership.  Regardless, this resource is well worth the annual membership costs, and just imagine how amazing it could be if everyone did pay that fee.\n\nI have encountered some semi-aggressive dogs, the admittedly my Whippet just runs away from them laughing.  Be on alert with new dogs and be ready to jump in to rescue your pooch if need be.",4
DON'T STAY! BED BUGS!\nBy far the WORST experience my boyfriend and I have ever had on Vacation! Checked into our room on time and our room wasn't even ready. The cleaning lady had us waiting in the hallway with our luggage for over 20 minutes! Service was horrible! To add to our Vacation my boyfriend got multiple bed bug bites all over his arms and back! NEVER GOING BACK!,0
"I had my ignition switch freeze up on my GTO at the car dealership and the dealership couldn't figure out how to fix it. I was so frustrated. The dealership wanted $1500 to put a new ignition switch in my car. I've heard about Pop-A-Lock and thought I should try them, so I decided to call. I am so glad I did! The friendly Pop-A-Lock tech said get a can of WD-40 and squirt a little in the ignition and then try the key again. So I did. And IT WORKED! The wonderful Pop-A-Lock tech said no charge, just call me next time and recommend us. So here I am!!! Use these guys, they are better than the, know it all, dealerships. :)",4
"Been here once a few years ago; didn't have a good experience then but my family and I gave it another try. This is the LAST TIME!\n\nHostess: rude & unpleasant...she didn't seem to enjoy her job! What a shame!\n\nWaitress: no patience, lack of communication & outlandishly RUDE. She lacks the understanding of her customer's special requests.\n\nThe food was alright, not the best but decent enough to consume.",0
Loved the decor and the vibe. Great breakfast/brunch spot downtown. It's fantastic to have a place in Vegas that isn't a touristy breakfast spot and it made me think of breakfasting in other cities I have visited like San Diego. It's great to have a unique little culinary treat to add some culture that isn't a gut-busting breakfast buffet or a greasy spoon (nothing wrong with those if that is what you are looking for). \n\nThe coffee was amazing. It was one of the best cups of coffee I have had in a while. I ravenously consumed the shrimp and grits and it did not disappoint. The flavor combination hit the spot.,4
"What an awesome little shop! Beautiful nail designs, awesome customer service and attitude, all while keeping things professional and clean. I went in on a Wednesday around 2pm for a pedicure and the place was bustling. I waited maybe 5 minutes for a chair to open and a technician to be free. Nice vibe, and GREAT price! \nHad a manicure done later in the week, and her shaping was perfect. Would give 5 stars, but they do not have shellac or gel polish, which is a beneficial technology upgrade!\n\nUpdate 8/2012\nThey now have shellac and gel polish, so they get 5 stars! way to upgrade!",4
"I've never had a bad experience at changing hands. The staff is always so pleasant and eager to help. Whenever I can't find something, they'll make sure I either walk out the door with that book or make sure I find it elsewhere. They even showed me a website that has no affiliation because I was looking for an older and more rare book. Now that's customer service! Plus having the wildflower cafe next door is a plus because it makes for a good mother/daughter lunch date :)",4
"Spend the extra 10.00 and go to Bacchanal.  Really.\nThe layout of this buffet is not patron friendly.  I was almost ran over several times, felt like frogger trying to get back to my table,  \n\nWe went for a brunch arrived at 10:30 on a busy Sunday.  They should be on their A game, not so much.\nFood was dry and flavorless.    Dessert options were very, very limited.  \nNot impressed, at all.\nReally, Bacchanal. Its the BEST buffet around.",1
I found Gaylee to be the most unprofessional nail tech.  I found her on an internet deal.  I called her on Sat and requested an apt on the following Friday.  She never returned my call till I reported her.  She denied my 5 messages and said she only got one msg which she couldn't return cause she lost her voice.  She conveniently had a voice after she was investigated.  I would never trust her to do my nails.  Yet reading the reviews she did return some calls.,0
"The rich red walls, comfortable leather booths, and colorful artwork makes for a cozy place to eat. My friend and I got there around 5:30 and it was empty. Usually this is not a good sign, I would have turned around if my plus one did not have a living social coupon. \n\nThe wait staff were quick to welcome and sat us in a quiet corner booth. The restaurant picked up after 6, but the noise level was minimal. The busser came by to refill our drinks and cleared the table of dirty dishes promptly.\n\nThe dinner buffet was lacking for $17. There were minimal choices and some of the dishes were room temperature. The tandoori chicken had a nice flavor, but was dry. The chicken curry was flavorful and the meat was moist. The cauliflower in curry sauce was one of my favorite dishes, but there wasn't anything else that stood out. with a total of 10 dishes on the line, you will have no problems trying everything. There are better Indian restaurants in Las Vegas.",2

Very disappointed. Showed Fran a picture of what I wanted....shoulder length with face framing layers. Ended up with a jaw length bob...which I absolutely hate. \n\nWanted 8 inches cut off to donate & she cut 12 inches off.

"OK so first off this is a very popular place when I ate here it was very busy. In fact it was so busy I felt like I was at some government service office. Screaming babies lots of people cluttering the aisles. When i first came in I went to use the restroom,there were a ton of un-bused tables not very attractive or sanitary. My waitress was  helpful but over the top fake customer service. Now to the food....why doesn't anyone know how to make a proper hollandaise sauce? Powder mix all the way,average bordering on not really good at all. And the potatoes they serve,omg.They had more salt then the dead sea...easy with the salt moses your killen me. I felt like i was getting hyper tension with each bite.Then I go to check out,lady behind the counter doing something counting receipts finally looks up at me and says how are you,im fine. she goes back to doing what she was doing...lol ..ok np ill just wait for you dear. Please give me five singles as my change ,she hands me a 5...here take this 5 and put it towards a new hearing aid.....this place might be ok to soak up a hangover but other then that mediocre at best...pass.",1
"In November I bought a Blackberry Playbook  and was so happy that I could use it for work in conjunction with my blackberry! \n\nI used it for a couple weeks and was frustrated that I could not get it to bridge to my black berry. Then I was out of town and it was working fine and then in the middle of the day it just died. \n\nI figured I might have left it on and the battery died. Later when I got back to the hotel and tired to charge it, it would not charge. This went on for a few days, not understanding why I could not charge it. Frustrated that I spent weeks now moving all my data to the device and was out of town and kind of held hostage work wise, I then called the RIM customer service when I returned home. After explaining the issue, we determined the charger was faulty. \n\nThe customer service rep instructed me to go to Future Shop/Best Buy and find a changer and see if the device takes the charge and if it does to call them back from the store and they would advise me what to do. \n\nI left my condo and did as requested. About and hour later I called them and they were puzzled as to why I was given such an instruction and apologized for the inconvenience, and advised me they would replace the charger and send it right away. \n\nThey also advised me I could use my BlackBerry charger to at least change the device until the stronger charger arrives. That was 18 days ago and yesterday I finally received the replacement charger.  During this 18 days, I received 3 emails from RIM indicating that the charger is being shipped, then an email indicating the tracking number but provided no shipper info......the whole process was very unprofessional.\n\nLove the playbook, (which is now bridged to my blackberry), but do not feel the customer service for RIM is very responsive.",0
"Hilarious warehouse location converted into a restaurant with the inside painted like it's trying to be an Olive Garden or possibly a funeral home.  Lots of space & seating inside, and overall service was prompt.  Food was very good, especially the home fries which were cooked well (slightly crispy) which was just right for me.  Omelette is a good size, and pancakes were alright however the syrup was flavorful.  Good portions, good value, and not a pretentious atmosphere.",3
Wow!  I wasn't let in because I was wearing the wrong kind of shoes. They said my nikes were too nice. What crap.  Won't ever go to that place again. One star is too generous.,0
"I've been hitting different venues around Charlotte for years listening to live music...including Visulite Theatre.  It's a favorite pastime of mine.  Last night we went to check out Shooter Jennings (who is awesome by the way).  When I got there I asked one of the bartenders for a couple of waters.  He had immediate attitude b/c I wanted water and then charged $3 per bottle.  Later, I went to the other bartender for another water.  Hmmm, he charged me only $2.  Being a local Charlottean who supports a lot of local music, that left a very bad taste...\n\nAs far as the venue, it's got a lot of potential but it needs some sound system updates.  If you are up close in the pit, you can see great, but the sound is muffled b/c the speakers are actually over your head.  \n\nDefinitely prefer Double Door and Neighborhood Theater to hear music....",1
Be sure to get their Indian Curry. You won't be disappointed.,4
"During October, we visited this cute farm (actually red like the children's books) with the family and had a great time. They have hayrides pulled by Clydesdale horses; a \""petting zoo\"" (free roaming goats and horses behind a white wood fence); live Polka band; picking of all types of apples, pumpkins, and raspberries. They have a store where you can buy typical items like apple spice mix, pumpkin pancake mix, and apple butter. They offer wagons to either put your toddler in  or the items in the orchard. Except for the items you picked or buy at the store, everything is FREE. \nWe took some nice pictures there and had a good time.\nwww.eplegaarden.com\nIf you attempt to visit, you should go eat at Buraka in Madison (8 miles away) and it will end your day just perfect.",3

"Very, very bad.  Dinner at Border Grill was so incredibly bad.  We chose it as a somewhat affordable option with what would probably a solid menu of known Mexican staples.  The prices seemed high, but we were tired and hungry and didn't want to go far.\n\nI am not a woman of the most discerning taste.  I love a good sloppy enchilada so I'm not a refined foodie.  The food at Border Grill was so bad that I actually considered complaining that I shouldn't even have to pay my bill.  In the end we sucked it up as a loss because we were too tired to deal with a wait staff that had already proven themselves to be less than adequate.",0
"AWESOME food, even the salad, and I don't normally like salads.  We had lasagna, stromboli, cannoli, garlic knots, it was all delicious.  The meatball stromboli was my favorite.  Very friendly staff.  If we lived in the area we'd definitely be back more for more!",4
"Just ate at the restaurant after reading the reviews on yelp. The service and people were nice, but the stone crab claws were mealy (the fatty part, not the meat). We spoke with the waitress and a manager. they were both gracious and took off 20% from the bill, but the manager said that's how the crab was suppose to be, \""because it came from the ocean.\"" I've never had a mealy crab before. I didn't like the texture. The flavor was good.\n\nAccording to the menu, one crab claw was ripped from each crab on the boat, and the crab was then released. I'm guessing that the claw has to be frozen with this technique.  I'm accustomed to having the whole crab just boiled live. Maybe mealy crab is something to get accustomed to for sustainability?",1
This is a great place to go to have a nice quiet drink and amazing food with some close buddies. Had the best bartender who was attentive and lax to be consistent with the chill vibes in the place. A must for sushi lovers and tasty drink enthusiasts alike.,3
Everything would have been perfect if...\n\n1)My requests were fulfilled but unfortunately they were not. I booked a Panoramic Suite requesting a view of thr fountains and a fully equipped kitchen.. but they actually put me on the other side with a view a side view of Cosmo.. and an empty kitchen.. \n\n2)it said the panoramic suite came with 1 and a half bathroom but it actually only had 1 bathroom. Or at least the room I got only had 1 bathroom.\n\nOther then that the room was spacious pretty much a small 1bedroom apartment. I was disappointed that I didn't get my request but it's ok. Inquired about a complimentary upgrade. She gave it a shot but they were sold out the point is she tried which was cool. I  would definitely come back to the Vdara.,3
"Overall, the food was mediocre. I've had much better  bun at many other restaurants. Spring rolls were quite tasty however. The pho was acceptable, but light on veggies and herbs. Service on the other hand was absolutely terrible! Very rude waiter and waitress! Would not go back again just because of that!",1
"Simply wonderful. Razz is quite possibly one of the most gracious chefs in the valley. His establishment is exactly what casual fine dining is about. Pricey? Yes. Delicious? Absolutely. And imaginative as well. \n\nThe crowd was mixed in age and from the chatter overheard around us, quite knowledgable in the culinary arts. The waitstaff were all very kind and helpful, and not a single sour look was given when we presented our Groupon. The decor in general feels a touch dated, but in a comfortable way.\n\nOur five course tasting menu was fantastic right from the start. We sat at the Chef's table portion of the bar where Chef Razz promptly introduced himself and presented us with a crab stuffed squash blossom settled in a curried broth with rhubarb compote. Our second course, a lightly seared flounder atop black beans with candied ginger was a tasty surprise. Following that was a red wine braised beef tongue on a cheese corncake. And then came the reason I'll be returning. A decadent seafood mac and cheese. Plump chunks of lobster and shrimp awash in a savory 5 cheese blend. Comfort food at its finest. Ending up our meal was a combo of duck confit with bacon/nopales reduction and an italian meat and cheese filled crepe with pomodoro chile sauce. And the passionfruit pistachio layer cake is not to be missed for dessert.\n\nAll throughout the meal, Razz was happy to answer any of our questions and made us feel quite at home and welcome. An altogether wonderful dining experience.",4
"This place is probably at the top of most Montreal tourists' lists. Old school Jewish deli specializing in a Montreal favorite, smoked brisket.\n\nI had the fatty brisket, with a pickle on the side. The meat itself was only lightly smoky, but very tender. I used more of the mustard for an extra kick. The pickle was a heavy style pickling. \n\nAnd of course, you're to wash it all down with the black cherry cola. A cheap and fast meal at this Montreal institution.",2
I love their food but as per usual the person answering the phone was acting like a complete dick. Ya know I'm so tired of these places opening up & you love their food but the service SUXXXX! wtf is wrong w/u ppl?! You're open til 10pm but stop taking orders @ 930pm?! WTF?ON A SATURDAY NIGHT?! \nShame On You TGP! Get some adults to run your shop instead of kids & you'll do better,0
"Drinks are fine, doughnuts are not.  Any store that has to rely on getting them from another location is never a good sign.  The chain has overexpanded and is focusing too much on other products.  They need to change their name since doughnuts are not their primary focus anymore.",1
"This was a Groupon find and I am glad we found it. First off, getting in was not easy. We ended up parking at the mall and walking. \n\nThe food was amazing. My wife is normally so-so with meat and cheese plates but even she enjoyed everything on that app. The pizza was among the best we've had in the valley. The deserts were generous though not huge.\n\nNow for what really stood out. The service. Our waiter was the most helpful I've ever met in a restaurant. He gave us advice but was not just pushing the expensive items. He was always there when we wanted a refill or had a question but was never there when we just wanted to talk.\n\nThere was live music and the singer was good and fit the ambiance of the restaurant perfectly. Overall it was a prefer dinner out to relax and enjoy some great food. This was one of those times that Groupon put a place on our radar for the next time we are across town.",4
"Have been here several times now and they are consistently great. They really do put the other place I used to go to to shame!  So glad to have found a place you can trust, who do a good job with great prices too.",4
"The owner also owns Blu Burger next door which is good. But teatro is a disappointment. Blah pizza, blah chicken dish. Service OK. I can't stand a restaurant that has its servers make the cocktails which seems to be a trend lately with restaurants that are trying to keep costs down. That's the wrong place to manage margin. Plus it's usually a bad drink.",1
"Ya' know when you experience a restaurant environment at the perfect time? The ambiance fits your mood, the wait staff is great, and the food is even better? \n\nThat just happened. \n\nI'm here on a bustling Sunday morning with my laptop at the bar. As I look around, literally everyone is smiling, including the wait staff. You can tell they love working here, and it shows. \n\nBeing a bit of an espresso snob, I was a little hesitant to order it at a restaurant like this, but I was not disappointed. My 4-shot iced espresso is fabulous. \n\nI noticed the person next to me had a huge plate of goodness: Potatoes, meat, over medium eggs, guacamole, sour cream, tortillas... I knew I had to have it. So I ordered the Bunny Rancheros... and I haven't looked back since. \n\nThe guac is fresh, the chorizo has a complex depth of flavor, the over-medium eggs are cooked to perfection, and they even have the best hot sauce in the world already on the table: Texas Pete. \n\nSo, here are some things that would usually bother me if I was in a terrible mood. The parking is scarce- in fact, I just turned around to make sure they weren't towing my car because of my awkward parking space. It's busy and it's loud- so if you're trying to have a quiet, intimate conversation, this isn't the place.\n\nThe service does take a while, which would usually bother me, but each bite made up for each minute I waited. I also rarely ever spend a good $12 on a coffee and breakfast--I author the website BROKE & Healthy--but trust me when I say that it's worth your money. \n\nIn my opinion, Zada Jane's has lived up to the hype.",4
"Terrible all around. I love native New Yorker. I figured they were all the same. Boy was I wrong. We came to watch the World Cup and eat some wings/drink a few drinks. After arriving we were not super hungry yet, and with it being 110 degrees outside all we wanted was water. We sat down ordered a couple waters for the time being and planned to order food/drinks after cooling down a bit.  Instantly the waitress asked for both ID's (which I could understand since we were in the bar area) and then immediately said she needed a debit card. I asked why, considering we had only ordered water, and her reply was that she needed it cause people run out on their tab consistently and that they were understaffed so they wouldn't be able to watch us well. The main problem I had with this is that we hadn't even ordered anything yet! It made us feel very alienated and like criminals for just sitting down. I have never been treated this way in a restaurant. Needless to say I will never return to this location. Management needs to understand this is not how you treat customers. The location I usually go to we typically spend around $100 between 3 or 4 ppl during World Cup games and we always make it a point to overtip the wait staff. I ordered one beer here and that's it. I probably would have ordered more but the waitress seemed to be ignoring us probably for the fact that we originally ordered just water and she assumed we weren't going to order anything else. Again, I love Native New Yorker, but this place needs to get there stuff together. Hire more staff rather than making customers feel like criminals!",0
We went here for Pride after party. Nice ambience. It's outside and you could see the Mirage hotel from where you are. The path to get there is also cool because it's like you're going to a desert place in the jungle. \nMusic could have been better but I'm not sure if that was their fault. There was something that stunk on the dance floor. Smells like sewer.,2
I was excited to go since I love the Asheville store but just did not have the same eclectic feel. Which I really wouldn't have thought too much about if the food was great. But it wasn't. I ordered a basic breakfast since I wasn't too hungry but just got a plate of sodium. I ordered eggs with bacon and grits. Instead I got potatoes which was ok but then the potatoes were very salty. Then my eggs were very salty and had equal amounts of black pepper. Plus bacon is salty. So I think I met my max of salt for the week. I'll go back back it won't be my go-to.,1
Food not so good (frozen salad last time I went) unless it's fried... the fried mac and cheese is amazing.\n\nDrinks are crazy expensive.\n\nI think they hire dancers to get people out on the dancefloor- but it doesn't make sense to me since they are 100% better than most dancers so people just watch instead of joining in.  Weird atmosphere some nights.,2
Great service. The server was pleasant and courteous. Delicious! Nice clean location in centennial hills.,4
I was in town for a conference and found this place on Yelp. Great pour of Steelhead Pinot and awesome crab cakes! Be sure to check for the 10% coupon.,3
"well gabi you said it they are SLOW and i don't think the sandwiches are that great plus all the employs seam to have this attitude that your taking up there time like they have something else to do there product selection of Italian goodies seems pretty good but way over priced the one thing they have that i really like is there feta cheese which i use in my spanokopita the other day when i stopped in for feta i decided to get a sandwich... meatball,I said to the guy can i get an xtra meatball on the sandwich .......guy.....snotty....you can get whatever u want ,oh OK f u then i went to the front counter i told the guy there i would like a pound of feta he kinda shook his head in disgust i guess because there were 5 people behind me waiting to order food to go and i had the gull to order feta so he yelled behind the window CAN SOMEBODY GET ME A LB OF FETA FOR THIS GUY OUT HERE .......f u.......I will think twice before i give this establishment any money again",1
"This place has high highs, and low lows as far as our stay went. Here is the good, the bad, and the ugly. \n\nThe good: You walk out the door and you are up close and personal with the Siren's cove. Guests get front row priority for their show. Its close to everything. I liked the casino and the hurricane bar. The buffet is probably the best I have been to. We sat next to the dessert kitchen. Watching the chefs at work was just awesome. \n\nThe bad: When we arrived, they were over booked even though I'd called earlier in the day to let them know what time I'd be getting there to check in to guarantee that they would have my room. So much for that. They shuttled us over to the Trump and gave us a free stay. The Trump was amazing.  \n\nThe room was kind of small or seemed that way because the furniture seemed to over power it.\n\nThe ugly: Because our first night got comp'd because they didn't have a room, they refunded me my first nights deposit and charged me for the second night, which I thought was stupid because they should have just applied what I'd already paid for the second night. I booked a second room for our friends. My friend payed in cash for the second night. I should have been returned both my deposit and his, since it was all on my card and he paid cash for the second night. When we got home, I waited the standard 5 business days to see everything post to my bank account. The didn't refund me enough money. It took two weeks and 10 emails arguing with the manager, who was never there when I called, to get them to refund the right amount of money. \n\nIts a good place with great discounts... as long as you don't have to make any changes to how you are being charged. They were a nightmare to deal with.",2
Horrible hotel !!!  Just checked in for 8 days and i want to leave already.   Check in staff was rude and acted like me asking questions was putting her out.   Only reason i returned to this rundown hotel was because it is the ONLY hotel with balconies ... came up to our room only to find out that they have been shut down by screwing them shut !!!  Called the front desk who advised that they don't have to update anything that has been done to the hotel !!!  Not to mention that this hotel had been under construction for over the years and you would never be able to tell ... it's still a shit hole.   Spend your money elsewhere ... this place should be SHUT DOWN !!!,0
"Les 3 Brasseurs is a pretty average restaurant.  The food's alright, the service is alright, the beer's alright, the atmosphere is alright (as long as you don't mind the really loud volume).  It's too expensive and well-known for what it is, but I wouldn't call it bad.",1
"My husband and I felt like some of the famous spagetti that we so enjoyed at the Beverly Hills(Montage) Scarpetta. What a bummer. Our service was extremely slow and just lacking in every way. It was still early by Vegas standards (730) so I don't really get the lack of attentiveness. We ordered wine which did not come until AFTER our first course. Finally our spagetti comes....oh, so SALTY...it tasted nothing like the last time. Our server must have known something was amiss as he never once asked how we were enjoying our meal. We also waited a good 45 minutes to be offered dessert---or the check by this time. We finally had to wave someone down to get the bill since we were DONE with this place.\n\nSuch a shame. We have had many great food adventures in Vegas, this evening was not one of them. If you really want to have some spagetti that will change your life then come out out to California and enjoy the Scarpetta at the Montage.",2
"This is the original Bojangles, but they have many locations around town.  Bojangles is Charlotte's rip-off of Popeye's, and it's delicious.  They have great deals on chicken dinners, and tender chicken supremes.  The macaroni and cheese and the seasoned fries are the best side items on the menu.  The biscuits are out of this world, and you usually get a hot one.  If you are feeling decadent I recommend the sweet potato pie or the bo'berry biscuits.  The only reason I give this place 4 stars is that it is a fast-food restaurant, so the service is spotty- make sure to check that you got everything you ordered.",3
Spoke to Steve on the phone while I was in Hawaii.  Gave me a quote over the phone for my daughter's vehicle in LV.  She took the vehilce the next day to get it tinted and she is very happy.  My son who was up their with her confirmed that service is great and the work done was awesome.,3
"I'm back bitches!  \n\nUnfortunately, the review that I chose my return on isn't a glowing five star, but a glowering 1 star.\n\nThe only meal I ate in Vegas for 3 days ( I kid you not) was Friday not at this place.  It came highly recommended by numerous friends, so I thought this should be some great sushi.  \n\nBoy was I mistaken. \n\nFirstly, we had a 10PM reservation.  We arrived at 9:45 thinking we'll grab a seat at the bar and sip on a cocktail and people watch at all the bachelorette parties, etc.  Well, 45 mins later and we still didn't have a table.  My stomach was growling, and my face was scowling at this point.  \n\nThe hostess was rude when we would ask how much longer for a table, she would just say, You're next.  Really? I'm next you said that 10 people ago??!!\n\nWhen we finally got our seats, we ordered the following:\n\n--Rock shrimp:  It was tempura battered.  The first few bites were good, but as everything began to cool, it just became mushy.  \n\n--Fusion sushi roll was boring, bland and well, you get the point\n\n--The only thing that was excellent was the sea bass. It was moist, delicate and absolutely delicious.  But, $25 for 2 skewers left me wanting.  \n\nThe peruvian corn was awful..\n\nThe restaurant itself is everything that you would expect from Vegas. Upscale, trendy and expensive.  $200 for three items and 4 cocktails.  Not worth my only eating experience in Vegas that weekend.",0
"This review is in no way meant to be racial. Its just something that annoys me and I'm sure many others.\n\nMy wife is philipino and comes here for her hair cut because no one else can so she says. When you get here you do not hear one word of English and they cannot speak English. I find that to be rude because they could be saying bad things and its just rude in general.\n\nThe place itself is fair priced and they do their job. But , if you are not Vietnamese and can't speak the language and get annoyed about hearing it over and over. Do not come here. \n\nWhen I come with my wife I bring Bose qc15 noise canceling headphones, because I might get violent. That's how annoying it is.",1
"Hood RICH for $99 bucks.  HOOD RICH.  \n\nFirst mistake-assuming the hotel  would genuinely honor and reserve 2 beds. WRONG.  1 kid and thank heavens for the sofa bed. \n\nSecond mistake-looking at pictures and thinking it was a Vegas hotel.  It's not a Vegas hotel. There is no casino, no nightlife. It's 2-3 blocks from the strip and it's like any comfort suite with a kitchen.\n\n\nWith that being said...why am I giving it 3 stars?  \n++It was $99 dollars a night...split that among a group of 4....and it's SAVINGS.\n \n++It had a spacious kitchen with plates, glasses, and utensils.\nAppliances included in the room: microwave and refrigerator.  The kitchen counter was a great place to apply makeup! \n\n++The bathroom was spacious, and did I mention the huge whirpool tub?  Too bad I forgot my epson salt!\n\n\n++While it's off the strip, there is a gas station and 7-11 within walking distance. YES-SKETCHY...but if you have the  munchies for a morning burrito, Cheetos, and chasers to go with your GG like a slurpee...it's like GOLD.  \n\nUnder the circumstances, the staff was pretty friendly, and at one point even provided a ride to another hotel.  For what it's worth...I would stay here with 4 people.  It''s BUDGET FRIENDLY and a 10 dollar cab ride from airport. Who spends more than 4 hours a night in a hotel room anyway?\n\nThey must be doing something right. We were on the 17th floor and the hotel was at capacity.",2
"The food is hand crafted and all good but in the end I left underwhelmed.\n\nThe appetizers are small so two people might try two. (think piece of toast size)\n\nWe tried the fennel orange salad with shrimp ($13)  and the cheese plate ($6) . The cheese plate was a high quality peppered eating cheese with what I think was Italian Imported Cherries and Marcona Almonds, bread was not included with the cheese plate so we ordered bread ($2) . The shrimp were well prepared and flavorful however the fennel salad was fresh but very bland and lacked the taste of fennel but did present  well with the use of blood oranges. \n\nThree tiny fried sage leaves adorned the 9 small butternut squash raviolis and they were in a browned butter ($14) . The raviolis were seasoned nice and prepared al dente . Potato gnocchi were very light and garnished with a small amount of the famous mozzarella ($15) Two regular size meatballs were added ($6) ((ouch!)) The meatballs were good but ..........\n\nI can't say anything was wrong with the food it was all good but left feeling like something was missing.\n\nCommunity tables are by the wall. One couple was at one and then another couple with two toddlers joined them.",2
FYI Southwest Airlines won't let you print out your borading pass on your return flight until you arrive at the departing airport. Absolutely makes no sense....Will be using another airline for my travels.,0
Quick shitty pizza found in malls and airports.. though big slices and decent prices.,1
"Sushi samba is a great place to have an afternoon drink amidst hang overs from Friday and Saturday night in vegas.  I came here on a Sunday afternoon and ordered the speciality cocktail - samba juice - and the El Topo roll as a snack!\n\nThe el tapo roll is the perfect mix between brazilian and Japanese cuisine, and it tasted great with my fruity drink!  It was a bit crunchy with cheese sprinkled on top, definitely something you will not find at a traditional pure Japanese resturant.  \n\nI would come here again for a full meal - but of course, like any other Las Vegas restaurant, the price is a bit over the top.  But what else can you expect from an Asian Fusion restaurant?",3
"Perfect, vegan/vegetarian prayers answered. I have been here 3 times now and the food has been on point. Good prices and great portions, friendly customer service and they even remembered me. Their breakfast burrito with the tofu scramble is by far the best breakfast burrito I have ever had, place is very charming and makes you feel like you are at a friends house for breakfast. I'm picky and I can not think of one flaw to this place. Highly recommend!",4
"As a business traveler to find an eatery where you can walk in alone, feel comfortable, have great food and drink and excellent service in a casual pub like  atmosphere is rare.  This place has it all.  Wish we had one in NY.  Will come back again and again.",3
"I was unaware of the existence of Ross until I moved to Vegas. It was while shopping at Target that I noticed the store just down the way. I figured I would pop by and see what they had to offer. Boy, was I in for a surprise! I now visit Ross on a weekly basis, searching for good buys. \n\nThe store is iffy on cleanliness. I think it depends on the time of day you go. I've seen it in shambles with merchandise everywhere and I've seen it relatively clean and organized. The employees aren't enthusiastic by any means, but they will help if asked. \n\nThe main reason I shop here, though, is for the deals. They have tons of linens, clothes, shoes, and home decor for great prices. I dare say 90% of my home decor is from Ross. \n\nIt's hit or miss as far as finding what you're looking for. If you're just in to browse though, you'll more than likely walk out with something.",3
"I have had this on my radar ever since I heard they did the in house pulling noodles.  Unfortunately we have a late eating schedule and never quite made it in time.  I saw a friends post that they no longer do the show but still decided to give it a try.  \n\nWe were happily surprised to get there in time for food!  The service was awesome, the girls did not make us feel rushed even though we were cutting it close to closing time in fact a couple came in after us.  I had a few things in mind from reading prior reviews but asked the waitress for her favorites she obliged.  We had the Pork Wonton in Red Chili Oil on recommendation from other reviewers, great flavor but a bit oily.  Sliced Pork & Mushroom with Noodle  and good smooth almost creamy flavor (but no cream) the mushrooms were amazing I probably could have eaten a whole bowl of them with the noodles.  Lan Zhou Beef Noodle Soup the broth nice and flavorful with a bit of zip from the basil and chives.  All and all the flavors were good and the service was great, the price was great as well.\n\nSo no more noodle shows make me sad but I would rather pay for good noodles then a show any day.  These noodles were not to salty as others are and they were the perfect combination of firm but not too firm, noodle fans will understand.  My boyfriend is a rice and noodle snob so if they suck trust me I hear about it!  (however he still says my rice is still the best!  (Not bad for a white girl immersed in an Asian culture)  \n\nI will gladly go here then the strip for better noodles, great broth/sauce, great service and a lower price for these better options.  I hope they will revisit the noodle show option I would love to see it and I am sure many more people would schedule a visit accordingly if they set a time for one once a night or so.",3
"Awful dry cleaners.\n\nIf you use them, be sure to count every item going in and every item coming back out. Expect  to be occasionally missing items.\n\nYou will get items back with stains or smells that they did not have when going in, and if you question any of it, you'll get told it was your fault.\n\nAlso, if the ticket says \""ready by 5\"" and you show up at 5:30, don't expect your clothes to be there.\n\nStay away!",0
"I'm just back from my 1st trip to SBG and I have to say I'm impressed.  A word of warning tho, it's not really all that Mexican.  It's more South West which is fine with me.  There are plenty of good Mexican places but finding a good SW restuarant in Phx can be a challenge.  We started with the Green Chile Tamale appetizer which was topped with chunks of seasoned roast pork and fresh salsa.  For an entree' I had the Pan Seared Red Trout which was served on a bed of green beans with fresh spinach, and fire roasted tomatos & peppers.  The it was all covered with some magical sauce that makes it all come alive in your mouth.  My companion had the North Central Chicken which had a glaze that's very close to a molle' and served with mashed potatos and asparagras.  We topped it off with Butter Milk Pie which takes sweet to a whole new level.\nAll this and 2 drinks for less than $60 and excellent service.  Let me be clear, there's nothing here that really wows me, but it's a big step up from every Mexican/SW chain in town.  We'll be back!",3
"A nice, comfortable, though a bit dated hotel with great location for scenic boat rides, walking, biking, boat rides, dining. shopping, sporting events...!  \n\nDETAILS: \nOur standard room is simply furnished with 2 full beds, coffee maker, iron/board. There is no safe, nor cooler, however. The room is quite comfortable and has free wifi access. Our window has a partial view of the river. The bathroom is small, though adequate. Wish it had a shower stall instead of a bathrub. The place is a bit old and needs better upkeep. The hotel does have a  nice pool and a fitness room. It also provides free shuttle service to anywhere within 3miles! Oh, yes, FREE morning coffee in the lobby, also. \n\nOne can park on hotel's own lot or in the parking structure across the hotel, for $18/day (overnight, no in-and-out privilege) or $20/day with privilege. \n\nThe Station Square is a large complex of shops, eateries, full of interesting and education historical artifacts, working rails for freight trains; docking for boat rides, hiking/biking paths along the river. The scenery of the river, bridges, stadiums, and the mountains is truly spectacular! In the evening, around 9:30 pm (?), there is even a firework display by the 3-river stadium. By the way, the famed Gandy Dancer Restaurant is nearby, also, among several other fine eateries! \n\nOUR EXPERIENCE\nMy wife and I enjoyed our nice long walk along the shoreline, ventured out to the downtown area (on the other side of the bridge) and back.  To our surprise, by 7:30pm, most businesses in downtown were closed, including restaurant! We only saw one small bar open! However, not to worry, most restaurants and bars in the Station Square are open late into the night.\nWe stopped by Bar Louis and enjoyed our beers and bar food in its charming patio with a spectacular view of the river, bridges, boats, watching freight trains go by...and the beautiful firework!\n\nThis is a nice place for a romantic getaway, family vacation, or business trip. The room price is reasonable, especially if you can get it through price line, hotwire, etc.",3
"This is the Subway of \""Mexican\"" food. I emphasize the \""  \"" since this is a American interpretation. It is also pretty consistent at this branch with being fresh tasting, aside from one time we came right before closing and the meats were a bit dried out. One thing to improve on, like Connie R. said, is cleaning the tables. Sometimes we have to flag down someone to wipe it down. \n\nIt is seemingly healthy, and in some ways it is with naturally raised grilled meats and fresh prepared rice, beans, salsas, veggies, etc. It tastes fresh and simple so it gives the impression it is all good and fine. I thought that too and didn't really put much stock in it other than the taste. I thought it probably had a lot of calories simply because of the size, that can be two meals for a lot of people, but didn't think much of its nutrition other than that. I thought, this is a great alternative to the usual fast foods. \n\nHowever, I recently found out that this was owned by McDonalds (they were the ones that expanded the brand until 2006 when McD sold). They first to start the pre-prepped food that is high in sodium, preservatives and fat to equal +cheap food with higher profit margins trend. That got me to do a lot of digging...I dont ever trust that fucking clown. Though the meat is natural and salsas and guacamole is freshly prepared somehow McDonalds has managed to mess up the fresh ideal by putting a fuckton of sodium in the food. Why? I don't know, if food is fresh, why do you need it? I swear, somewhere out there I think McDonalds is secretly funding research on artificial transplant organs, owns part stake in Plavix, Jenny Craig, and Freestyle diabetic meters to maximize their profit in a product progression cycle. \n\nI like a Bol with Carnitas, rice, black beans, tomato, corn, a little green salsa, cheese, sour cream and lettuce. Big ass bowl doesnt sound too bad at 780 calories but apparently it also has Fat 32G (49% daily value), Saturated Fat 15G (75% ), Cholesterol 140mg (47%) , sodium 2310mg (96%), carbs 71g( 24%), dietary fiber 15g (60%), sugars 13g, protein 51g \n\nReal fresh food doesn't need it. That much sodium is enough to give someone hypertension even though they are eating Chipotle, which is supposed to be \""healthy\"". If I add guacamole and chips, which we sometimes do, I'm at 2940mg, 122% of daily intake. I have a fairly fragile health system so I have to watch out for things like these and I'm sure I'm not the only person who needs to know these things.  Everything else is fairly high, but that is a reflection in portion size. If you count that bowl as two proper servings then the calories,  the fat, proteins, fibers, etc. is very fair of a serving as per meal. Still, MSNBC Health placed the burritos on their list of the \""20 Worst Foods in America\"" because of their high caloric content and high sodium. \n\nHey, if I'm going to do fast foods on occasion it will probably be a \""better\"" choice like Chipotle that actually taste pretty good and is hormone free, but just saying- though it is fresh and natural, it is not as healthy as it is marketed and perceived by the public to be.",2
The hotel was very clean and great service! The housekeeping was extremely attentive. It wasnt even that expensive. Loved the goose down comforter. I did not want to get out of my bed during my vacation =) I will be staying at MGM again!! MOST DEFINITELY,3
"A couple close friends were in town and we decided to try this place out. We got sassy cow cheese curds to share and it was def one of the best I had. Very stringing, right amt if grease and loving that texture. I don't even need any dipping sauce to go with it. I had the lands and sea which consisted of a 5oz filet and 3 scallops with mash and daily vegetable. I thought the filet was on the salty side and the medium looked more like well done.. Little disappointed until I tried the scallops which was surprisingly phenomenal! Super well seasoned to bring out the taste. It's tough to cook scallops since they are pretty bland. The sides are alright..nothing spectacular. I also had a strawberry mojito which was pretty yummy. My highlight of the meal was definitely the curds and the scallops. \n\nSo why is this a 3 star? We were there on a Friday night and the band was playing.. Do they have live music every weekend? They might want to do a little better search next time when it comes to live music. The band that was playing was just terrible! Songs were out of tune and the lead singer was basically yelling his lungs out. Like a couple other ppl mentioned.. The service needs a little work. Our waiter basically asked whether we were done while my friend was still chowing down her food.. After we said that we are still working it, he followed to give us our check 5 minutes later. It was 9pm and after the dinner rush...so that was a downer.",2
"I give it three stars only because I have been such a fan of this place in the past. In fact, last time I was there I came back bragging to all of my friends that I had found the best steak in the world. This time, not so much... Or at least it wasn't $65 worth. \n\nFirst off, when we ordered drinks at the bar, the cocktail waitress really didn't know what they had for scotch or rum, then she took 30 minutes to bring us our drinks.  \n\nI already mentioned the steak, which was a big let down.  Then, I requested that the waiter ask the chef to grill my asparagus, the waiter said, \""no problem, we can cook it however you like.\""  But when he brought them out, they were not grilled so he went back for more... When he came back out he served them to me steamed al dente. He said that, \""apparently this was just too difficult for the chef.\""\n\nI don't mean to be picky but at these prices, I think that is my right. I like my pasta al dente and my asparagus char broiled.",2
We went in last night for a friends Birthday. We Drove up form California  because that's what He wanted. Well it was not what I expeated for a Gordon Ramsay restraint's. The services was great. They had our food there on time and it was hot and some what good. I order the  Blue burger and some type of garlic fries. the burger was ok but the Fries did not sit well with me and I got sick when I get home. Not a fun time at all.They were very greasy and if I'm right when I see him on TV he would of yelled at someone and then throw them back and say FIX IT!!! Well I throw them all right. UP!! not a fan at all.\n\nThen when we told the waiter it was our friends Birthday does he get a something. he then side it someone it going to pay for it under his breath. We just looked at him and left. We paid $430.00 for 13 of us and that is what he has to say. NOT cool!  I wish I got his name. \n\nI will give a big shout out to the people who brought our Food. They were great! :) Knew who order what and told us what we order. and they had a smile at all time.\nGreat team work there.,0
Love this place. I have been going  here for years and it is consistently great. Sit at the bar for best service.  Talk to Tyrone he is awesome.,3
I went here for lunch and enjoyed my meal.\n\nThe meatball sandwich had lots of tasty meatballs and a nice tomato sauce.  The sweet potato fries were very good as well.\n\nThis is a convenient place for lunch if you are in the Airpark.\n\nI'll have to give them a try for happy hour in the future.,2
"3.5 stars. We stopped in on a Sunday afternoon for a late lunch and we were seated right away. The menu has all the items you expect in a Japanese restaurant  - sushi, hibachi, teriyaki, etc.  The decor is nice and modern and the service is attentive. I ordered the 10 piece sashimi lunch and an eel and avocado roll.  My hubby got the vegetable teriyaki bento box. My plate had 9 pieces of sashimi and one piece of a decorative crab stick - kinda of bummer when the menu said 10 pieces of sashimi. Other than that - we enjoyed our lunch and we'll be back.",2
"I hate doing this, but after Pita Jungle being one of my favorite restaurants in the Valley for years, I think I'm giving up on them. \n\nLet me preface this review by saying that I've likely been to this Pita Jungle about 50 times over the course of three years or so.  At one point I was going once a week because it's near my office and has a great selection of vegetarian items. I love the lentil fatoush salad, the cilantro hummus, the soups....and that CAULIFLOWER! But the inconsistency as of late has brought me to this 3-star review today.\n\nToday we ordered take-out from the office at 12:40 using their online ordering system. The system told me it would be ready at 1:15 at the latest. I arrived at 1:15 to pick up my 2 items (one of which was tabouleh - come on!) and they weren't ready. I waited another 10 minutes and finally said something to the gal and she went to the kitchen to retrieve my order. No apology, nothing. Just, \""Here. Do you need any napkins or utensils?\"" \n\nI got back to the office and couldn't wait to tear into my tabouleh salad, which comes with hummus and pita. What I found was a giant container of hummus with a scoop of tabouleh on top. Really? I thought it was supposed to be the other way around? So I unwrap my COLD pitas (which are usually toasty and warm) and started dipping into my hummus salad. Now I feel gross, because I just basically ate a plate of hummus for lunch.\n\nThe food and service use to be so consistent, but recently the food is practically a 50/50 gamble. And the service even more so. The manager (I'm guessing since he was the only one in a dress shirt and pants) was behind the counter when I was paying and didn't even make eye contact with me let alone greet me. I've seen him there MANY times and I would have thought he'd recognize me by now.\n\nI feel like each time I go i get a different version of my favorite dishes. Lentil fatoush used to be my fave and the last five times I have told myself that the recipe I make it home is better. And it's not $10 when I make it at home. \n\nSorry PJ, but I think I'm breaking up with you. *sigh*",2
"Bayside Buffet is what America is all about - the bland, mediocre food, and lots of it.  This might be great if you have a tapeworm, but there isn't much on this buffet that is remotely edible.  Even worse, the confusing layout and slow moving lines will leave you annoyed and frustrated.  But the worst part about this restaurant is that there are no bathrooms inside.  You have to leave the restaurant and enter the casino to go into the bathroom.  I don't know why this is?  Perhaps they are afraid guests will go to the bathroom to purge in order to \""get their money's worth.\""  Regardless, in a restaurant where you spend more of your time wandering aimlessly and waiting in line to find out whether that hot plate is filled with crab legs or chicken fingers, you'd hope they'd at least have a convenient bathroom available.  Save your time and money and eat somewhere that brings the food to you.",0
A good place to stop by quickly. Coming here you need to know what to buy so you can be in and out of here. Location is terrible. \n\nI've come here numerous times and walk in and find the staff on their phone doing nothing. Last visit a young lady was on her phone at the register texting away and briefly acknowledged me without taking her eyes off her phone. Uhh..... Nice customer service skills. \n\nThere is a one guy that works here (can't remember his name) that always helps me and is very efficient. I was pretty indecisive about items located at the very top self which needed a ladder to get and he was nice enough to stay on that ladder as long as I needed him too. \n\nI hardly ever go to Big 5. This one is the closest to my home so I've come here the most but I have had better service at the other locations.,1
"I stumbled upon this place after eating elsewhere, but luckily had the 24 hour buffet pass and decided to feast again. After waiting in line with many people possibly over 350 pounds (I'll be there someday), I was told I needed to pay an additional $15 to enter!\n\nThe oysters on the half tasted disgusting. The only acceptable seafood was the crab legs and the mussels, which are cheap anyways.\n\nI was infuriated by the extra cost of this buffet considering the lack of overall quality of the seafood items. The waitress also told me that I looked about 16 and took my ID into the light to examine it. How rude.\n\nI heard full retail price is $50 which is completely ridiculous. I was so stuffed after this buffet I tried to vomit in their bathroom with no success. I had to take a taxi back to my hotel because I couldn't walk on two legs.",1
"By far the best hotel I've ever stayed at.  Upscale, very clean and classy  all around.  The rooms are huge and are very nicely decorated.  Both rooms we stayed at had  HUGE windows which provided amazing views.  The restrooms are probably as big as a bedroom and included a hot tub.  Bathrobes and slippers were provided. The buffet at \""THE BUFFET\"" was exceptional.  Club XS, one of Vegas' hottest nightclubs,  happens to be within the Wynn and club Tryst is right next door a few slot machines away at Encore.   Recovering from a night of partying the next day at the pool with drinks was the best. For the ladies, Fashion Mall is right across the street. I would definately spend another weekend here.  Totally worth shelling the extra $$$.  Wynn-ing!!!",4
"Relative to surrounding resort hotels, Excalibur is square in the middle. It's not decrepit, but there's nothing exceptional about it. \n\nThere's the usual array of slot machines, table games, and drink options. The presentation of everything everywhere, however, has the consistency of flat soda. Excalibur IS a hotel, is a casino, has an alright pool area, has some restaurants, but everything feels old, tired. Cheap.\n\nThe theme itself never makes sense. Paris has croissants and coffee. The Venetian has exceptional Italian dining, gelato, street mimes, and a gondola! So come on Excalibur, where are the giant roast turkey legs? Where are the fair maidens in bustiers? How about some ponies, or court jesters?  Excalibur has none of that, though it should. There's no wifi in the hotel rooms, which is about as authentic to the period theme as things get here.\n\nStill, 3-stars it deserves. Staff were very good to me at check-in, helping me situate my room and the rest of our party in relative proximity to one another. The gym is clean and overlooks the pool, so you can ogle while being ogled. The casino stays pretty active up until around 3am'ish even on weeknights. \n\nThis place is probably fine for families on a budget with low expectations. You will not be wow'ed here, though.",2
"Wow is all I can say! The buffet was very limited and seemed empty for most of the part. In addition, the food was luke warm/cold. The hot and sour soup I thought would be good but was watered down, and lacked flavor. The waitress was kind though and provided us drinks and cleared our table in a timely manner. Just wish the experience was better. I guess if you eat cheap food you get cheap quality food!",0
"Stunning!!!  \n\n7 course meal!  \nItalian Truffles!  \nSunchokes!\n\nFresh dessert cook in a small organic pumpkin.  Loved it!!!!   \n\nDidn't do any research and brought my 2 years old which was a bad idea, but the staff was cordial and accommodating.\n\nThank you.  I will be back, but I will leave my child at home this time.",4
"Not sure why the bad reviews here. I always make appointments for my oil changes and they are usually done within an hour. I walk over somewhere and have lunch, when I return it is done. One time they didn't get it done during the hour and the oil change was free!!! I have found that they are honest. And with a car shop, that means something. They don't sell me a new air filter EVERY time! I had the dealer tell me the battery was bad on my Toyota, so I took it by this Fletchers and they tested it. It was fine. The dealership used the wrong setting. The battery lasted another 18 months before I replaced it. I have never been sold something I didn't need at this Fletchers location and I have been going here for over 10 years now with 2 cars. And I could go on and on about how much money they have saved me from what the Dealer 'recommended' that didnt need to be done. I take it to Fletchers and ask them to check it out and 9 times out of 10, it is fine. \nI have had bad experiences at other Fletchers, but not this one. They have always treated me fairly and have been honest. The guys working the desk aren't always the most personable, but I have yet to feel like I am getting ripped off like so many other car places. Good work and honest...that is what I look for in a auto shop and this Fletchers provides that! The only reason I didnt give 5 stars is the fact that it takes a week to get an appointment because they are always busy...and what I mentioned about the front desk.",3
"I just started attending the Arizona International Buddhist Meditation Center after a friend recommended I come with him. Meetings are Wednesday nights at 7pm on Temple Street (the center may be difficult to find as it is located in a residential house). There is parking available in front the house as well as a church parking lot across the street. \n\nCushions are provided for your comfort and the meditation session lasts about 45 minutes. Shane will ring a bell and talk you through the first 5 to 10 minutes. Afterwards, silence commences and you try not to think of anything at all. Once the meditation session ends, Shane leads a short discussion session to allow for questions and for the resident monk to read a prayer aloud.\n\nI feel relaxed and at peace when I come here. Everyone is kind and welcoming, no judgement! If you are looking for a group environment and friendly community to meditate with, this is the perfect spot in Arizona!",3
"The only thing good here is the overpriced baked goods that they get from someplace else. The wanna-be pretentious staff are extremely rude (we stayed long enough to see 3 different rude employees) and it isn't even a TRUE coffee shop. A TRUE coffee shop has the following: good aura (its small, smells weird in the back, and doesn't have enough seats, the only table that is comfortable is reserved for huge groups), lets you sit and study once you buy a drink (all they care about is getting your money, they don't want you to sit and enjoy the environment, they just want you to buy coffee and leave, they are not welcoming to those costumers that stay), and friendly staff (nope). Go someplace better! Barriques, Michealangelos, and Fair Trade Coffee! Trust me! Don't be Fooled by Mother Fool's \""hipster\"" appeal. Tis nothing but sick, overpriced coffee and snobs in a smelly room. Word of advice Mother Fools: Make your employees shower, improve your atrocious coffee, and move out the the welcoming Willy Street environment where you do NOT fit in.",0
"We came in for breakfast as the sun was coming up from a hard night of karaoke and booze at Hot Shots. The service was very nice and the food was fresh. I wish they had a late night special, but my friend paid for breakfast so I can't really complain. I got the corned beef hash plate. canned corned beef, but when drunk it is SUBLIME! crispy hash browns and so on. Solid diner food at the right time of day. AAAAAAND you can smoke in the dining room!",3
"During my last trip to Montreal (October 2007), I stayed at this hotel located to downtown Montreal's cultural core.  Unlike other hotels in the area, the La Tour Centre Ville hotel is definitely a good value for your budget, however, it really is outdated when it comes to many modern day services found in hotels found elsewhere in the area. First of all, it's definitely a hike to Montreal's Village and nightclub area (Rue St. Catherine Est). Second, the hotel seems to have last been remodeled when Rene Levesque was Premier, which truly is sad seeing that Montreal is a first class tourist destination. The hotel has an eerie empty ambiance most of the time I was there, although hotel staff were very helpful and good. If distance to the area's hotspots, price, and decor is not a problem for you, then you found the right spot. Otherwise, I rather stay at the Hilton or the Gouverneur Hotel.",1
Ugh! No A/C in this place!!! Never again coming back but their spicy duck was delicious.,0
"Good food, clean, with a friendly helpful staff.  Price seems a little high for the caliber of food.  Would give it 3.5 stars.",2
"My therapist Geriann was amazing!  Perfect pressure where needed very professional and attentive to my needs. I felt like I was on a cloud of air when she was done with our session. I felt so relieved of stress and anxiety, I had no doubt I would want to return, and often!    Unfortunately my blissful experience was destroyed the second I entered the reception lobby to pay and reschedule. I was hounded relentlessly about the skincare products available for purchase and their benefits by one of the aestheticians that was also in the lobby. I thanked her several times and she just would not stop going on and on. My anxiety was rising and the massage efforts were fading. When I finally explained to her I was simply not interested she left the lobby allowing me to finally pay. The receptionists did not have change, although it was 11:00 in the afternoon so I had to wait for someone to go to the bank to get change. This took over 20 minutes running me so late into my day that I had to cancel another service at my regular salon. My spa day pretty much ended up in over marketing, stress, and rescheduling of other appointments in my day. Dont have any ENVY",1
"Dined at RL on Saturday night with the girls (wife, daughter, and M in Law).  Surprised to see how busy it was for a Saturday @ 6 but that's the crowd they draw.  Waited the quoted 20-25 and got seated and greetd by our \""Seafood Expert\"" Tim.  Ordered the Shrimp Trio and got what I expected. M in Law not too happy with her fried shrimp size, but matches the price I quess.  Very accomodating in getting the \""Seafood Hater' daughter a plate of linguini with butter.  Wifey had the Cedar Salmon grilled on a plank, very happy.  Drinks were cold, cheddar bisquits were abundant....overall good time.",3
"If there was such a thing as zero stars- this place would be it! \n\nA friend a I went for Restaurant week and the food was nothing to ever go back to. We had the crab \""cakes\"" which I am surprised they can even get away with calling it that- more like fried crab and mayonnaise balls. \n\nThen, we had both had a Chili and Coffee rubbed Scallops. They cut the scallops in half to make it look like more, dunked them in a oil bath and then poured coffee grinds and chili paste all over... mmm yummy!!! \n\nThe best part of the meal comes with the check: they neglected to tell us that after a month of being in business, they still have not connect their American Express machine. When we went to pay, the server said \""ohh we can't take that yet.\"" To which my friend and I argued that we should have been notified ahead of time, what if we have nothing else to pay with?? The conversation gets so ridiculous that the manager comes over and tells us it's not his fault and there is nothing he can do so I will have to pay for the entire meal with cash or another credit card. \""I told my servers to tell each table\"" he said. I'm pretty sure that's not a good enough explanation. \n\nI am sparing you tons of heated details... the bottom line is I give this place 5 months tops and it will be donzo!",0
"One of my favorite Thai restaurants.   The Tom Yum is really very authentic and I enjoy the gai gatiam pad thai or garlic chicken.    I have not been back since I turned vegetarian, but know I can get some excellent vegi dishes.   Service and take out is great.   Strongly recommend.",4
"My BF and I are looking for a sushi spot to eat cuz we are on this sushi kick and have been to 3 different places within a week.\n\nSo here we are, at Yama Sushi. We came here because of the reviews. Some are bad, but most are good to great. And what do I think? Well let me explain my rating process.\n\nPlace is definitely small. Chairs are brushed agains each other and people's backs. Elbow to elbow counter seating. 4 or some times 5 sushi chefs behind the sushi bar. I did liked the island beach back drop tho. 3 stars. \n\nService was good. Got our waters and orders fairly fast. Dirty dishes was taken right away. A lot of servers came and ask how we were doing and was able to order appetizers off of the AYCE menu quickly. So 5 stars for just services from our servers. But sushi chefs, I give 3 stars. No welcoming gestures, just heads down making sushi and when ordered they just gave a nod.\n\nOkay here's the real deal. If you are a foodie of sushi, like me, you will probably rate their food as 2 stars. Fish is definitely not extremelyfresh, and all the pieces where all pre-cut so that they could pump them out like a factory machine. We ordered the seafood salad. Seems like a they just put together all the pieces of sashimi fish that didn't make the cut, tossed with a pokie like sauce (no spicy, mild, or spicy) over cucumber and shredded Daikon. Not a fan of that. Order yellowtail and white tuna sushi. It was mushy. Rice is overly vinegary. It's seems like everything had a sour note to it. Soft shell crab was good, the breading was surprising crispy. So 2 stars for the food.\n\nSo, how do i feel? I didn't like that at all. It seems like they value quantity over quality. I don't know if I can even call those guys behind the sushi bar, chefs. They are just cooks that knows how to make those 20 or something rolls on the menu.\n\nAnd to be honest. I would pay almost double for food that can just blow my mind when it comes to sushi.",1
"There are two kinds of people in this world: Bread eaters and rice eaters.  I personally fall in the rice category and don't eat bread too often, but dear lord is there white chocolate bread GOOD.  I could seriously eat a whole loaf to myself- and nearly did in one day.  Don't leave Bon Breads without getting yourself a loaf!\n\nTip: This place is hard to find and is not visible from the street.  You should probably call if you get lost trying to look for this place.",3
"I've been coming here since my daughter was 6 months and I very much like this office.  Their clean, polite and have good customer service. The ONLY thing I do not like is that their not always on time with their appointments. Last Monday I came for my daughter's 11:15am appointment and I was not seen til 12:30p. Last ones to leave the ofc, I was so not pleased that day. \n\nOverall, I like this ofc they just need to speed up their waiting time.",3
"It's been a while since my visit here but i remember 3 things distinctly\n\n1.  The steak was kind of sub par for this type of restaurant\n2.   All the sides were good (and were served in All Clad cookware :P )\n3.  They charged us some kind of BS setup fee, I don't remember exactly what it was for... but i believe it amounted to us being charged ~100 bucks for them to put 2 tables together so our group can all sit together!",1
"So, I Had The Gyro I was Pretty good I had better & I had worst. The Pita Bread was soft they gave you a good amount of meat  the Tzatziki Sauce didn't have a lot of flavor kinda plan but once again I had worst. The atmosphere was nice only been open 3 days so It's still clean hope it stays that way. I will go back for sure",2
"Prices are good if you can find what you want. Some nights the place gets so emptied you wonder if the people ordering are sleeping. Also would recommend buying your produce elsewhere as you can often find rotten fruits and veggies mixed in with the \""good\"" stuff. But as I said the prices are lower then most anywhere in town.",2
Delicious large bagels and bialys that toast really well.  Great selection of sandwiches and homemade salads. Quick and very friendly service.,4
I just went to Fry's to purchase a TV stand. The service is horrible. I ended up purchasing one that the sales girl told me was very heavy as she pushed the cart up to me. She had one of her co-workers print a invoice so that the cashier would not have to take it from the cart cause of how heavy it was. I got no offers to help me get it into my car. I did see a young man carry a a bag out for someone while I was trying to get into my car I called out to him but he ignored me. Finally a nice young man offer to help me. I told him just put it back into the cart cause I was not going to give this company any of my money. Even the manager on duty did not even care when I returned it. They all need to go to customer service classes...,0
"We were there on 4-20 in the afternoon and 2 of us had the Seafood Rice soup. WTF???? How is is possible to make a soup so bland??? Did you break into a hospital & steal their soup recipes???? I haven't recently had surgery, I can handle spices... I swear!!!!  It wasn't just me, my cousin felt the same way. It was like cloudy water with 1 tiny shrimp and occasional carrots.\n\nI also had the half a sandwich of turkey which I think when I said hold the dressing also meant hold the turkey. It had all the fixings and 1 tiny piece of lonely turkey. I was sad to eat it because it looked so tiny and fragile. \n\nMy husband ordered the full sized turkey sandwich and wasn't quite sure what he got but he found it delicious enough not to say anything about it till after the meal.\n\nWe had the mussels and they were excellent with a superb taste (clearly not made by the person making hospital soup). Our server was also excellent, friendly, funny and on top of everything, so it was a bit confusing.",1
"I stalked Tops N Bottoms for months, waiting for it to open. I work nearby and was excited to have another option for when my froyo cravings kick in. \n\nThe shop is very clean and the girl that was working was friendly and helpful. I love how they have their frequent shopper programs et up, you don't need to keep track of a punch card, they use your phone number instead! \n\nOn to the important stuff!! There were around a dozen flavors to choose from, I loved both the cake batter and the double chocolate. The yogurt is the perfect creamy consistancy yogurt should be. And the toppings! I saw three different types of popping boba, as well as mochi. The fruit selection could be better, but they do have the standards.. Also various nuts, candies, cereal and so on. You can also get a waffle cup or cone if you prefer. \n\nA couple things prevent me from  giving Tops N Bottoms a 5 star review. One is the previously mentioned limited selection of fruit. The other is the lack of a website to see what flavors are currently available. Despite this, I think I have found my go-yo froyo place during the work week!!",3
"My review pertains to 808 Sushi's happy hour special (Fri and Sat 9pm-11pm. 50% off all cut rolls and appetizers and all beer! $1 hot sake!!)\n\nThis place makes it COMPLETELY possible to pop in for a correct sized portion of food that is so good it leaves you craving it long after you KNOW you have no more room in your tummy!\n\nWe always start off with the Poke appetizer $6.95 (or maybe it's $5.95)..EVERYTIME it has been to die for!  Granted I've never killed a fish and eaten it onsite, but this is as close as it will probably get for me!!\n\nNext one of us will pick a roll at random-there is a great selection..most range from $4-7..pair that up with a couple $1 sakes and a beer and our night is perfect!  We usually get outta there for under $20-stuffed, happy and tipsy..hehe\n\nMost recently we had the Maui Special roll..which is tempura shrimp, unagi, cream cheese, and cucumber drizzled with eel sauce.  I can't even express how delicious it was!!\n\nThe service is ALWAYS friendly and if you go often enough, they remember you!\n\n\nEr, in the past, we've done the All you can eat and that was delicious as well, but one doesn't always have the time/stomach space/cash for AYCE-so this happy hour special hits the spot!",4
"We have been to this place several times now. Each time the service has either been awesome (5 stars) or below mediocre (1 star), but the food is good! So average of 3 stars. If the food goes down hill, then this place will be a no go for us for sure.",2
"I loved Sandra! I brought in my dress to be altered in January for a December wedding. She had me go over what I wanted to change. I needed to add sleeves and bring up the back of my dress but I wanted it to look like it was all one dress and not just sleeves tacked on. Well, I ended up moving  my wedding date to April and she was so accommodating. Even with some miscommunication about the date she had my dress ready for pictures previous to the wedding and then I brought it back to her so she could bustle it. She took lace from the bottom of my dress and used that to continue the lace and beading of my bodice into a sleeve. It looks flawless. She also brought up the back with the same lace and I was able to keep my lace up back. I don't know how she did it but it was amazing! Also very affordable. Sandra will make you look fabulous!! She is great at understanding what you want and making it happen.",3
Let's just say I spent $160 on my ticket and it was worth no more than $75 at best.  I was expecting something amazing with how much I spent and instead I wish I would have gone to something else.  The show just has random things going on all over the place and it just didn't seem that miraculous as everyone claims .,1
"I have eaten at America's three times. The first two times the food was good, but not fantastic. The third time, I was the only one in the restaurant stopped for a breakfast burrito and I waited 20 minutes to get my food. As I was leaving, I noticed that the counter attendant who had just handed me my burrito was now outback of the restaurant throwing up. Needless to say I will not be going back for the upchucka, err machaca, burrito.",1
Lousy service\n\nSo I ordered for a group lunch and they do not deliver unless you have 24 hours notice - however someone else in same office had it delivered and placed order less than 1 hour prior. The only reason I ordered from them was because the coworker had done so and had it delivered. Other places deliver. But they already had my credit card. \n\nWas told by manager that they use an outside service and they have to give them 25 hours notice.  Well I am sitting across from someone that did not need that. Whatever. \n\nI go to pick up the items and drive across town to do so. I get there and pick up and go back to office. I get there only to find that they have failed to provide the soup for one of the orders. \n\nI called to have price corrected. \nThen as I sit there - one other order was a salad with chicken on it and special instruction to remove pasta - no-chicken left the pasta on.  I didn't even bother to call at this point.\n\nI go to our Charlotte office pretty regularly we are a large company in the area. But we will not be ordering from here. \n\nAs far as food is concerned is wasn't bad food. The chicken pita fell apart but was tasty - the salads were good \n\nThe service was lousy,1
Everything here is so delicious!  The seafood is tasty and fresh.  The decor is beautiful inside.,4
"I was new to yoga and decided to buy a 10 class pass to attend yoga since this studio is right across the street from my school.  At the time I purchased the package they never informed me that the classes expired.  I got really busy with the school year and was only able to attend a few of the classes.  It had been several months since the last time I attended a class, and when I showed up they informed me that I did not have any classes remaining.  I assured them that I did, in fact I should have 6 classes remaining, but they were extremely dismissive and told me the pass must have expired.  I will never go to this studio again, and I intend to tell everyone at my school that they steal your money.  With as much school loans as I have, I cant afford to give my money to a sleazy yoga studio.",0
Worst fast food service in the world! Burger King we were at your location just before noon today 5/25/14.  Seriously the girl at the  drive through shouldn't be working in the customer service industry.  It took her 3 times to get the order right and she was rood the whole time.  She asked my wife to repeat herself three time the got snippy with my wife each time.  \n\nDon't go there the food is under cooked. They don't speak to you like you are an important customer let alone a human.  I will  listen to the reviewer who said go down the road to Wendy's.  \n\nKeep your under cooked burgers BK,0
"Sports bar themed place with nice pool tables and occasionally has live music.\n\nIts close to where I just moved to, I mean REALLY close.  So, I'll end up here again, even though I havn't been impressed so far.\n\nI've been twice, both times were to watch football.  Its good for that.  Some random food and drink specials including half priced wings or half priced ribs.  Both times I've eaten there the food has been edible, but not great.  Both times my service was spotty at best as well.\n\nA couple decent drafts on tap, don't really have much more to say.",2
"I really hate writing bad reviews but I am left with little option when the best thing about this place is their Coke machine.  It is one of those where you can customize all these flavor add-ins.  \n\nTheir meatballs are not too good. I ordered the Original, and even though the flavor was acceptable, it had some kind of grisly bits in it.  I have no idea what it was, but it had a most unpleasant texture.  I was too scared to take it out of my mouth and look at it, so I did the next best thing...I swallowed it.  The meat sauce that it came with was almost as bad - salty and no flavor.  But I did find it amazing that the vegetables I ordered tasted just like the ones served at my school cafeteria.  How do you take carrots, broccoli, and squash, and boil the shit out it so that they all taste the same? I tried to force myself to finish those, but was prevented from doing so by the pieces of broccoli bark.  Seriously, you are not supposed to cut up and serve the base of the broccoli.  It is too woody and fibrous.  I must look like a beaver.  They also had some pizzas on display, but ironically, they did not look as tasty as the meatballs.\n\nBut the family that owns it is very nice.  I will continue to buy my sodas from them in the future.",0
"call me biased but I love Scottsdale stadium. The home of my San Francisco Giants spring training and the Scottsdale scorpions for AFL. The prices to catch game are little pricer than the other spring training stadiums but well worth it. The food is some of the best in Cactus League. Fan favorite is the wok shop and the guy who shout \""lemonade lemonade like grandma made.\"" So many memories are made here every year. \n\nI would highly recommend for any baseball fan to come check out an AFL game once in your lifetime. Subsidized by the MLB tickets are dirt cheap and fun to watch the future stars of all teams play. The concession are limited at this time, but there is plenty of places around the stadium to go after either game.",4
"Can you say RIP OFF! I sat at the bar and ordered the Lobster Tacos. Some say 2 bites...I say one. I don't even think there was any lobster in those tiny little things. $21 for NOTHING.  The roasted tomato soup was good and came with a  mini grilled cheese that was about as small as the tacos. And for $14,  they don't give you a cup or a bowl, but something in-between. Still very hungry,  I ordered the \""adult tater tots\"" ($10) with Brie cheese. Funny...I didn't taste any brie cheese or any kind of cheese for that matter. Yet another rip-off. Thank God I didn't order an entree. I could only imagine what a disaster that would have been. Total bill for one with tip $60! I had to go get dinner after I left! Unless you like getting treated like a stupid tourist stay far away from this place!",0
"Coming from LA, I am familiar with La Grande Orange in Pasadena. However, I never had their pizzas until I visited this little shop in Phoenix. It was delicious and the novelty and combination of taste - AMAZING! Between the 3 of us, we ordered:\n\nMushroom pizza: Pretty good, lots of 'shrums for those who like mushrooms\nCorn and Avocado: Now that was delicious covered with chunks of goat cheese! I love goat cheese, tastes almost like cream cheese :)\nThe Gladiator pizza: Pretty much an all meat pizza\nThe Tomato and Basil: Yum\n\nThey even have vegetarian options for those who don't eat meat. It's a great late night snack. I don't usually eat the crust but they made it so well that I wasn't picky about it. \n\nOh, and we also ordered chicken wings - it was alright but I would say stick to the pizzas.",4
"I truly enjoyed this place. Super clean, friendly staff, large (ok, ginormous) selection of toppings and, get this, bottomings. \n\nI tried the oatmeal cookie, cake batter, red velvet, and peanut butter flavors. \n\nHave I ever mentioned I'm a sucker for peanut butter? : )\n\nThe only flavor I didn't care for was the red velvet. I'm the first to admit chocolate is never top on my list, but this seemed way too fake. Eh.\n\nI did, however, truly enjoy the oatmeal cookie. They have this one in the bag. \n\nPerhaps my next spin through will involve some of the fruit flavors. Who knows? I can be a bit capricious.",3
"I love Gallo Blanco so I knew I was bound to enjoy Otro Cafe. I started with some yummy guac and despite the fact that it was a million degrees out I was so utterly compelled to try the chicken soup and I'm so glad I did. The small order was huge with rice noodles and chunks of white meat in a delicous broth. The BEST thing about the soup is that they serve basil, cilantro, peppers and spicy soy sauce to season to your taste.....part of me wished it was cold and I was sick so that I have it cure me......I know I'm a sick bastard.\n\nI finished up with carne asada and shrimp tacos (shrimp aren't my favorite, truth be told!) and a side of black beans. I really enjoyed my meal and my sever was so sweet and friendly. The ONLY thing they didn't have which I was so looking forward to was the chicarron de queso, the awesome cheese crisp they serve at Gallo Blanco. I REALLY hope they add this to the menu.\n\nSo glad these guys are here because Gallo Blanco can get crowded.",3
"If I could give 0 stars I would. The worst customer service I have ever encountered in my life! First of all, I had a bed delivered there since I had not yet moved into my new place. When I received the email confirming that my package had been shipped and arrived at this location, I rented a U-Haul so I could pick it up. When I went to the store, the girl working at the time preceded to tell me it was not there and she had not received anything under my name. I showed her the email verification and she continuously denied ever seeing it.  I noticed a rather large box behind her and thought that may be it.  Not once did she even try to look but just stared blankly at a piece of paper. She told me that the email basically meant the package was in route to the store when clearly it stated it had arrived. I called the next day and a man answered the phone just to tell me my my package arrived two days before.  When I went back, I found out the very package I asked the girl to take a look at was the one that belonged to me. I was furious I wasted my time and money renting a U-Haul.  Fed Ex ended up delivering my bed to my house to compensate for this girl's lack of customer service and pure laziness. All of this could have simply been avoided. I will never use them again for anything and I suggest you do not either!",0
Good food. Much better than your standard pub grub. The garlic bread is especially awesome. Nice wait staff and a few TVs to watch.,2
I went there for the first time last week. I found that I really liked the looks of their sleepwear(I'm big into night gowns) and they happened to have a large selection of night gowns. I was in a hurry to get home the first time I went there so I got a night gown in my normal size medium. I got home and tried it on and found out I was a small. I ended up going back to the store a few days later to do an exchange. The staff was friendly and helpful when it came down to my exchange and even helped me select a nice dress that they had just gotten in that day. I was pleased with the service and the products that I selected from the store. I will defantely be shopping there again!,4
"As a visitor to Pittsburgh (and the middle portion of the country in general), I must say that the service at Pamela's compared to other diners really added something to my meal. The host, waitress, and even the fellow diners were just so friendly and happy. \n\nI guess it's hard to be unhappy when surrounded by 80's pink and teal, with a huge pile of pancakes with whipped cream and chocolate in front of you. \n\nCommitting carbicide never before made me feel this cheerful.\n\nBrad's rating (out of 5):\nPrice: 5\nFood: 3\nDecor: 3\nService: 5+\nWild card: No waiting, even for a Saturday morning!",3
"I rarely write reviews so this must really got to me for me to write one.  \nThis place has absolutely the worse service possible.  If you could, just buy what you need from Amazon.\n\nI was buying a Macbook Air on the student promo that they had.  One of their reps, named Dylan told me that that they didn't have one on stock and i should be able to pick one up later that week.  The next day i got an email saying that my order will be cancelled if i didn't get an email from best buy.  Apparently the idiot just placed the order in the in store system (which he knew didn't have a stock) and not in the corporate system to get a new order shipped to the store.\n\nNow, the problem is i had to order another one and spend another $700 or so to get another one ordered. i spoke to another service rep named Kevin.  He told me he could it to me that sunday or monday at the latest.  Apparently he is another idiot and what he had in the system was Tuesday to thursday or so.  I couldn't stay home at that time to receive the laptop.  You wouldn't want a Macbook air left on the patio would you.  He couldn't even arrange that i pick it up front he store.\n\nI talked to a supervisor and manager and he acknowledged my frustration and that they were also at fault.  He said there was nothing he could do.  What was absolutely frustrating was that it was like he didn't really care.  \n\nBUY FROM AMAZON!!! going to a physical store is supposed to be better because we get to talk to associates.  Associates at Best buy are plain idiots!!!! absolutely no sensible customer service at all. \n\nEven if the email said my first order said it was automatically supposed to cancel itself and refund me by a certain date.  that did not happen. i had to go back there to have it cancelled.  I eventually got my money but DAMN!!! i had to pay $1400++ to get a $700 in my house when i wanted a pick up.\n\nDO NOT BUY HERE!!!",0
Customer service is great. Prices are good. Doughnuts are too salty for my taste. I tried the Fat Elvis and a cinnamon sugar. My husband had the chocolate with nuts. He liked his but I tasted all three and found all too salty- not sweet enough and didn't want to spend the calories and finish them.,2
"The restaurant is pretty, and the staff was very friendly; but when it comes to the food, it was not very good, it wasn't disgusting but it wasn't good. I had a tostada of fish ceviche, nothing that will make me come back, I also had fish tacos and those were okay.",2
"So after a night of partying and drinking, we decided to have some breakfast at this pho restaurant. I've never been here and my friends picked this place as they usually come here when they're in Vegas.\n\nThere are two areas to this restaurant, the nice side and the not so nice side. I'm assuming the nice side was for the dinner crowd and the other was for breakfast and lunch. The side we got seated in was, in my opinion, dirty. The floors looked like he hasn't been mopped in weeks and the tables looked like they have been there since they first opened.\n\nService here is quick and they speak a multitude of languages. We all ordered the pho and the wait for it wasn't too long; less than 10 minutes.\n\nThey brought out two different vegetable dishes for us; one with the thai basil, lime, and sliced jalapeno peppers while the other one had the cooked bean sprouts (they lost it's crunchyness from being cooked... i was wondering why they didn't just bring out the raw ones like all other places and cooked being requests).\n\nThe broth was pipping hot and clear. It had a hint of flavor but not too much, it was more on the bland side. After a lot of hoison sauce and plenty of hot sauce, it was fine... it was passable.\n\nThe iced coffee here is not good. It's like they used Folgers coffee. It was bad.",1
"Worst service I've had in a very long time. We were a group of 4 around 8pm. Seated immediately which was nice! Waitress didn't check on us for 15 minutes, and didn't get us water for another 10. \n\nLong, very long, story short they are slow as molasses here. Maybe I could have forgiven them if their food wasn't on par with Applebee's, but no such luck.",1
Spicy Tuna......Tasted barely OK.   Something I'd expect at an All-You-Can-Eat in Omaha.....\n\nSpicy Albacore..... See Spicy Tuna.\n\nFresh Water Eel.... Good,1
On a windy Spring day we stumbled into this place looking for some warmth. The JPop exiting the speakers and various anime playing on each tv screen catches you off guard but once you're greeted and seated by the cosplay girls everything comes full circle. \n\nThe crowd here is quite eclectic. The food here is good but I've had better for less. I'd return for the atmosphere but not for food alone. The kimchee fried rice is really good I will say that but it's more expensive than other places I've been that had packed more flavor.,2
"I met some friends here for dinner and drinks, finding the place is a little tricky especially if you don't make frequent trips Uptown. \n\nThey offer valet but I'd suggest just parking I the BoA parking garage and taking the elevator down to the restaurant. The atmosphere is fine, nothing fancy but you should expect it from a BBQ joint. The place wasn't busy so we were seated right away. \n\nThe menu is not very extensive, but includes all the classics : ribs, pulled pork and brisket just to name a few items. For starters we ended up ordering some wings. It's not a bad deal for just $5 you get half a dozen wings with blue cheese and some other dipping sauce. The wings were very tasty! The came out hot and packed with flavor. \n\nFor my meal I went with the pulled pork sandwich and cheese grits. Meh, it was okay. I've had better pulled pork at other BBQ places and they didn't really give a lot of meat on the sandwich....more bun than meat is no bueno!!! The cheese grits were decent...but again nothing to write home about. If I came back I'd stick with the wings. \n\nSo why the low score??? Aside from the average food the waitress/bartender had a horrible attitude. I've said this before and I'll say it again....if customer service is NOT your thing....please do us all a favor and pick another job!!! Shitty service ruins the experience and meal every time! Even if the food had been better I'd have to strongly consider give my money to someone who rolls their eyes at me and my guests AND ignores my requests while I'm eating (excuse me for needing a refill on my drinks and extra napkins....ugh!). \n\nSo try this place at your own risk...or just grab some wings to go!",1
"I have been to this place several times and it never disappoints.  A good neighbourhood BYOW - the service is friendly and efficient. The food is good - nothing spectacular but reliable. I started with  a green salad and then the \ngrilled salmon (overcooked) served with a choice of rice,pasta, potatoes or veg,  I chose pasta in tomato sauce which was well cooked (al dente) and good.  Since I had the table d'hote it came with coffee and  I also had choice of  dessert.  I chose chocolate grand mariner cheesecake,which I gave away - but judging by the way it was decimated I'd say it was a hit. \n\nDinner & Tip was $48ish\n\nNote to restos - why do you all overcook the fish? You all ask people how they like their meat - you should do the same for fish s.v.p.",2
"Sens is wonderful. I went on a Friday night, Carlo waited on my friend and I. He was extremely helpful and made lots of good suggestions. He also kept bringing us really good infused sake to try. The Hong Kong Flat Rice was amazing. I will definitely make this a frequent stop.",4
"Based on the name and outside advertisements, you'd assume that this was some sort of pork style specialty house. Once inside you'd assume that it would smell like pork. You'd assume there would be pictures of swine everywhere. And you'd assume that not only will the menu be pork heavy, but that also the server would promote and encourage pork. So imagine my surprise when none of these things were true.\n\nIt wasn't a big deal though that it seems they were trying real hard to be a classy restaurant. But its an oink cafe. That means pig coffee to me. I want Bacon and an espresso. It should smell like Bacon and coffee. Or Bacon or coffee. It was more of a chemical smell. \n\nThe layout was odd too. There were apparently two entrances. What I thought was the front which is located street side might have been the back because when you walk in, its a weird long hallway type room filled with tables. (BTW it was packed) The other side had what looked like a main counter with a menu but we never got that far because this was a be seated by server place.\n\nDecorations were odd too. There were SOME artsy pictures of swine. But mostly random pictures of art. I love art but it didn't fit. \n\nOur server must have been a rookie. Not very attentive. She kind of just threw the crayons in front of my daughter. She didn't explain the menu at all. It took her forever to bring our drinks. And I even tried to break the ice by asking the standard \""what would you get?\"" question. Her response, \""I'm not really sure. I think everything's good.\""  Ok when I hear that I get annoyed. Humuor me at least. Also know you product and services. And if your going to promote a \""classy\"" resturant, then don't wear short shorts. Nothing made sense. On to the menu:\n\nBasically the menu is basic items like sanwhiches and salads that have one or two Bacon strips. Ok. Well I got the salad. And to my surprise it was pretty good.\n\nIt was a fresh spinach salad with an assortment of seeds and fruit and Bacon bits. Also they had a custom dressing called Bacon dressing. Now it tasted nothing like Bacon. It was more of a sweet vinagerette of sort. It was good. The salad though was amazing. it wasn't over filled with everything. It was mostly spinach. And again very fresh. \n\nSalad was good enough to give a three star. Also it wasn't a bad experience, just dissapointing. And the only reason I factor in the poor server is because the owner himself was walking around greeting people and when he got to us, he wasn't really engaged or genuine. So perhaps a lack of customer service training could be the reason for our poor service. \n\nIf your in the area and you want a salad for lunch, I'd recommend them.",2
"I went there with 4 people including myself, last Saturday night. I mistakingly took the advice of a reviewer that if you dine in the common area, you would not need a reservation. Got there around 8PM and the place was packed.\n\nThe hostess told us it would be 1- 1/2 hour wait, an obvious attempt to tell us we would not be seated. Since we drove all the way there, parked and had no back-up plan, we decided to have a drink and talk about what to do.\n\nI made it to the bar, but my 2 friends and wife were headed off at the pass by the hostess and told they could not go to the bar because it would be blocking traffic through the kitchen. Not kidding. The bar was not crowded, but small. Seats mostly taken, yes.\n\nI came back when I saw the horror on my wife and friends faces and asked her \"" So you are telling us we can wait 1-1/2 hour for a table, but not have a drink at the bar? How about the restrooms, are they off limits?\"" She promptly ignored my questions and started talking to incoming patrons. Very very rude and obnoxious.\n\nI know how it is in the industry, I have worked it and so has my wife. Yes, things can get busy, but this was simply silly.\n\nI warn the owners: Your place is hot, strike fast-yes-, but have a plan for longevity. In a market that is this fickle, with customer service like this, you won't get many repeat customers in the future once the buzz dies down. Like Pop-Rocks or Pet-Rocks, this will be your place in 2012 if you keep asleep at the wheel when it comes to the little things, like the customers satisfaction and desire for a good experience.\n\nI would not recommend this place unless they dramatically change their attitude.\n\nPAC",0
The food was really good along with the service but the prices were much too High. I loved how the place gives you such a comfortable feeling though. The chips and salsa were DELICIOUS.,3
"Food was good, service was prompt and very friendly.  Cho was great, very pleasant.\n\nWould recommend for both other locals as well as tourists.",3
"Yuck, something has gone downhill here.  Tried it for the first time in a very long time again today, and it is not as good as it used to be.",1
Loved the mexican pizza.,2
"I really wanted to like to like Arcadia Tavern more than I did.  There is so much to love about this neighbor sports bar.  It has a wonderful set up to check out a game and enjoy a beer.  The service is excellent.  However, the food left a lot to be desired.\n\nMy girlfriend and I decided to check the place out since they had a Restaurant Week deal.  We called ahead just to make sure they weren't packed, and the girl on the phone said a table just opened up and she's save it for us.  Good start.  The parking lot is small and could be a cluster so Arcadia Tavern provides complimentary valet.  That also works for me.  A live band was a nice touch, but it also made the place a little too loud for 8:00. \n\nThe Restaurant Week deal was from a selection of an appetizer, two entrees and a dessert for $30.  We went with the spinach dip, the fish and chips and half roasted chicken, and the arcadia cookie.  The spinach dip was great, the chips that came with it were nothing special.  The fish and chips were less than stellar.  Neither the fish or fries were very flavorful.  The Chicken was really good, but not something I would really order from a tavern.  The cookie was okay, but way too under baked.  I know that a \""pizza cookie\"" in a skillet is supposed to be under baked, but this could've definitely used another minute or two in the oven.  It was more like warm cookie dough with ice cream.\n\nArcadia Tavern does have a pretty good beer selection.  Drafts were served in Goblet filled all the way to rim.  I don't know why, but I always find that to be pretty cool to drink out of a goblet.\n\nIf you live in the area, and are looking for a place to eat and watch a game, this a place worth checking out.  There are many sandwich and burger options, plus wings and more traditional tavern food.  I think if I were to return, I will give those a try.",2
Pollo con queso is ridiculous! Huge menu. Also try the white sands sauce.,2
"Of course, the first problem with being a regular here is that you have to tell you friends to meet you at a place called Xtreme Bean.  It sounds like some horrible Taco Bell concoction.   Assuming you can move past the name, you might like this place.\n\nI walked into the cafe and realized it used to be a bank which is sort of interesting, I suppose.  The associate (I hesitate to call him a barista) greeted me, \""What's up bro?\""  Though very informal, he certainly wasn't being rude.  That's a good way to summarize the feel of the whole place actually.  Aside from my \""bro\"", none of the other 5 or 6 employees made eye contact or spoke to me.  \n\nMy latte was completely unremarkable.  That's not to say it was bad.  It was just a latte.  In fact, I'd venture to guess that I would not have been able to pick it out of a lineup of lattes from Starbucks.  \n\nIf you're in your late 20s early 30s, you might love the atmosphere.  While I was there, AC/DC, Led Zeppelin, Bruce Springsteen, and Pearl Jam were pumping, quite loudly, through the sound system.  If you're not in that age bracket or just not a fan of classic rock- you might be annoyed.\n\nThere's always the high-speed wifi, which was very fast.\n\nThe entire place had a very corporate feeling to it.  I don't mean that as an insult.  It looked clean and well-calculated to create a feeling of coolness, if that makes any sense.  \n\nI never did find the restroom here either.... not sure where it is.\n\nUltimately, not bad, but not great.  I'd rather drive 1 minute south on McClintock to Steve's.\n\n--\n\nUPDATE:\n\nEven though I talk crap about this place, and even though it's really not very good, I still go there a few times a week.  Here's why: they're the only ones open.  Despite the fact that ASU is one of the 3 largest universities in the nation, our local establishments keep bankers hours.  Steve's closes at 10, Gold Bar at 10, hell, even the Starbucks nearby closes at 10 (9 on Sundays... 9!?  In a city?).  \n\nSo yeah, if you're awake past your bedtime, Xtreme Bean is pretty much your only choice other than IHOP or Del Taco.  And I'm not touching coffee made at either of those establishments.\n\nUnfortunately, everyone else is in the same boat.  Which means, the baristas are in a huge rush most of the time (and, thus, aren't terribly pleasant) and good luck finding a good seat.  You're likely to be stuck in the \""study room\"" which is woefully underlit or the main room which is frequently very noisy.\n\nSo-- crappy coffee joint, but the only game in town past 10pm.",2
"Had their \""signature\"" dry aged NY strip. Not very special. Go for the rib eye or Prime rib. Service was great, but for the price the food could be much better.",2
"Food was very good, service was non-existant.  We waited for 20 minutes after dinner to get coffee and we waited for 30 minutes for the check.  If we had service, it would have been 5 stars.",2
"Well this is a fairly new place to the airport. All the chains have left the airport pretty much. There are still a few.\nBut a lot of them are independent, however HMS host has their hand in some,if not all. Not that that is a bad thing.\nAnyway I gave them a try one morning about 8:45. I am precise because, that is what it says on my receipt.\nThe girl taking the order is not very happy and I think that it is very high priced.\nYes even for the Airport.\nIt is very confusing the way you get in line to order your coffee as well. You actually have to go through another place to get to the ordering station.\nStarbucks have all gone away from the inner part of the Terminal. 4 now. So you do have some choices. But, I cannot say a lot of great things about Lola's either.",2
"This is one of the first hotels that I have stayed at prior to the Venetian. It is a hotel for kids. The rooms are not as fancy as the Venetian. There is a coupon book given for guests. Typically, I use the buy 1 get 1 game coupon or I get the free donut from Krispy Kreme. In certain rooms, you can smell smoke. People smoke in the casino, so you will smell it when walking to the adventuresome or the main gaming area.",1
"I've been to Nola on the Square a total of three times now, and (thankfully) every trip was better than the last.\n\nMy first trip there was a bit rocky.  Granted, I was there on a Saturday night with a group of about 10.  Plus the restaurant had only been open for a few weeks at that point, so they were probably still working the kinks out at that point.  The packed restaurant definitely took a toll on our service, which was verrrry slow.  And by the time our party arrived, our waiter informed us that they were completely out of pasta, which resulted in almost half the table having to re-examine the menu for another option, including myself.  I understand that this happens, but it still looked pretty bad to be out of pasta by 8pm on a Saturday night in a relatively new restaurant.  I ended up ordering the special dish of the night, which was steak with some form of potatoes and spinach.  All very good, but nothing to write home about.\n\nMy second visit found myself and my parents there late on a Sunday afternoon.  We walked in to find the restaurant relatively empty of both patrons.....and staff.  There were three hostesses working, and after receiving a poorly-disguised eye roll from one after I told her we didn't have reservations, they all informed us that the ENTIRE wait staff was currently in a meeting, so no one was available yet to take our order.  We then proceeded to wait 20 minutes for the wait staff meeting to adjourn before we could even order a glass of water.  But I put my annoyance at that situation on the hostessses, not the waiters.  It wasn't the waiters fault they were ALL pulled into a meeting simultaneously, and apparently it wasn't in the hostess' job description to ask paying patrons if they wanted something to drink while we waited.  But ANYWAY.  Once our waitress arrived (she was quite lovely), she promptly brought our drinks and took our order.  Our food arrived in a timely manner and was very good.  I had the smoked pork chop which was massive and cooked and seasoned very well.  So despite the horribly rocky start, our meal ended quite nicely.\n\nSo FINALLY, upon my third visit, I had a completely positive Nola experience.  My group was promptly seated and our server was very informative and attentive the entire time.  I ordered the Scallps Mac Daddy which was soooooo yummy.  It's hard to go wrong with any combination of mac and cheese plus seafood, so this dish was absolutely delicious.  I can't wait to go back for my fourth visit and get it again!\n\nSo, after working some glitches out of its system, Nola finally seems to be working like the well-oiled machine it was always meant to be!",2
"I've been to better breakfast joints!  However, the service has always been good and it's close to our house.  The food is nothing to write home about.  The eggs benedict are decent and the omelets so, so.   However the hog wild skillet breakfast is quite tasty!",1
"This is one of those local hidden gems.  Could the walls use a painting?  Probably.  Could the interior be slightly updated?  Probably.  Does any of it matter?  Probably not.  The sanitation grade was 96.  The food is cheap, good, and fast, and the people are friendly.  Order at the front and they will bring the order to your table.  $5.05 plus tax for a killer steak pita dripping with mayo and dressing plus a bunch of good fries?  I'll be back.",3
"The service was great, the product was not. The meal started with some really good corn bread, so we had high hopes. The iced tea was so bad we sent it back twice and ended up switching to Pepsi. They forgot our appitizer until after they brought out the entre. The  q rolls were OK once they got to us. The pulled pork was so over cooked it was nearly the consistency of mashed potatoes. The brisket was ok, nothing worth the $22 price tag for the 2 meat combo. All that being said they knocked of the app and one drink.",1
"Horrible experience! After waiting an hour I got a cold pizza delivered to me! Best of all it had no sauce! Didn't want to wait so just got jimmy johns next door! Called the manager, Denice to explain frustration of what transpired the previous day only to be told to argue with the rude manager. This place sucks!",0
"Not pleased. I've lived here for 3 months and I am sorely disappointed. Initially, Dorsey Place seemed like a good choice; nice apartments, great location, and friendly staff. Oh, was I wrong! From the beginning, the staff couldn't figure out how to spell my name, which resulted in constant miscommunication. It took a minimum of three phone calls to solve that issue. After we moved in, we had a host of complaints that weren't addressed until very recently including a broken back door, a broken fridge, and chipping paint. They advertise that you can pay your rent online, however that is not true. I tried doing so and thought that my troubles with Dorsey Place were over. Nope. They never charged my bank and returned my payment. They ended up charging me a $50 fee for insufficient funds (which was not accurate) and threatened to take me to court, although I had received no summons. All in all, this place has it out for you. They're looking for young, college kids who don't know much about renting apartments and are looking to commit fraud against them. If you're thinking of renting here, keep looking. Not worth it.",0
"I saw a lot of mixed reviews on Burger Bar (both for this location and the one in San Francisco), but I was still eager to try it after seeing it featured on Top Chef Masters.\n\nIt actually took some time to find it.  Burger Bar is not located in Mandalay Bay but Mandalay Place, which is a little shopping mall adjacent to the casino.  It was late in the morning (just before 11:00am) and the mall was pretty empty.  When Burger Bar opened though, there were quite a few groups waiting to go in.\n\nThe atmosphere was kind of like a chain family restaurant without all the kitsch and decorations.  The atmosphere was loud, casual and comfortable, but there was nothing to it.  The dining area was not that big.  Seating was available via tables, booths and the bar.\n\nThe focus on the menu, of course, was burgers and fries.  While it was expensive for burgers and fries, it did not feel expensive for Las Vegas.  Many menu items were less than $20 and gourmet burgers do go in the $12-$18 range in L.A.  At Burger Bar, there are a few pricier burgers and burgers can be customized with some fancy ingredients (like lobster) that can lead to some really pricey burgers.\n\nI went with the American Kobe Beef burger.  The burger was about small-to-medium sized.  A lot of burger places like The Counter and Father's Office definitely have bigger burgers.  The bun (which can be customized) was nice.  The tomatoes, green leaf lettuce and onions were fresh, but they were very ordinary.  I got some cheese, which was an extra cost, and some homemade Dijon mustard.  The meat had a good flavor and was juicy (also not too greasy).  It was not anything great, but it was a decent, okay burger.\n\nI ordered some of the fat fries, which the waitress recommended.  Skinny fries and sweet potato fries were also available.  I liked the fries, but they were not as hot as they should have been, which was kind of odd.  Since they just opened the restaurant, I was surprised the fries tasted like they had been sitting around for a while.  I've definitely had my share of food in Vegas that was served cold, but I would think this place would have a higher standard.\n\nThe milkshake was expensive but good.  It was a chocolate and Nutella milkshake.  It had a good flavor and consistency.  It could have been a little colder.  It was topped with crunchy hazelnuts, chocolate syrup and chocolate whipped cream.  It was definitely heavy on the chocolate and probably could have used something contrasting to balance the shake out.  While I liked the shake, the portion was a little on the small side.\n\nThe waitress was very good--attentive, informed about the menu and friendly.\n\nThere is a lot of bad and overpriced food in Vegas because the casinos know they have a captive audience and they let their standards slip.  Burger Bar, while not great, is definitely better than some of the Vegas restaurants I've tried.  It also presents a better value (though maybe slightly overpriced, considering the size of portions, when compared to some burger joints in other major cities).  Still, if you go to one of those cafes in Vegas, you are probably going to spend right around the same amount for a burger.\n\nI probably would not make a special trip to Burger Bar, but if we were around Mandalay Bay again, needed some food and weren't looking to spend too much, Burger Bar would definitely be a place I would give another try.\n\nFinal Note: For me, celebrity chef restaurants often feel more like a brand than a representation of the chef's food because the chef is hardly ever there.  Chef Hubert Keller was there that day; he was not in the kitchen though.  He was having a meeting (outside of the restaurant in the mall area).",2
"I'm from NY and we tend to be snobby about our pizza...but this place is GOOD. This review is simply for the pizza, not for the restaurant itself (we did take-out). Apparently this place ships in their water from the Motherland of Pizza, and apparently it makes all the difference. There's also something about their sauce that also hits the mark. I've ordered from this place 3 times now and have not been disappointed once. Even the size of their caesar salad was impressive, and definitely enough for 2.\n\nOverall, quality pizza at a decent prize. NYPD is where it's at in PHX.",3
"They always have everything I need in stock and are more than willing to help me find it. They generally have some awesome sales going on, also.",4
"Breakfast club was a nice breakfast spot in OldTown Scottsdale. They have a good menu with quality breakfast items that were reasonably priced. The food was good, nothing special however. When I ordered coffee, it came out cold, but the waitress replaced it quickly. The staff was friendly but service was average. Overall it was good, but nothing special. Good spot to bring co-workers or friends. Oh there might be a little wait early morning and during lunch time.",2
"I've pretty much had it with this theater. My recent visit Saturday night was a disaster.\n\nFirst, this theater is in downtown Phoenix so it attracts the \""not so nice\"" movie going crowd. I'm not saying everyone here is a problem, but you should go to a movie here fully expecting people to be talking during the whole movie, texting, using their cell phones, etc. I have never seen a film here where this wasn't the case. During our screening, two people answered their RINGING CELL PHONES and two college aged girls yapped to each other during the entire movie. The guy in front of us was texting as well. It's so rude but it is the norm at this theater, and management refuses to do anything (booting out the offenders would be a start but if they did that, I fear they'd have no customers). \n\nSecond, the snack bar clearly says they offer Coke Zero as a soda choice but they serve you Diet Coke. We had them fill our cup FOUR times from FOUR different machines and every single time the \""Coke Zero\"" was actually Diet Coke. If you are a fan of my Yelp reviews, you know that I freaking know the difference between the two sodas and believe you me, this theater is trying to pass off Diet Coke as Coke Zero. I've alerted the Coca-Cola company about this because it irritates me to no end. \n\nThird, the parking here is horrible! There's a garage which means a bit of a walk from your car to the theater. I don't mind this but in rainy or windy weather, it really stinks! The parking rates are exorbitant at $2 per each $20 minutes (maximum charge of $12). AMC Theaters provides validation but for two hours only! This is NOT enough time! Most movies have a run time of at least 1 hour 45 minutes and that doesn't count allowing enough time to park, buy your ticket, get your popcorn and sit through 25 minutes of previews! COME ON! Three hours should be the minimum validation. As a result of this stingy validation, we ended up having to pay $9.00 just to park to go to a stupid movie on a Saturday afternoon. \n\nThis downtown center is dying and I say \""good riddance.\"" It's things like this that will drive this theater out of business too, and it won't be a moment too soon.",0
"Very well run establishment. There are no surprises, consistently great prices and good service. It is one of the last LOCAL remaining family businesses in town, and should be supported!",3
"This review concerns the poker room and the pai gow tables; I did not stay at the hotel.  The staff at the poker room was nice, but they did not have a game going in the middle of the day on a Sunday.  Eventually one started, but come on, run some promotions or something to make sure you at least have one table going in the middle of the day on a weekend.  The pai gow dealers were very nice and I had no problem getting a seat while waiting for a poker table to open.",2
"Habit Burger is a pretty good place if you're in the mood for a burger and want something better than McDonald's but don't want to spend $10 at one of those gourmet places. They fall right in the middle, think In N' Out without the long wait and mediocre fries. What I like best about Habit Burger is that they actually grill their burgers, and because of this they aren't greasy. They also have sweet potato fries and they're delicious. The place is always clean and the staff is courteous and friendly.",2
"My friends and I were craving frozen yogurt right after a celebration of the end of our Semester 3 in nursing school at YardHouse. We decided to stop by this place and try their frozen yogurt. It's just like U-Swirl in Henderson, where you self-serve your own yogurt, put your own toppings, and get charged about 40 cents per ounce.\n\nQuite honestly, the frozen yogurt was pretty good. The taro flavor was just delicious. I also had their green tea frozen yogurt, but it wasn't pleasing. Red Mango's green tea is definitely better! The bad thing about the place was the fruits; they were SOOOO tarty! EHHH...They were for sure frozen...\n\nI would have given this place 2 stars, but the taro frozen yogurt saved it...",2
"Disappointing, unfortunately. The food was OK, but not that great (at least compared to other steakhouse such as Houston's steakhouse). The server was very welcoming but was pushing a bit too much. For example, she asked several times if we wanted to take the molten cake for desert and insisted. We decided to try it and it wasn't that great (you could taste that the fruits were just unfrozen while the rest of cake wasn't).",2
I needed some real VEGAS time.....some gambling and nothing else.  They have the most $5 tables on the strip so someone suggested we go there and check it out. The craps table is usually pretty packed and for good reason. I made a lot of money in this place (that i subsequently lost elsewhere). \n\nSo much money that the first night when I stumbled in there I had to ask the guy the name of the place just to be sure I remembered it correctly. Or it could have been because I was a bit inebriated and still ended up doing well on the craps table. I like vegas. \n\nThey had some super cheap drinks too. $1 beers and $3 u call its.... \nawesome place to gamble,3
"Me: Serial gym hopper, recovering gym rat. \n\nSeeking: The perfect gym. \n\nVerdict....wow. Lots of equipment, some I've never seen before. Friendly staff. CrossFit. Heavy bags. Sauna AND steam room, love it. A little more expensive than the discount gym factories but absolutely worth it.",4
"Best ribs in Vegas! Locals favorite. Microbrews for $1.50 and they are really good. The only reason I did not give 5 full stars is the hour to 2 hour wait to get a seat, as I said... locals favorite.",3
"Would give it a zero if that was an option. Will not ever eat here again. It used to be a great place to eat but new management changed it all. Waited 50 minutes for our order to be taken. Our party of eight was already seated and knew what we wanted but they only took the drink orders. We were told they were out of French fries when requested as part of the kids meal. The steak was brought raw so they took it back, cooked it, and served it on the exact same plate as the raw steak. Took three tries to finally get a steak that wasn't still moving and a clean plate. We were treating the kids to dessert because the kid's meals had incredibly tiny portions but after almost three hours there we went next door to Walmart to get dessert. While there we saw the general manager buying a cartload of generic frozen French fries. Definitely not worth the money or time spent.",0
"I really like this place.  I've always preffered going to places that are a little more upscale then \""fantastic sams\"" or \""great clips\""... basic 12 hair cuts, but i never knew where to go.  The only way was that I'd have some sort of Chick salon and feel REALLY out of my element.\n\nEnter American Male.  40 bucks you get your cut shampoo, They do a hand wax thing, a hot towel and a head rub.  All fits within 30 mins.  I love it.  And to top it off they offer me a beer everytime when i walk in to check in.  Its the small things but i love it.",4
"The \""Gaygg\"" is our go-to spot for weekend bruch. The food is not terrific or fancy, but it's decent and predictable.  The wait on Sundays is typically about 15-20 minutes, but the staff is effecient and gets you in as quickly as possible.  We ate there this morning, and our meal took a while to get to the table, but someone from the restaurant came over and apologized for the long wait.  When I finally got my eggs, they were a bit cold, so I don't know what happened in the kitchen, because they are usually fairly speedy.  The breakfast specials are usually pretty tasty, and I always get a side order of $1 pancakes 'cause you never know when you are going to want a little bread soaked in syrup to top off a meal!  One hint--they will give you a large to-go glass of tea or soda if you ask nicely.",2
"what is wrong with you people, horrible horrible service luke-warm food, innattentive staff, understaffed, very expensive. never again.  you people must not be used to anything nice at all.never again, although all employees were still polite and smiled.",0
"So many things wrong with this place, let's start with what you experience when you enter the club. One of the first things you'll notice will be a group of security guards standing around bs'ing with each other. That's pretty much all you'll see them do, however on occassion, they'll hit on some of the female customers, or even have the audacity to ask people for drugs (I'm not even kidding, I saw this happen SEVERAL times...and it was not to \""bust\"" anyone, it was clearly for their personal consumption). The worst part is when they choose to get aggressive with a customer and drag them out to the street where they continue their assault until the Tempe PD show up and take over. Now don't get me wrong, I want security to handle unruly patrons when it's necessary, but these guys are so bored out of their minds that I'd venture an estimate that 75% of the time, their actions are completely unwarranted. Plain and simple, neither myself nor my friends felt even remotely safe. The line moves slowly, but once you get inside you can see that this place hasn't been properly cleaned in years. Check out the inch of filth on the drumset at the top of the stairs. Disgusting. The decor is equally gross, from the holes in the walls, to the horrible paintings, to the lack of any baseboards or trim at the bottom of the walls. Bathrooms are vile, of course I've only been in the men's room, but they usually have at least one urinal that's \""out of service\"", they never have any paper towels, you're lucky if one of the dispensers has any soap in it, and there's usually a bathroom attendant burning some nasty incense to try and mask the stench. Back in the main room, the bartenders are average, clearly any females there are hired more for their bra size than their ability to do their job. The only highlight behind the bar is a guy named Kenny, dude was hilarious and the only employee with a smile on his face (how anyone could remain positive working in this environment is beyond me). The cocktail server we had in the VIP overcharged us for a bottle, and my friend thinks that she swiped a hundred dollar bill from his pocket while she was groping him in an attempt to get a bigger tip. The DJ was some clown from 101.5 with an overblown ego, and was probably largely responsible for the predominantly ghetto crowd on the weekends. Soundsystem was a joke, you could hear the blown speakers rattling in the cabinets, and the jackass in the utility belt on a power trip who was \""running\"" it clearly has no clue what he's doing. I couldn't tell if this dork was their sound guy, a security guard, or a janitor since he seemed to be doing all three, the whole time making sure to be rude to customers and displaying a terrible attitude problem. Any positive reviews on this place were clearly written by people who work for the venue, do yourself, your friends, and your wallet a favor, AVOID THIS DUMP LIKE THE PLAGUE!",0
"This is a really nice looking and well maintained hotel. About a $60ish cab ride from the airport and about a $35ish cab ride to the strip. The restaurants are pretty good. I loved the fact that there is a bowling alley and 16 screens movie theater (2 of my fave entertainments). I DID NOT find most of the staff to be friendly tho. Especially one of the hotel manager's, Filippo, I think his name was. He WAS NOT personable at all. Great customer service is huge in my book, but this hotel does not have it. That is why I am only giving 2 stars, instead of 5. The staff could definitely take a course from the Downtown Philadelphia Marriott, where I have had the PLEASURE of staying for the past 9 years.",1
"All the staff here are very nice. The vets will sit and talk with you without rushing. The price is a bit high, but for the care and patience justifies the price and more.",4
"Just returned from a shockingly disappointing stay at the Orleans.  While I go there a couple times a year, it had been a few years since I actually \""Stayed\"" there.  Wow, what a disappointment.\n\nSo while the Prime Rib Loft and Canal Street were per the usual, i.e. very good, this review is specifically on the HOTEL.\n\nLet me list the problems, which were as voluminous as they were sleep hindering, and downright annoying:\n\n1)  We booked the \""upgraded / renovated rooms\"".  Temper your expectations, y'all.  This is merely some new wall paper, and carpet and furniture and counter tops.  The toilets were the same old toilets with chipped toilet seats, etc. Still looked quite tired.  There was a hole in the bathroom wall (where a hanging hook should have been) for one of our rooms.\n\n2)  The lighting in the rooms is quite bad.  This was exacerbated by one of the 3 sources of light outside the bathroom not having a light bulb.  This was perhaps foreshadowing that staying here was not a great idea.\n\n3)  Our shower had no hot water.  Max heat in the water was lukewarm, and we were freezing as we showered given it was going down to 33 degrees on the other side of the bathroom windows.  We called engineering and had it fixed.\n\n4)  Apparently in fixing one thing, another thing went wrong.   Somehow a 2'x2' patch of our carpet sprung a leak in the middle of the night.  We could not figure out where the water was coming from, but it took us an hour in the middle of the night, applying towels to the carpet to try and contain the dampness.  A great way to break up a night's sleep at 6AM when walking to the bathroom and feel the carpet squishing under your feet.\n\n5)  The next day, we had to change rooms, as the room was starting to smell dank from the dampness.  The new room came with new problems that also caused some major problems in the middle of the night.  Remember me mentioning it going down to 32-34 degrees overnight in vegas for the Xmas holiday?  Yeah, well around 5AM the heat kicks on.  Guess what?  Something wrong with the heating unit, despite it having an inspection sign off just a week prior with a \""merry xmas\"" note from the inspector on the unit...  Yeah, well...  Lets just say, it was malfunctioning - sounded like a slightly muted jackhammer when the heat came on.  Constant clanking, etc., and then the strong odor of burning plastic or rubber.  So wake up to what sounds like a jackhammer in the room and the smell of the room perhaps being on fire.  That woke us up pretty quick.  So we dress, air out the room for a while, etc.  Great night's sleep (again).\n\n6)  Upon check-out this AM, I told them - \""I ABSOLUTELY NEED A PHONE CALL FROM A SUPERVISOR OR A MANAGER SO I CAN TELL THEM ABOUT ALL MY PROBLEMS.  I URGE YOU TO HAVE SOMEONE CALL ME THIS AM - I AM NOT A HAPPY CAMPER.\""  They offered having me speak with someone while I was there.  Sorry, I had no time for that, I was late for a flight, and urged them again to have someone call me today.  Well, they took my number, and it's almost 10PM, and no one called.\n\nSorry, 6 strikes, and you are out.  One Star.  To put that in perspective, I have 84 reviews on yelp.  This is one of only 4 of those 84 that I gave only one star to.  I am not a hater, this was just an extremely poor experience that I wouldn't want to ever have again.",0
"I've been dying to try out The Old Fashioned since I got to Madison, but both times that I have gone during dinner, the place was packed like sardines in a can. Well, third times the charm, I guess. That, and the Craft Beer Week $5 bucket-o-beer was calling our names. \n\nThe boys split three $5 buckets between them. I'm not a big beer drinker, so I cannot attest to the quality or selection of beers in the buckets, but based on the boys' reactions, it seemed like the beers were either a hit or miss. Still, you can't really beat the $5 for 5 deal. Even if one beer is a total miss for you, there should still be four decent beers in the bucket. \n\nBuckets were sold out by 2PM though, so...BUMMER TO BE YOU if you didn't get there before then. I didn't even think there was going to be a limited number of buckets served, but I guess the owners of Old Fashioned have got to make a living too. \n\nAnyway, 15 beers deep + 1 rum&coke later, we were having a smashing good time.\n\nAll the alcohol aside...the service was great! Super attentive, but not of the pushy sort. Our waiter even split our bill 4 ways without our asking, which was really thoughtful. \n\nMinus one for the food, though. The bread on my sandwich was way over buttered and looked like it had been grilled for a few minutes too many. It made the entire sandwich really dry and difficult to swallow. No bueno. There also aren't many vegetarian/vegan choices on the menu to begin with, which is why I ended up getting the No.35 portabella sandwich anyway. Sadbear..this is just one more reason for me to strongly reconsider adding meats back into my diet...and if/when I do, Old Fashioned will be on the top of my list to return to. :)",3
This has to be one of the top restaurants in Charlotte. The food is always great and the staff is on point every time we dine here. (We sit at the bar almost every time). \n\nThe Bar staff is friendly and if we go to SouthPark we can count on a great time at Bricktops.,4
"Great value for the money. The water park is fun, plus they have a lot of smaller, quieter pools where you can relax. The staff is very friendly, but housekeeping doesn't clean your room until @ 4:30!  I would definitely stay here again. Warning, the sofa bed isn't very comfortable, you can feel the springs when you sleep.",2
Worst service I've ever experienced. We get here for lunch time and we sat at a table for over 10 minutes. We stare at the bar tender hoping he gets the message...he doesn't. My friend goes up to him and asks him for menus. We order food and drinks and still again we had to walk up to the bar to order. My friend became our server.,0
"I gotta say, I might be the only one, but I just wasn't that blown away with this place.  Having just moved to the area, I was very excited to find out we had a sushi joint within a mile of our home.  I was even more excited when I read the other reviews on here.  Of course, no one reviewed the sushi yet.\n\nWe has been in the pool all day and were looking for something that we could bring back home.  We stopped in, grabbed a sushi menu and headed for the waiting area framed by this amazing crystal dragon.  We spent about 5 minutes just discussing this dragon and how much we wanted to touch it but were sure we would ruin it and the Tottie's SWAT would come looking for us.  After reviewing the menu I noticed that the selection was much smaller than some other places.  We opted for 4 rolls and salmon nigiri.  We waited around for awhile and I think the hostesses forgot about us because they finally walked back to check on someone else, saw me and said Oh!  You're sushi is ready at the front.  We grab it, pay $42 and head home - less than 2 minutes.\n\nI get home to see that the sushi is small - smaller than what you get at the grocery store with very very little actual fish in it.  The avocado was turning slightly brown (probably from the wait up front) and it just didn't make me say Wow at all.  We ate it (well, most of it) because we were hungry but I have to say I don't think I will be getting sushi from there again.  Maybe it was an off night, I just wouldn't recommend it.  Expecially not for that price.  I would have been better going off to Ra.  \n\nHowever, its cute inside and I like the crystal dragon so they get 2 stars.  Maybe I'll go back sometime and try some of the other food people are raving about.",1
"I was really craving dol-sot bibbimbap. and was told by a friend this is the only place that offers it in pittsburgh. Dol Sot Bibbimbap and regular bibbimbap are different - fyi. In terms of the interior: it looked really clean and modern. Not a whole lot of tables. I would say there were only around 8 tables. Some of them had sofa chairs instead of regular chairs. \n\nOn fridays, there's even karaoke offered but not sure how much it costs. \n\nThe side dishes were fine and they refilled them upon request. The dinner prices are really high for Korean food, but I'm biased since I grew up in LA where Korean food is much cheaper. \n\nOverall, the dol sot bibimbap was really cleanly/nicely done. The rice wasn't burned on the bottom and the veggies were abundant. But for dinner it cost almost $18. That's really steep for dol-sot bibbimbap in my opinion. \n\nI was really impressed that I came with my 16 month old daughter, and the server immediately brought out a Pororo bowl and small baby cup for her. It's also nice when a restaurant is able to cater to the little ones.",3
This is our third time eating here but the first since the remodel and it was great. They seem to still be working on some of the decor but it was very clean which I appreciate. The food is always organized nicely and clean. My daughter loves to be able to pick her own items. The soup bar is a lot larger then before. The noodles are probably the only area that my family did not like but that was okay because there was so many other yummy things!,3
"I rode this shuttle to Vegas for less than a $100. The driver was courteous and well-trained,  and pointed out scenery and landmarks along the way. It ran on time, and was clean and comfortable. I will definitely use them again.",4
"It's a Dollar Tree, so I really didn't have high expectations going in, and I'm wasn't overly disappointed.  It's loosely organized, mostly stocked, and staff are rare except to check out.  Not a big selection of items, but again it's a Dollar Store, not Target or Walgreens.  I don't typically shop here, and just went in with my wife looking for a particular item (large nail clippers), which they didn't have in stock at the time.  I do appreciate that they actually stick to the $1 price tag, versus other \""dollar\"" stores that do not.",2
"On the way back from checking out a house for sale, the smells wafting in from the pizzerias were overwhelming. We made a U-turn and parked on the street across from this spot. The Mediterranean pasta was good, just like the service. Not life changing, but still good. My friend really fancied the mild wings. We enjoyed some Doctor Oz ironically playing on their flat screen. My dish was big (it turned into 2-3 meals for me) and I was served a nice piece of garlic bread, sliced. They have a good selection of drinks, among the normal ever so mundane pop, Arizona tea, and gatorade.  The reason for 3 stars is because the meal was just okay, but what you would expect from a pizzeria. There weren't any napkins around and my friend (who was munching on saucy wings) had to ask for some mid-meal.",2
"God, after all the burritos, tortitos, empanodos, mosquitos and other disgusting mex food in Phoenix, this place was a breath of fresh air - especially since it's so close by to where I live. I've never really had Polish food before and the food here is hearty and delicious. I've eaten here a number of times, and mainly used to get their giant Polish King's Feast (cabbage roll, kielbasa, 3x pierogies, \""hunter's stew\"" and bread), but now my favourite is the kiszka (blood sausage). No, trust me, it's delicious! Their red cabbage is absolutely awesome, and actually kind of \""sweet\""-tasting.\n\nFood prepared promptly, a bit pricey but not over the top (worth it for the flavours). Place is kind of a hole in the wall but there's a lot of stuff in here. You can dine-in (about six or seven tables all up) or take out, and they have a deli counter with a billion Polish meats/sausages, plus some Polish grog (bizarre, large, ornate bottles) and Okocim beer, chocolates like \""rum kocke\"" (a condition I've suffered from on occasion) etc. Used to be run by a dude and his wife, but apparently Grandpa now works there and Grandpa don't understand English too well. I still managed to sign-language my order to him and the blood sausage was just as delicious as ever.\n\nOldies cram into this place in the evenings so get there early (er, wait a minute - on second thought, get there after 6:30p and they'll probably all be gone) or just do the take-out thing. If you've never eaten here and you're in the area, you really need to try it. I'd go for the cabbage roll with creamy tomato sauce (per Melissa H's recommendation), and if there's two of you get their potato pancakes with apple sauce. Way too much potato for one person but delightful at least for the first several dozen bites.\n\nThen get the kiszka with mash potato and red cabbage on your next visit. This dish has made it to the top ten fave meals I've ever had in Arizona. Doesn't taste like blood, I promise.\n\nThen try the sandwiches.. you almost need a flip-top head to take a bite out of them, they're piled pretty high. They have regular stuff there, ham etc, and also headcheese.. yummo. Just a great little place to have dinner at, despite being a bit cramped and the newspapers being all in Polish. Sorry, I don't speak or read shish-nish.\n\nEdit: One last thing I forgot to mention. This place has some real crappy business hours. Only open until 6pm on some days, 8pm on others. Ridiculous. AND, there have been times when I've gotten there at 7:45pm on an 8pm night, only to find the place already closed up - I looked in the window and spotted the staff standing at the register gloating and chuckling like Gollum at the day's takings. Other times, they've had a sign up \""closed for 2 weeks for spring vacation\"" - what the? It appears they don't mind closing up shop on a whim so the other thing to be aware of is that if you go, don't be surprised if they're closed because one of the staff ran out of toothpaste or broke a fingernail.. (mutters under breath)",3
I went through the fast care at this location and it was great. I was In and Out. The doctors answer all your questions. They are very helpful if you come in with multiple problems. I came in for eczema and also left with an allergy shot.,4
"WAY overpriced and really run of the mill pizza, found the crust to be tasteless and boring and really feel ho hum about the whole meal including the hummus.  The beers were the stars here and if that is what your coming for then you wont be disappointed,  had the orange blossom and it was nothing like I have ever tasted before.  Our waitress was great and brought us several rounds of samples of the beers.  over all just OK and we probably wont go back again. We had two small pizzas one of them cheese the hummus and we each had a beer and it was over $50, Oh and if you sit inside be prepared for very loud music,  we walked in to ACDC highway to hell rocking the house, think yard house loud so if you want to talk or even think you might have a problem.",1
Swanky outdoor shopping plaza. Loved Sur La Table and the Vic's Secret. Nice grounds and fun to stroll around while enjoying a Starbucks. Trying to park was horrendous though!,3
"The only reason I can think of for these 5-star reviews of this restaurant is that people were DRUNK when they wrote it. This deli is by far the most OVERPRICED and HORRIBLE food I have ever eaten.  And I am from Los Angeles where we have EXPENSIVE DELIs.  Their Matzo Ball soup tasted like dish water, and their corned beef was COMPLETELY dry.  They charge $16.99 for a lousy corned beef sandwhich with NOTHING on the side, and they have the audacity to charge you a $3.00 sharing fee on top of it.  $20 for a lousy sandwich with nothing on the side.  Even in Beverly Hills, I can get a sanwich and french fries for $15.   NEVER AGAIN!",0
"Its unfortunate that this is the cafe in the Palazzo. We went twice on our most recent trip and both experiences were terrible. \n\nTheir breakfast buffet is a pretty good deal, $16 including juice and coffee. The food for the buffet was completely average. I ordered a hot chocolate in addition to my juice and while it looked absolutely amazing it had absolutely no flavor. The worst part of the experience was the incredibly slow service that we had to endure. \n\nOur second trip was a late night trip for something in our bellies to sop up everything we had been drinking that night. My eggs were predictable, but my husband's sandwich was so incredibly salty that he could not eat it. In addition, the saltiness combined with the copious amounts of alcohol did not make for a happy scenario the next morning. \n\nFor breakfast or brunch head to Morels. For late night eats go over to Noodles Asia in the Venetian or dare I say it...walk down the street to Denny's.",1
"Went to Vegas and stayed at Palazzo... I was searching for a good restaurant and noticed this was a Wolfgang Puck restaurant, so we decided to go here, we knew we wouldn't be disappointed. I ordered the calamari (it was an appetizer, I chose to eat it as my main meal), it was ok... not much flavor, but there were peppers all over the place, which gave it some sort of taste. I've definitely had better calamari elsewhere.. wouldn't recommend it. For dessert... I ordered the chocolate beignet's... loved them- a taste of heaven! Rich, moist, and fresh, and the ice cream they served with it made it even better! So I would definitely recommend that for you chocolate lovers out there! The ambiance was nice... and we were seated outside (not really outside but  they considered it patio seating) so we got to enjoy the entertainment that was going on... which was probably the best part about dinner!",2
"Been here three times. Every time, service is great, fast, courteous, and attentive. Ceasar is a very nice guy. Last night he took the extra time to explain things for me. I appreciate the attention. Every time we come we try one new thing. We always get tacos though!!! The soft tacos are AMAZING!!! The hard shell tacos are huge, but just as good. My husband says he could drink the salsa with a straw. Last night we ordered a \""torta\"" this is a Mexican style sandwich. Beans, your choice of meat, Pico, lettuce, tomato, guacamole, layered on a hoagie style roll that has been grilled. The \""torta\"" is not for me. My husband loved it. The asada fries are my personal favorite! Get them with carnitas, CARNITAS ON EVERYTHING!!!",4
"After driving by everyday for months I finally stopped in for a sub and was completely unimpressed. Even though the shop was nearly empty, the staff was indifferent and they forgot what I ordered multiple times.\n\nThe chicken parm sub I ordered was a hot bland mess. Instead of crispy breaded chicken inside, it had plain unseasoned chicken slices which was covered in cheese and a sauce one step away from ketchup. To top it all off the sub was microwaved, which made the inside insanely hot and turned to bread to rubber.\n\nMaybe their regulars subs are better, but the next time I spend $10 on a sub and soda, it definitely won't be here.",0
"I wish I could give this place more stars because the food is delicious, but the service is terrible!\n\nI brought several people to this establishment to have lunch or dinner  over the last few months and the service is typically a 5. Never once has the server been attentive! One time, on a late business lunch, we watched our server sit at a few tables away and completely ignore our stares for the check. We literally waited half an hour as she chatted with other patrons. It was quite annoying to say the least, tips are earned not required! I mean come on! To this day she eyes me down when I come in for pick-up.\n\nThe Chicken Katsu is the best item on the menu! I would definitely order take-out, at least you can rely on that service. Very nice lady at the front!",2
"What do they serve at Lobster Me?  LOBSTER!  This place is located in the Venetian on the second floor near the escalators near the floors 1-16 elevators.  Their menu consists of lobster rolls, lobster claws, lobster tacos, lobster mac and cheese, lobster grilled cheese, soups and hot dogs.  I ordered the lobster grilled cheese and it was quite tasty.  They added a good portion of lobster in the grilled cheese.  The prices are high and the size of the rolls are a little small but then again it's lobster.  You order your food, get a number, and find a table so this is more of a fast food theme restaurant.",2
Our regular theatre.  Always clean and comfortable.  Saw The Giver today and were 2 or 4 viewers!  The staff is always helpful and nice.  We appreciate the location and typically plenty of parking.  We always have our souvenir cup to get a reasonable soda.,4
"Oh so much disappointment. This is for both South Park and Uptown locations. Let me add Im a club member and have frequented this chain in other states with much better service. \nA simply arugula salad w shrimp was overcooked and took almost 30 minutes to get to me. \nI spent THREE hours at the South Park location (unwillingly) waiting for my and two others birthday celebrations. the not-even-melted Brie appetizer was served at room temperature french bread (this was supposed to be toasted) with over-cooked shrimp. All FIVE meals were served at varying degrees of room temperature, over cooked or the plate was burning hot from being under the heat lamp for too long. Did I mention how loooong it took for this inedible food to get to us?? I gave up keeping track of time after 45 minutes. After the manager was involved in this beyond frustrating \""meal\"" she comped the desserts we had already intended on getting (birthdays) but never came back to check on us. Did I also mention they botched a lobster tail TWICE? \n(Feel free to  check my other reviews and you'll see I'm fair with my reviews, this is not the rant of a bratty diner who wanted something for free - both visits were just That Bad!)",1
"This is the old JT Whitney's. It was decent when it was JT Whitney's and now....well, it had potential but failed to deliver.\n\nAfter a day or errands and hearing that Vintage had opened where the old JT Whitney's was, we decided to try out the new place.  Upon walking in it was nice inside.  They did a great job with the re-model and the place was welcoming and nice.\n\nWe were seated immediately and it was great to see a place that brews their own beer had some other beers as well.  PBR IN A CAN!!!!\n\nWe opened our menus and almost walked out at that point.  what a limited list of crap!  Here is what you can get...burger that probably is the same ol crap burger (aka: Great Dane), some sandwiches with no meat, salad, soup, and some sort of fish sandwich.  So, the menu have no variety at all and unless you are vegetarian or want a burger, you will not like the food at this place.\n\nWe decided not to be rude and walk out and get a few appetizers because NOTHING on the menu looked good to us at all.  We got Cheese Curds and Nachos.   The cheese curds were typical and not great and the Nachos were good but nothing I would want again.\n\nThe Vintage Brewing Company is not worth my time ever again.  Oh yeah, our waiter was not helpful at all and also did not know provolone was a cheese and not a meat.",0
"This is my go to Friday night HH place!  The food is amazing, the staff is awesome and the fun is unending!  Michelle and Zach (bartenders) are on top of it and make some of the best drinks ever!  Christo, the GM, is awesome in that he always stops by to say Hi and make sure everything is OK when we come in.  \n\nThe food, oh, the food.  My favorite is  actually an appetizer , the steak potato skins, the flavor mix that the chef created is amazing!   The steaks are awesome and you can't get better a better steak for the price anywhere on the Strip. The HH tacos and ribs are to die for and a great deal for HH.  \n\nThey have a 'patio' area just off the bar that is out in the casino area where you can order full menu and if want to, smoke.  The inside bar and restaurant are smoke free.\n\nI highly recommend dinner at McCall's, even if not staying at the Stratosphere.",4
"Ridiculous!!!  Tried to order the family box;  you get 1 topping per pizza. I wanted cheese for 1 of my pizzas, and 2 toppings on my other pizza... Said they couldn't do that. The computer wouldn't let them. I'd have to pay for the 2nd topping. Does that even make sense?  Now they aren't getting my $25 order!!!  All for a topping!!!",0
"Old world Italian at it's finest. Screw the on-strip fancy pants joints, if you want a taste of what it's like dining in an old-school Mafia style Italian eatery, this is your joint. \n\nExposed brick, colored Christmas lights, live music (or singer I should say), classic Vegas photos on the wall and a more than friendly staff to ensure your experience is fantastic. \n\nThe food (in my humble opinion) was DELICIOUS, however I feel they are a bit heavy on the price tag (hence the star short of perfection). I mean, let's be real, for $19 I could make eggplant parm for an army, ha ha! \n\nPerfect date place, dim lighting, great ambiance (as you've read in most of my reviews, ambiance is extremely important to me..makes the food taste better), and a friendly staff. \n\nI celebrated a big birthday this year and courtesy of some pretty amazing people choosing this venue, I had the BEST time! \n\nCheck out Casa Di Amore for a swanky night out on the town with your guy or gal..totally worth the experience.",3
"Gah, I hate being the odd man out, but my experience at Reuben's could have been better. Maybe it's because I was using it as a point of comparison to Schwartz's (http://www.yelp.com/biz/schwartzs-montr%C3%A9al-2?hrid=Q8flys8gSE-nfufggVNbfA#src:self), but I can't quite say with confidence that a trip to Reuben's is worth going out of your way. \n\nStar 1: How were the service and atmosphere?\n\nNow, one thing I will say is that Reuben's is designed to funnel large quantities of people even on the busiest of days. You're sitting here in the most touristy part of town, so you're already in the zone for a crowd, but Reuben's will have you seated quickly. The menu? Colossal, and even the most picky eaters will find something that suits them. In my case, the bartender was pleasant and attentive without being overbearing. Star Granted. \n\nStar 2: How were the portions relative to the cost?\n\nSure, my smoked meat sandwich at nearby Schwartz's was half the cost of my $16.00 smoked meat sandwich here at Reuben's, but it was also half the sandwich. Have a look at this beast:\n\nhttp://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?userid=OKX-V5j_qfuOebeHeWGrHg&select=PNYh4OrGamAwGQiZsHlyyA\n\nThat's easily two sandwiches and two portions of fries. For $16.00? That's fair. Star Granted. \n\nStars 3 and 4: How was the food?\n\nAnd herein came the problem. Reuben's can do it all, as is evident by their menu, but what that often leads to is everything being done not quite to the optimal standard. Case in point was my sandwich, which, to be honest, wasn't all that good. The smoked meat must have been slow cooked in a crock pot as opposed to smoked because the whole thing was so overcooked that it fell apart into a bit of a salty mush. Combined with standard bread, standard, boring fries, and a pickle, and I honestly wasn't too keen to the point where I didn't even finish the meal. Up the quality of the meat, up the quality of the bread, and up the quality of the fries, and you'd have a brilliant sandwich. In the meantime? I wasn't a fan. No Stars Granted. \n\nStar 5: Would you eat here every day if you could?\n\nSchwartz's is better head to toe when it comes to smoked meat sandwiches. No Star Granted.",1
Mannnn I wanted to LOVE THIS PLACE!!! The only thing I loved was the tempura shrimp and red bean ice cream!!! I went here when it was 120 degrees just to try out the place and boy was I disappointed.. I won't come to this place for sushi because they didn't offer my kind of sushi (I don't eat raw seafood). so sad so sad.,1
"Kabuki, I was pleasantly surprised!  \n\nWe ordered quite a bit on the menu, and I can't say I was disappointed with anything!\n\nGarlic Edamame ($4.95): Sauteed with Sea Salt and Garlic. This was very garlicky and delicious! Loved the bits of crunchy garlic...one of the better versions I've had actually :P\n\nYakibuta ($6.95): Pork, Jalapeno, and Green Onions. Wish it was a little more tender, but the flavor was good.  Looks like pork belly, but it isn't as fatty or tender as belly.\n\nOmakase Deluxe ($13.95): Tuna, Salmon, Yellowtail, Shrimp, Albacore & Spicy Tuna Roll. SURPRISINGLY GOOD quality nigiri here! I didn't think this would fill me up, but with the appetizers and sides, I left stuffed.  \n\nI would come here again if I am hungry in Town Square :)",3
"By far the BEST sushi EVER, always fresh, friendly and a great atmosphere. It's my go to spot.",3
best hidden gem in chinatown.,4
"I'm a big fan of FIB'S - Fine Italian Beef.  The food is great and the cart brings back memories of time spent in Chicago.  The meatball sub is the best I've ever had and a fellow worker, who's a professed chili hot dog expert says that FIB'S chili dog is the best she's had.\n\nI recently found out that the owner of the cart donates to local homeless shelters quite often.  Wonderful !",4
"I'm from LA, which has some of the best Japanese food in the USA.  Even so, I find the food at Sushi-Ko amazing.  I especially love the tender Filet Mignon at the Teppan station and the Sushi Ko rice from the sushi bar.  The specials tend to be really good too.  I just had their \""Zig Zag\"" handroll, and it was awesome.  I also always get the Jalapeno Super White Tuna Sashimi whenever I come here.\nThe boss of this restaurant, Fred, is a very friendly individual.  It was odd, but he remembered me after a couple of visits.  Love the service, love the food.  Great Sushi, Teppan, and the standard kitchen foods.  Will definitely come again!",4
"Haji-Baba al-maTaar al-akbar.\n\nBecause my husband is good to me, he treated me to Haji-Baba again. We got there at 11:00 sharp and we were the first customers of the day. Right after we sat down is when the parking lot started to fill up. That's how you handle the customer volume. \n\nI ordered tabooli salad, yogurt salad and falafel. I've since tried falafel elsewhere and it's still the best at Haji-Baba. They're generous with the tahini sauce. \n\nFinally, explored the little shop to the side and there are lots of little Christmas stocking stuffers here (hint - Turkish delight for a mere $5). One of these days...",4
I came here on a Friday night with a restaurants.com coupon. Just a side note on the coupon it will say you have to spend $35.00 but on a Friday night they want you to spend $40.00. My husband wanted to get up and leave because of it . I just gave him a look like we didn't drive all the way here just to go back over $5.00! The money we were spending was like free money anyways because we won a little bit gambling . We'd rather put the winnings in our belly rather than back in the machine. \n\nI'm glad we stayed because the food was terrific! We started off with the Thai Beef Jerky. I've only tried this once before at Ocha on Las Vegas Blvd and I can say the Jerky here was more tender. We had the Thai Beef salad which was equal to all of the other places in town we have tried. The Pineapple Fried rice was good but I still prefer Archi's. We also had the Pad Thai which was good and they give HUGE portions! We ended with the fried bananas that I didn't want to order. When I was a child that was my mom's idea of dessert and I just go tired of it. I was surprised when I actually liked it . The combination of the fried bananas and vanilla ice cream was awesome! \n\nIt was worth the couple of miles of drive time to get here the food was fresh and tasty!,3
"If it was possible, I would also give OnTrac negative stars. We placed a few different orders through Amazon to take advantage of the Black Friday and Cyber Monday sales. I didn't realize that Amazon Prime defaults to OnTrac for their two-day shipping.    We will be immediately canceling Prime. We live in San Jose.\n\nWe had two different shipments placed within the same order from Amazon and they were due to arrive on Wednesday and Friday--we didn't receive either package. When we tracked the package the site said 'In Transit'. I called OnTrac this morning and told the rep about the problem. She told me that one package was lost. Yes, they actually freakin' lost a package. It was a 43lb surround sound speaker set. Yeah, that's easy to lose. I was told the other package was delivered on Wednesday and signed by FD. This means they left it at the front door. Amazon is reshipping this item and will probably end up replacing the speaker set as well. \n\nWe are a little nervous about the other items we ordered today. They are Christmas presents for the kids and I have very little confidence we will actually receive them. Why on earth Amazon has a contract with OnTrac is beyond me. They are not reliable and make Amazon look really, really bad!",0
"This is a brand new McDonald's right next to Lush Burger and AJ's.  This place is either understaffed, or poorly trained.  I have eaten breakfast (on a weekday, 9am) and lunch (noon on a Saturday) and both times the place was dirty.  Counters, soda area, floor, all looked like they hadn't been cleaned in a day or two.  \n\nThis is too bad, as this is a brand new place.  \n\nService was slow, and unhappy.  My food orders (both meals) were wrong.  \n\nThis shouldn't be a big suprise if they are owned by the same people that own FLW & 101.",1
"The buffet at Caesar Palace is kind of mediocre. I have heard raving reviews about the newly remodeled buffet and decided to try it out.\n\nCame here on Monday for their lunch buffet. The cost was 35.99 plus tax, which is typical of Vegas buffets. The selection of food was okay, but most of the food was lukewarm or dried out which is strange when the place was packed.  \n\nThe layout of the buffet was also strange as it snakes around and people just stay near the front where the seafood and meats are. The lines for the meats and tacos were long and people blocked the food near there so the baked potatoes and other foods near the area were untouched.  \nThe prime rib and brisket were overly salty but compared to everything else, it was decent.\nThe seafood was also decent and but the selection wasn't that great.\n\nOur server was also never around so there was always a lack of drinks. \n\nOverall. It was mediocre at best. Expectations were not met",1
"I heard good things about Diego's Happy Hour & had it in my radar for awhile, only thing keeping me from coming sooner is, as with all restaurants in the MGM it's not easy to get to them, parking in the garage, then walking through the Star Lane Shops, then the casino, then the long hallway through restaurant row. Well it was Memorial Day weekend & a friend and I were feeling motivated to make the trek. I had called ahead to make sure they were still doing Happy Hour on Sundays, I spoke with a really nice hostess who informed me they were actually doing Happy Hour from 2-5:30 (normal HH is 4-5:30) in honor of Memorial Day. We got there at 4, sat down at the bar and asked for a HH menu, the bartender says \""my mgr stopped HH at 4\"" I told him that I had just called and spoke with a hostess who informed me differently. He replied \"" do you want to take it up with my mgr\"" I said sure. So he leaves to go get the mgr, when he returns he says to us \""I don't feel like chasing  him around so I guess I will just honor it\"" and proceeds to toss us a menu. I notice only drinks on the menu and I asked if there was a food HH menu, he said no, I showed him a picture of the online HH menu from their website and he just shrugged his shoulders and said \""I don't know\"". From this point on he was a complete jerk to us. Cesar is his name. He acted like we were a bother to him. He would speak Spanish to the other bartender, in front of us, which is totally unprofessional. We ended up ordering a pitcher of margaritas, which weren't good at all, and some nachos that made up for the margaritas, but for $12 they should be good as the portion was small. \n\nI have no tolerance for people who are in the customer service industry and act like this. You are a bartender. I get we all have bad days, but no excuse to be total jerk to your customers. You lost two customers and I will for sure tell my friends to avoid this place.",0

"Restaurant/bar that used to be a church.  Mmm... sacrilicious.\n\nmiss l's review is right on - beer is pretty tasty, the spinach/cheese artichoke dip is great, i don't think i had anything else to eat.... i'm sure locals come here somewhat regularly but def. the kind of novelty place you're sure to find visitors esp. on weekends.  like me.",3
"Friends, let's be completely honest about the ding dong chicken.  It was sub par to say the least!   Before even getting to the ultimate fail of the peanut butter, the chicken \""pattie\"" and cafeteria-like white bun really deflated any chance of this being worth it's cost.  Both were clearly mass produced, frozen, thawed, warmed and slopped on a plate after being cooked in an admittedly decent array of spices.  The only reason I ordered this particular sando was to partake on a thai like peanut/spice journey and to take my first bite and arrive with a thick schtick of crunchy Jif on the roof of my mouth couldn't have pissed me off more.  This sandwich seriously had potential, but it's like someone gave up along the way and settled for \""this will do\"".\nThat being said, I'm willing to give the joint another shot for two reasons:\n1.  The white bean hummus was tasty.\n2.  They were giving away free beer in lieu of not having secured their ABC permit.\nI sincerely hope this place makes it b/c it's great for the neighborhood, but I feel there are some menu offerings that need to step it up a notch.",1
We had the Sunday Buffet.  It was terrible. The food was terrible and there was one guy running the place who kept going outside.  So much Incense burning as you walk in too.  One of the worst restaurants I have ever eaten at. My husband liked the lamb curry so it got one star for that.,1
"I used to live near this Gogo a few years back. At the time I thought it was the best Chinese take out in Las Vegas. I moved away and  now Im back in the area, so I was excited to be able to order from this particular Gogo. \nUpdate. The driver remembered me, so that was real nice. He was always personable.\nThe food quality and taste where not what they used to be. I order the Twice spicy cooked chicken and it was over run with hot red peppers to the point it was almost inedible. The bbq fried rice was awesome though. \nThe next week I ordered mushu chicken. It was more like mushu chicken soup. I wound up putting the whole container in a colander to drain all the excess liquid. I wasn't happy at all. \nI gave Gogo one more chance after that, hoping they just had a bad night two (its real hard to find decent Chinese food out here). I kept my fingers crossed.\nI was heart broken. I ordered fried wontons, bbq sliced pork, and chicken with broccoli.\nThe fried wontons were not crispy, in fact they were very soggy and mushy. The bbq sliced pork was like chewing leather . After eating 4 pieces I had to throw it out. The chicken and broccoli had so much ginger in it. It tasted like I was eating soap. \nI will not be eating from here again.\nThank you, and good night.",0
Food was great and the service is amazing. Staff is so friendly I would come just because of them! I had the mamas sandwich and it was perfect for lunch. Big portion so I gave half to my coworker and she loved it too. Glad to have found this place!,4
"Bachi Burger has become somewhat of a tradition for us. Every trip to Vegas includes a visit to Bachi Burger. The burgers are delicious and very affordable. On this particular trip I had:\n\nMiyagi-San Burger -- This probably my favorite burger here. Wagyu grass feed beef, topped with a friend eggs, onion rings, and caramelized bacon. It also has a wonderful sweet glaze on the patty. Delicious!!\n\nKiki's Burger -- Also a great burger! I was trying to eat something a little healthier so a friend and I did halfsies on the Kiki and the Myagi-San. The Kiki is topped with caramelized ones and an array of mushrooms.\n\nOxtail Chili Cheese Fries -- These chili cheese fries are great. Oxtail chili served a top fries with Cheese, fried egg and jalapenos. These are always so yummy, but probably not too healthy to eat too often. Our table shared one order, but I can definitely eat the entire thing myself.\n\nNow for the best part of my review (drum roll please)..............\n\nAfter having spoke to the owner it turns out Bachi Burger is coming to LA!!! I was very excited to hear this. My friends and I have been talking about how great it would be if Bachi were closer. Expect them to open up sometime in the fall. I can't wait! I better start buying my pants one size larger, because I'm going to need them. =P",4
"Revisited Leatherman for the driving range and found it to be alright for using the driving range. Thankfully they still offer a BOGO bucket of balls in the Entertainment Book, so we ventured back. i steered clear of the mini golf course so i couldn't tell you if that has improved any. But 2 buckets of balls for the price of one, that's a-ok.",2
"I went to Khristine today and I absolutely love my haircut! I have lived in the valley for 7 years and until now, I've never trusted anyone enough to do more than a trim. Khristine is awesome! She definitely knows her stuff and I'm even considering getting highlights again after a five year color hiatus (because I never found someone I could trust to do it, until now!).  Awesome, awesome stylist!",4
"Unfortunately, I can't agree with the other reviewers here.  I have taken my animals here for a few years, and I will be finding a new vet ASAP.  The prices here are higher than vets in other parts of the East Valley (probably on par for Scottsdale though).  The biggest problem I have is the high-pressure sales pitch I get every time I go in...even if it's just to buy cat food.  On my last visit, I was asked 3 times if \""I was sure\"" I didn't want to buy their $600 \""wellness plan\"" for my cat.  When I explain that I simply can't afford these things, I just get looks of reproach and end up feeling like I'm a bad pet owner.  In addition, they tend to hold you hostage here on prescription items.  On more than one occasion I've gone to get a refill of Heart Guard or prescription food (mind you it's a 30 minute drive for me) and been told I can't have it until they see my pet for some mystery appointment that they suddenly need even thought they are up-to-date on their exams/check-ups.  Last straw was when they refused to honor a coupon that I had printed off of their website the day before because they forgot to put  \""for new patients only\"" on the coupon or anywhere on the website.  I'm done with this place, but if it works for you, great!",0
"Me and my husband had hot cocoa, quiche lorraine and vegetable croissant today. First time at this coffee shop and we were  dissapointed. I think we wasted our time and money. We like the ambiance, sandwich tasted really fresh but flavor and taste so with the quiche was very ordinary. I know Einstein and Panera bread was a whole lot better for 1/2 or 1/3 of the price. Hot cocoa was very good though. Im not satisfied with service of the barrista. They find my order of hot cocoa confusing  and theyre making fun of it within my hearing range. I believe that was rude. Am not going back there though i live around the neighborhood!",1
"Never had bad food or service but that was not the case at this location. \n\nWent in today for lunch. Ordered the Spicy Thai Chicken Salad and tea. \n\nThe server brought us our drinks but not all together. With very little ice, it was the only tea I drank, never asked about a refill. \n\nWe had to ask for a bread basket, which the flat bread was burnt. I'm surprised it was served to us, I know the guy dishing it out could tell, not sure why he still put it on the plate. \n\nMy salad came - appeared nice. Unfortunately the chicken was dry and there was no spice. The dressing is like a sour viniagrette, no kick there or really that much flavor.. then after digging into the salad, notice a lot of the lettuce had better days earlier that week. \n\nFinally saw the server again, we asked for the bill. \nWill try it out again, most likely another location.",1
"I've been a Pete's fan for over 45 years going back to the days of fresh cut fries and long slender crunchy shrimp.  For a quarter you could get two fish sandwiches.  I remember the patties being thicker with more fish and less breading. Pete's restaurant chain began changing their signature offerings sometime in the 1980's. I was a Pete's addict so I rolled with the punches. The price and the red sauce will hook you in. This being said this store has taking an all time low. What's with the little flat over cooked dry shrimp nuggets, terrible.  Maybe a little salt to bring out the flavors will help. After  all these years I am looking for a new deep fried seafood fast food restaurant.",0
"This place is great!  I have been there for both lunch and breakfast.  Food is larger portion and great.  As everyone has said, the coffee cake is to die for.  Service is good.  Never had a bad time here for meals or service.",3
"I recently went by the Daily Press for the first time. I heard good things and since I just moved to the hood I wanted to check it out. I'm glad that I did. I stopped while I was in the middle of a run. The barista welcomed me when I came in and was very friendly (especially considering I was really sweaty at the time.)\n\nShe got me a glass of water, then made one of the best lattes I've ever had. It was amazing, including some cool latte art. It hit the spot.\n\nAtmosphere: It's in the same building as the Evening Muse, so you get a very cool vibe walking in. Not too crowded, unlike a lot of coffee houses. Cozy.\n\nOverall, I give the Daily Press 5 stars!",4
My husband did not enjoy the spicy ramen. Maybe had three small pieces of pork. I thought the miso ramen was alright. We also had the chasu bowl. The pork was sweet and there was very little in the bowl. Won't be trying that again. \nMonta ramen it still Las Vegas's best ramen!,1
Went for lunch  closed   All signs are off the building no notice. What happened?   Pfft gone!,0
"I went here on the way to the airport for Thanksgiving.  The guy in front of me was having a conversation with the cashier ringing up the orders (very inconvenient), so I voiced my concern and demanded their sense of urgency.  Had they not responded to it, I would've given them 2 or 3 stars.  The fact that they went right ahead and helped their customers is pretty awesome.  It's hard to ditch a regular who is trying to schmooze with the employees, and they are very friendly people who work at Einstein.\n\nI get the Nova Lox Everything bagel--it's lox, cream cheese, tomatoes, onions, capers (you can easily take them off haha) on an everything bagel.  Yum.  It's too bad it's like SEVEN BUCKS!  But, it's worth it!",3
"Amazing, all the products that I have tried have been wonderful and the staff very helpful.",4
"Our team from work came here for lunch.  It is my first time!  After all these years, I finally made it inside for some food.  I selected off the lunch menu (quite a selection for lunch).  I ordered the Poco Pollo Con Queso.  It is a golden brown chicken chimichanga topped with two kinds of cheese.  It comes with rice and I got black beans.  YUM!  It was really good.  The refills are drinks were fast and you did not have to ask.  The only weird thing was they took our bowl for the chips away.  I thought they were refilling it, it never made it back to our table.  \n\nI agree with Jacob L. the deco was WAY over the top.  Almost touristy.",3
There are some pretty cool people at Frys right now. I don't remember all their names but a shout out to Pat at the register and Rebecca in the flower department. I forgot my rewards card...no problem. Questions about the beautiful flowers...no problem. Free Starbucks samples..YES. its a warm and helpful place to shop. Add cleanliness to that and I have to say Good Job to Frys Marketplace! Thank you!!!,3
"We are looking at Surprise Az. to retire to. We had a question about solar panels. So my wife called Leolinda to ask a specific question. Does Del Webb in this community allow solar panels on the roof?  This is a very simple question, the idea is that in the summer in Surprise, Az. people tend to run there air conditioners 7/24 for months due to the heat. Solar panels would help to keep the electric bill down. When my wife asked the question there was a complete dead silence then she said in a very nasty way, \""why would you want to put solar panels on your roof in the first place?.  If she is that stupid not to know the answer to that question she should stay out of the real estate business completely. We will not consider using her to buy our retirement home in Surprise and that is for sure!",0
"We tried this because it got good reviews. So we ordered to pick up, got the food back home, and each container had a ton of watery grease, the egg rolls were also full of grease. And the taste wasn't that great either, I felt like I could have gotten better food at panda express. One of the four people ended up with stomach problems the next day. The price was cheap but so was the food. I was expecting so much more.",0
Worst dentist I have been to! I came in for a check up and first they scheduled me at 3:45 pm when they close at 4pm. When he walked in he didn't say hi or any other greeting just asked for my name and read my X-rays. He then proceeded to tell me that I had a lot of cavities (I haven't been to a dentist in a while) and then he told me that I must like my candies and my soda! Yes I am a little over weight but that does not give anyone the right to look down or talk down to me. I walked out in tears and nobody in the office said a word to me after they took my copay. I will never go back to this dentist nor recommend this dentistry to ANYONE that I know!!,0
"Had my first vato  cigar here and got the sampler. Good beer, comfy seating and good ventilation. They don't have the beer and pizza special I read about on yelp, so prob just a beer and cigar stop.",3
"Very disappointed after hearing about SNS opening the only store in Arizona.  Ordered the original cheese burger with regular fries, for other type of fries, you would have to pay extra for it.  The only good thing coming out of this place is probably the Coke machine where you can mix different drinks together.  Other than that, you probably get better burgers at nearby fastfood joints.",1
"I came to The Olive Branch Bistro in Bruntsfield on Saturday at about 6pm with my mum.  From the menu outside it looked pretty expensive with with some mains costing over \u00a314, but we saw that we were just in time to get the two course lunch menu which came in at \u00a311.95 per person.  We were there before the earliest of their bookings for that evening and so we were easily seated and got quickly by the friendly French waiter.  I ordered the smoked chicken starter and the sausage and mash for a main which were both great tasting and pretty filling.  \nWhilst we waited, however, we could hear in meticulous detail the banter which the chefs and waitress were having in the kitchen.  It was pretty funny for a while but eventually started to get wearing.  \nThe food didn't take long to arrive and there was no doubt that it was great quality.  My mum ordered the ravioli for her main and, whilst the portion size seemed ridiculously small, she said it was great.\nThe Olive Branch is expensive, but despite the portions not being enormous it still offers excellent food and service to match its prices.",3
"I found this place on yelp because I had no interested in paying $125 for a massage!  At $34 for an hour, I thought how could it bad?  Especially with all the 5 star reviews.  I wish I had a 5 star experience.\n\nI came in my by myself and was walked to the back and told to sit in the chair and someone would be right with me.  I waited about 10 minutes before she came in (I wish I remembered her name) and pulled the ottoman from under my feet and came back a few minutes later with the plastic lined tub of hot water.  Ahhhhhhhh I was ready for my massage.  She did massaged my shoulders, my scalp, face, arms etc - but totally ruined the mood when she answered her cell phone, not once but twice during the hour I was there!!  God I hate cell phone abuse especially when I'm paying for a service.  \n\nWhen I turned over and she could do my back, twice she put extreme pressure on my tail bone causing much pain.  You'd think after I jumped and said something the first time, she'd avoid that area?  Her touch elsewhere was quite firm and it wasn't until the next day that I noticed 2 small bruises on the sides of my neck. :(  \n\nMaybe I'll be back, but I'll make a request for Rex who seems to have many fans here on yelp.  I love the price and the concept here, just had a bad experience with one of their masseuses.",1
"We literally have a computer graveyard in our garage at least 5 desktops, countless laptops and an iPad (SMH)...we didn't want to buy anymore so we decided to fix two laptops...hubs did a DIY replacing the screen to one himself...(he did a pretty good job!) the other laptop needed the adapter plug thingy fixed (I'm sooo not a techy). We are still pretty brand new to Las Vegas so we don't have any go to people to handle things like this. Hubs dropped the kids off at a nearby school and found this place...Well let me tell ya...they did a mighty fine job fixing it and debugging our laptop! They also added some software that works pretty awesome at keeping our laptop virus free :) They definitely know their stuff! I encourage you to bring your laptops and computers here to get fixed! Check-in and they might have an awesome deal available for you too!",4
"Sad that the B-Connected 5% off promo no longer works here. Well, it was good while it lasted. As such, it's not as cheap as ARCO, but still a pretty decent value when you need to fill up.",2
"Nice to be able to see a movie for under $10. (adult: $8.50, senior: $6, child: $6, matinee: $6) It may not be as updated as the bigger, newer, glitzier theaters in the area, but we still enjoy going here, especially for a Sunday matinee.\n\nWith 10 theaters, there's usually a decent movie selection. While I am not a frequenter of movie concession stands, it seems like they have all the basics.",3
"VIva is your typical Mexican restaurant; great food, fun music, and great service. It's family friendly and the menu has options for everyone.  I enjoyed my meal but I wouldn't consider it my favorite restaurant in town.",2
"How enchanting.\nA brown bag of french fries that before I can whisk them off to my table, has already saturated the bag with grease.\nAnd a double cheeseburger that after only two bites has fallen apart.\n\nI do like the soda dispenser, very unique, almost futuristic in a sense.\n\nIn the end, If I want to spend twenty five bucks for lunch for two of us, I'll go someplace where I'm not ingesting a half bucket of grease in the process. \n\nNote:  \nDon't go here before going to the movies. Your  body's grease-o-meter will be hitting red line, making you think twice about that bag of buttered popcorn.\n\nOr who knows, maybe you like grease.\nNot me.",1
"We decided to eat at The Florida Cafe because it was in our hotel. It took a while for us to get seated. The waitresses seemed off in their own world most of the time. We waited about 20 minutes before we even got our servers attention that we wanted to order. I thought the food was okay, but my husband loved what he got. When we needed refills, our waitress was nowhere to be found.",1
Upon hearing that there was a Nepali restaurant in the Northside I wanted to obviously give it a try. I however have not tried it. The photo of the menu on urban spoon apparently is wrong... this caused some confusion and as I tried to order the person on the phone became short with me and tried forcing me into a dish I did not want. I see the reviews and am sure the food is great but will never attempt to return due to the extremely poor attitude.,0
"I enjoyed it, although a tad expensive for what it's worth. Very scottsdale swanky.\n\nI got the bento box lunch special, which is a pretty neat japanese idea. They normally do it with children's lunches, but they expanded it out to adult portions at this restaraunt. You get a specialty roll, rice, miso soup, salad, ginger, wasabi, and a little pile of cabbage. Pretty tasty, but $15 for one roll and a few small sides was a little pricey for me. It took a little longer than I had hoped to get service, but their iced green tea was good.\n\nWould definitely go back, but only if I made the wrong turn accidentally and missed Teharu, the revolving sushi place a mile away.",2
"Tried the $15 New England Style lobster roll at the Vegas Foodie Fest - what a disappointment ! No flavor, unless you happen to bite upon a tiny piece of celery, and the lobster meat (if that's what it was) looked like imitation crab meat run through a shredder. Not a single chunk of discernible lobster meat. Don't know about the orange tarragon butter - tasted like they forgot the orange and the tarragon part. For $5 I would have chalked it up to just crappy food. For 15 bucks, it's ridiculous. Avoid !",0
"I normally really enjoy this restaurant. We get takeout from there pretty regularly and everything is usually pretty good. However, the last time we got takeout the entire order was messed up. I didn't receive an extra side item I ordered, and the two combo meals we got (both with 3 item choices) didn't have one correct item in them. We called to inform the store. The manager was nice and offered to send us a $30 gift card in place of a refund. That was over a month ago and we still haven't received anything. Very disappointing. The meal was over $30 plus a tip I left. When you eat at a restaurant they fix things for you, but when you order takeout you're at their mercy. You have to trust they got it right, or after you take the drive home you just have to eat whatever they gave you or take more time to drive back and wait for them to hopefully get it right again. I work in a restaurant and know mistakes happen. Also I'm not big on freebies or comps. But I do expect a restaurant to follow through when they offer something. If they didn't want to send the gift card they shouldn't have offered, and I would have driven back for an actual refund or replacement order. Now I probably won't be going back.",1
"Very good cooking.  I'm not familiar with Taiwanese fare but from the two times I've been there the chef does a good job with both meats and vegetables.  The menu is 75% hot/spicy for those faint of heart, flavors are strong but balanced.  I've eaten many styles of Chinese foods in the past and this style is very different but still very good.  My reservation of giving them a 5th star is not knowing the menu but I have time to tour the other items and then I'll update this review.  I had the Country Spare Ribs (because the \""motherland\"" couple next to me ordered it) it was terrific.",3
"Good food, good ambiance, great location!\n\nI went to this place a long time back when they first opened. The buffet spread then was not as extensive as some of the other Indian restaurants (e.g., Maharaja). However, what they lacked in food variety, they made up in taste and ambiance. And with its location on Monroe street, it's hard to go wrong with this choice.",3
"This is the first time we have been at a Good Egg in years.  There was not wait whatsoever and the place was packed on a Saturday morning.  I did not understand why they would charge  $1.50 for a small side of sour cream or horse radish sauce, this does not make sense.  The food was just okay nothing to write home about and their pancakes well a disappointment.  They are okay, but I usually like to eat my pancakes with just butter no syrup or honey, these were very dry and I can not cut them with just a fork needed a knife which speaks volumes....\n\nThe prices are good some low some high....the ladies bathroom has no a/c so prepare to sweat like a sauna if you use it.  We might go back to try for lunch...but the extra charge for the sour cream and other sauce left a bad taste in my mouth....maybe some of the other ones have better food.  the service was exceptional.",1
I can't speak for their cooked menu but the sushi is a disgrace here. I tried the most expensive roll - Las Vegas Roll for $18. It had no Nigiri and was full of imitation crab meat and what tasted like canned tuna.  My only mistake was finishing the roll instead of sending it back and walking away.  Manager offered no refund after I complained.  \n\nI'm literally astonished that they present this as upscale Sushi.,0
"Very impressive restaurant! We went on a Wednesday night and didn't need a reservation. There were still a lot of vacant tables. The hostess was very nice and gave us a table near the corner of the restaurant with a wonderful view of the Bellagio water show that came on every 15 minutes. It was beauutiful! \n\nThe wait was only about 10 minutes for them to clear the table so we sat at the bar and ordered their house Cabernet. Not bad.\n\nIt was a very romantic and fun experience. The food was pretty good too! I can't remember exactly what we ordered. I remember the Fillet was pretty good. Their bread is good. And the dessert, the souffle was pretty amazing too!\n\nIt's great for a nice date night! There's a photographer to take a picture of you and you can buy the keepsake with your photo in it.",3
"Ho-hum food, about like a Applebee's or Chili's. What I had was way too salty. Decent enough service.",1
"I recently ate here. At first, I was feeling great about the place. The restaurant had really good energy. The service was fast. The menu was really small. I ordered and the food was good. Nothing exceptional. But then I saw one of the cooks chewing as he was making a salad. I continued to watch him and sure enough he was popping lettuce into his mouth. He was eating part of the salad he was preparing for a customer. This really grossed me out. Shortly after eating here I got a stomach ache. I could only help but wonder if it was because of the poor health standards of this cook. He was a Hispanic male in his 30 s. I won't be returning any time soon.",2
UPDATE: I am incredibly taken back that the owner had the nerve to come on here in a sad attempt to discredit my honest review. I also find it funny that there is a review from the same week complaining of getting sick off the food and she's badgering that reviewer as well. Tacky business practice. Very tacky.,0
Loved the place!  Great cheerful people and FANTASTIC healthy sandwich and fruit....sooooo perfect!  Wireless internet too.,4
Waitress/bartender was a complete $#%ch.  Copped an attitude early and treated my wife and i like we were lepers.  Beer is all in bottles/cans - nothing on tap.  I thought the 80s and crappy beer selections were a thing of the past.  No food of any kind ... and no help from the wench behind the bar on finding local places that deliver.  Top it off with a voyeur owner that sits at home and watches the bar through remote cameras ... kind of creepy.  Too many good bars and eateries in this town to waste a dime on this ship wreck and its wenchy staff.,0
"I knew better than to expect greatness from this place, but I didn't care.  For all I knew this place could produce the best taco around.  What I found wasn't a hidden gem rather a typical ASU joint.  Everything is sticky and is just what you would expect from a bar on Mill.  The place is kinda funky, kinda douchy blah blah blah, yada yada yada.\n\nI'm still not sure why I chose this place for a regular evening dinner.  It wasn't horrible but it really is day/night-time drunk food type of place.  I had 2 tacos and they were ok.  Nothing special.  The chips and guac were also ok.\n\nIf I ever find myself on Mill during the night and it isn't too crowded I could see myself stopping in to have a drink.  However, I'm definitely heading to Filiberto's for my late night eating.\n\nThis place is worth trying but don't expect anything phenomenal.  And do yourself a favor and go to Local Dines and get a gift certificate ( http://bit.ly/dfR4eQ ).  Sure you might feel like an idiot going to a bar with a 1/2 price gift certificate but it will save you some cash and is totally worth it.",2
"I discovered the Jake burrito with brisket added is the best $13 burrito I've ever had. Yesterday I had the Carolina Crush, a 10 oz patty stacked with pulled pork and freshly chopped cole slaw. With the seasoned fries, it was amazing! Once again, my expectation were exceeded.",4
"Decent burger, nice bartender, no complaints.",2
"First, it's free.  While it's not as big as my favorite museums, I like the place being spacious, clean and, again, free.  It's a great place to learn about Scotland.  But if history is not your thing, consider it as a great place to get a break from the crowd and from the winter cold.",3
"huh. i would definitely not call this a \""scottsdale\"" type bar with that kind of crowd at all. i don't come often, but whenever i've gone it's been just good ol' beer drinking folk and/or the heavily tattooed crowd, and not skinny emo hipster tattooed... like\n\ngood meat and potatoes food, like bangers and mash, and englsih beers on tap like bass and such. service isn't spectacular. come to think of it, this bar is just so-so. i think i want to love it, cause it's a cool little pub, but it's just ok. yeah, you're better off going around the corner to papago.",2
"The massage was good.  But if you're looking for a \""full service\"" feeling this is mediocre at best.  The perfect word to describe it, is \""decent.\""  I'm on the phone with my sister talking about our experiences here (we both went at different times) and we're talking about how it's not bad, but when you want to spend money to relax and feel good about yourself, this doesn't accomplish the goal.  So... if you want a good/decent priced massage go.  If you want a \""spa day\"" keep looking.  I know I have to do better research and pay a whole lot extra for Camelback Inn or something like that.  They really need to clean it up, make it not look so old/dirty.  :( I hate saying that, but it's the truth.  Too much competition to look like that these days.",2
"Today, a colleague took me here for lunch.  I was surprised they had my favorite Italian dish--Chicken Francese.  \n\nWas it the best Chicken Francese I've ever had?  Nope.  Would I go there again?  Heck yeah!\n\nPositives:  The server was fantastic, food came out fast, the chicken was soft, the flavor was lemony but not overpoweringly so.  Best thing was the price.  Without tip, the bill was $23.70 for two drinks, two salads, and two entrees.  \n\nNegatives:  The bread does not come out first; it's on the entree plate.  There was very little sauce on the pasta.  Bad for me because I prefer butter or to dip my bread in olive oil or the sauce.  Seems nitpicky but these are the only negatives I could think of.",3
"My wife and I went here for my birthday.  Very nice place.  \n\nThe bread and olive paste they bring is very good (no surprise, given the name).  For an app, we had the margarita flatbread which was tasty.  My wife had the butternut squash tortelini.  She really liked and you can tell by the way the pasta was cut, it was made fresh (none of those predictable, pre-formed crescent shaped tortelini from a box).  I had the chicken and gnocci which was very good (and filling).  \n\nThey have a very good wine and drink menu.  \n\nThe service was outstanding.  They brought me a special desert free of charge.  It was standard for b-days but still very nice.  \n\nIt is a bit pricey, however, so be prepared.  $193 for app, two entrees, a bottle of wine one cocktail, tax and tip (although I tip fairly well).  \n\nOverall, very nice experience at Olives!",3
"I think this might be what a drug-induced sex-less orgy might be like.\n\nLe R\u00eave offers a visually spectacular experience that seems almost unreal at times.  From what I understand, the acts for the show change from time to time.  The friends I went with remarked that the show, and even the stage (if one can even dumb the extravagant setting down to a single word), had metamorphosed since their last visit.\n\nAll I know is that I don't remember ever witnessing this level of athleticism and choreography in a show in... ever.  I liken it to some old-school Cirque shows I've seen in the past... on crack.  With disjointed acts, tied tenuously together by the theme of a dream, there are very few points where there isn't a smorgasbord of activity to feast your eyes on.  And the entire intimate space is used -- from the depths of the water to the dizzying heights of an out-of-sight ceiling, and from wall to wall.  There's doesn't seem to be a single cube of space that isn't involved in the show in some way.\n\nAnd that doesn't even touch upon the modular, insane, hydraulic contraption that serves a variety of purposes.  Attempting to describe the platform stage seems pretty futile.  You have to see it to believe it.\n\nThe same goes for the bodies of the performers.  I think if you summed the body fat percentage of the entire cast, the total would -still- be less than mine.  I can neither confirm nor deny that there may or may not have been just the littlest tiniest wee bit of eye-raping going on.\n\nPlus, shockingly, the tickets for Le R\u00eave were more affordable than those for K\u00e0.  It doesn't hurt that we happened to be staying at The Wynn, either.  Nothing like a little boozy boozy before-show action in the casino, followed by a heavy dose of delicious eye-candy.",4
"This place is great for enjoying the nice weather, either for a quiet night out with friends or for a delicious brunch on the weekends. So far everything I've tried from the kitchen has been yummy, and the staff is going out of their way to make things right if something comes out a little off (friends' dish was a bit cool, but they remade it again from scratch and it came out piping hot). Parking can be a little challenging if it's busy (thanks city of Phoenix for mining your own people for money with your stupid parking meters), but it's still well worth it to come by for a visit!",4
"Eeew no! Very disappointing. We came here for brunch since it's really cheap compared to their dinners (very expensive!), and it wasn't good. The fried dough was very good, but my Farmer's Wife frittata sucked! It had no flavor except for sour asparagus. Our server was brusque and inattentive. She kept bitching about us not makin a reservation even though we called ahead and were told it was ok to come over. it wasn't busy either. She then ignored us when it came time to settle up and didn't total up our check, which meant we had to use our calculators on our phones. Nice decor though, but you can't eat that. lol. The clientele is mainly rich, old, stuffy people too even though it's in Beechview which is not Mt. Lebo. No thanks.",1
"Leticia's USE to be a great place for Mexican food, unfortunately no longer. The service is very slow and sporadic at best. The food lately has been just ok, and the quality has definitely gone down hill. We enjoy eating at local places, non chains and are very disappointed in the direction this restaurant is going.",1
Tacos and Tequila! Try her new Honey Margarita it is pretty good. \n\nOf course there was a Groupon Now! offer that I wanted to use. Friends have spoken of this place and said it was as fun as Fuego Bistro (behind Kobalt for all my Folk out there). I Love the tostadas from Bistro. \n\nAt Fuego Taco the blonde chick behind the bar and the nice sexy looking girl seemed to be the only two working the whole entire restaurant by themselves. At first I was a bitt nervous. Of course I thought service would be terrible because of the limited staff but was I wrong. Our waters were first with a nice little flip of the hair and on to drink recommendations. She mentioned her new margarita and I was tempted to try. Not within 3min she had it at the table. And this drink is very very tasty. \n\nWe decided on the Carne Asada/Short Rib Barbacoa and would share the two. Both were great but I would pass on the rice next time. \n\nI could not thank the two that were working that night. You two were EXCELLENT!!!,4
"If you want to see a comedy magic show on a budget while in Las Vegas, this is a great show to see. The quality is phenomenal for the price. $30 got the wife and I in the very front row at The Flamingo Theater where several folks right around us got pulled into the act. \n\nThe quality of the illusions was great and what really added even more value to the show was the two guests Nathan brought in from other shows. Not only did it break up the routine of trick after trick, it added some tremendous comical moments to the show, one of which had most everybody about peeing their pants with laughter.\n\nIt was so good, I'll probably see it again on our next trip to Vegas, even if it is the same. Nathan Burton Comedy Magic Show - highly recommended.",4
"We had an extremely mediocre lunch here.  There is nothing that was so memorable about our meal that would ever make me come back.  The setting is nice, in the middle of the Venetian rotunda.  The service was ok, the food itself was so-so.  Mixed results at the table.  I had a risotto which was just ok, a co-worker of mine had a seafood dish which he enjoyed, another had the osso bucco and thought it was terrible. Another co-worker had a very dull looking margherita pizza.  My wife had a very ordinary salad with a very ordinary minestrone. With so many other options in the immediate area, this is one you can skip with no hesitation.  For extremely mediocre Italian food, this is your choice.",1
"I bought a LivingSocial for Shawna's massage services and it was a decent enough massage. After some confusion on when I was supposed to come in, I made the appointment for a couple weeks out. Her salon is in a weird office building on Lake Mead in Henderson and is pretty much the only thing like it in the building. \n\nThe LivingSocial included aromatherapy, and she had about six choices to choose from. The room temperature was fine, the pressure was fine, everything was a-okay.\n\nI probably won't be back because I am a whore for cheap massages....LivingSocial and Groupon know how to get me. I can't justify going back somewhere and paying more when I know there's someone just as good who is offering a cheap-ass-cheap massage for a limited time. I would, however, recommend Shawna as her office is located nicely where no other massage is located and she did provide a good massage on a dime.",3
"Well my Mr turned 40 today and what better way to show my love then to take him out for a nice dinner for 2. Well as you can see by my rating this went horribly wrong very fast.\n\n***** The space at Fines is modern comfort. Comfortable with long oversized banquets.. ball chain screen and cool stained concrete floors that looked like suede. We were sat off a 7pm reservation immediately. We both noticed that the patio was hopping.. great for a new local business. We ordered a couple of glasses of wine from the host and loved the selection from that menu as well as the food menu.\n\n**** We waited for some time until our glasses of wine were brought to our table. The person delivering was apparently our server. She never asked how we were.. told us her name.. just dropped the wine off and asked if we were ready to order. We placed our order and took in each other. The wine was very good and the space comfortable. Our apps came out in pretty decent time and we dug in. I had the calamari and the Mr had the BLT.. both were pretty good though mine should have had less salt. Otherwise the food paired with our wines quite well.\n\n***Waiting for our plates to be cleared we felt that maybe we weren't that important. The host guy was fawning over 2 tables with champagne service as well as sports scores for the table next to us. Service is a pretty big deal to me and can pretty much ruin an evening. Finally our plates were cleared and salads brought out some time after that. I had the Arancini and the Mr had the grilled radicchio salad. Both were prepared well and pretty tasty. We also ordered 2 more glasses of wine which came out pretty quickly. Then we were done and we waited once again.. and waited.. and waited.\n\n**Meanwhile the server assistant came and took our plates. I also asked where my new glass of wine was I had ordered at the beginning of the salad course. The assistant went to the bar and grabbed my glass of wine and was intercepted by our server who then snatched it from her hands. She then tossed her hair and brought me the glass. Now we had no silverware.. no water and a glass of wine. Then we waited and waited again.\n\n*Finally after 35 minutes our server told us the kitchen was backed up and that the entrees would be out in 5 minutes. We told her fine if it was only 5 minutes. We waiting this long, whats another 5 minutes? 5 minutes passed, then another 5, finally I called her over and asked for the check. She said the entrees were coming up soon I told her just the check please. She asked if we wanted them boxed. I told her sure. She brought the check out, 150 bucks.. I paid and left her only 10% which was VERY generous.. she brought the boxed entrees which we left on the table and stormed out.\n\nAs you can see the Mr birthday dinner was squashed.. I got mad and paid to much for food we didn't eat. So much for an awesome dinner for his birthday. Now I feel embarrassed, let down and of course sad that I didn't show my man a good time on his once 40th birthday.\n\nWhat a real shame to what could have been a great place muddled by horrendous service. \""The valley's premiere wine/dine destination\"".. yeah keep trying to believe that!",0
"We chose this restaurant because of the proximity of our hotel. The food was ok, but the overall experience was a disaster. The table was setup,but dirty. And worst of all the staff were amazingly arrogant. We have an 11 year old picky eater, she wanted to see the kids menu; the manager asked her age and refused to give her a kids menu since it's for 10 years old only. Wow really accommodating.

"An update: My initial review still holds for this gym - although I would say that that folks at the desk are very, very nice. Three things I wanted to add:\n- Microphones: The microphones in the classes seem like they are constantly broken.\n- Classes: The classes are the main reason I still go to this gym, but they are making it more and more difficult. My favorite class was just replaced in a couple instances by bodypump, which is ok, but not as good as 24SET. Also, it is packed and you have to pre-register. Because I can't get to the gym an hour early , this is another class I have to pay a dollar to pre-register for if I want to attend. Doesn't seem like a big deal, but my membership is actually about $10 additional every month because of the classes I have to pre-register for to get a spot. They need to add more classes. \n- They just added card-less check-in, which is an awesome convenience.",2
"This is one of the largest gold's that I have been to. I cant account for how much membership fees are since my membership is grandfathered from like 5 years ago. I have also just found out that this golds is not a corporate location which sucks for someone like that that travels alot. So because of that, i have to sign in everytime i come here and am limited to how often i can come here. However, I have been to many different golds in different cities so i can compare quality of the gym itself. I am the type to do hardcore cardio, free weights, as well as take advantage of the classes they offer. The treadmills are fairly new and most of them have individual tv screens attached to it as well as ipod/USB/3.5mm ports to connect to them. The free weight room have an abundance of weights, though I do wish they have more benchs (I think they only have 5 or 6). The thing I wasnt used to is they use towels for cleaning the machines as to other golds usually use paper towels. i guess this is more environmentally friendly and I just need to get use to it. i havent attended a class yet but when i do, i will update!",2
This is my favorite donut shop ever! They are fresh made every day and have a large selection. Haven't found anything better than these. \nWill be back....many times. :),4
"Coming from out of town, but have Buca's in my home town, and I have to say, NOT IMPRESSED. \n- Iffy service\n- Portions over the top\n- Drinks never refilled\n- Servers not knowledgeable AT ALL about their menu.\n\nBut this confirms that ALL the Buca di Beppo's suck.",0
"I went to the show last Thursday night and it was fun! We went on a Thursday night and figured maybe not as much bachelorettes, yeah right. The dancing was hilarious, but we aren't judging a dance show. The guys were hot and the host was hilarious! A very fun time, but way too many bachelorettes!! Their parties were super annoying, but decently priced drinks. Also the seat prices weren't badly priced either. The show is only about an hour and 10 minutes maybe, good timing to go to a club afterward. I just wish there was dancing and more interaction with the audience. \n\nFYI, Excalibur is super under construction! We had to keep walking around because of the construction after the show.",2
Good food and service. Would definitely go back.,3
"J'etais client depuis l'ouverture et recommander des dizaines de clients mais derni\u00e8rement la qualit\u00e9 de la nourriture laisse \u00e0 d\u00e9sirer.

"Restaurant website:  http://www.wolfgangpuck.com/restaurants/fine-dining/9044\n20th Anniversary article:   http://bit.ly/12aYGup\n\nI only ate here Tue/11 Dec at 5:30 pm since 11-14 Dec 2012 Spago was having a 20th anniversary celebration with a Retro 1992 menu/prices.\n- Off the Retro Menu: Had the $9 stir fried lamb lettuce cups appetizer and the $17 oven roasted salmon entree; both were excellent.  Portions were on the small size but with the free bread (5 types to choose from), I was full by the end of the meal.\n- To save money I planned on not getting a drink (just their free \""ice water\"") then I noticed a Bud Light was $6 but the house-made Sangria was $7, so I ordered a tasty Sangria.\n- My server (Charlotte?) was attentive and so were the free bread server & ice water refiller.\n- That night (11 Dec) Wolfgang Puck was there to receive praise/speeches from Caesars(?) executives & receive a key to the city/slot machines (I think that was the joke the mayor was making) from Mayor Carolyn Goodman.  He also took photos with interested patrons/diners.  Seems like a great, affable guy.\n- I would love to come back to Spago but alas I can't swing the normal menu prices.",4
Complete B.S. that the social media team private messaged me to try and resolve this issue. Offering a buffet meal is not resolving the issue. Leslie and her social media team did NOTHING! Their sports book employee is a RACIST and refused to help me place my wager. Horrible customer service. I will never set foot in the M resort again. Stay away and go to a property where they will treat you right.,0
All you can eat $25. How could you go wrong? The sushi is very good. And the hot food as well.,3
"This place is good but not amazing, at least not by the new 5 star standard set by Les 3 Petit Bouchons. It's also incredibly loud. We were seated at a small table by the front window and had to really raise our voices just to talk at the table - I can't imagine having been seated in the middle of the restaurant.\n\nWe shared a few starters and one main. The empanada, a seasonal special, was definitely the standout item. We also had the salmon tartare (which, to our surprise, was actually *smoked*), the trous Normand and another off-menu item, the veal in chorizo sauce. All was satisfactory, but with the slight exception of the empanada, the refined flavour combinations and certain extra special quality that sets the extraordinary apart from the simply good or above average was not there. \n\nNo issues with the service, whatsoever.",3
"I don't even think this walmart deserves a star....worst walmart ever. Completely disorganized, no one knows where anything is and even though there's tons of employees walking around pretending to do stuff there's no one there to check u out. 22 check stands and 4 at max are open! It took me longer to check out than it did to shop. Absolutley despise this place!",0
"Many grocery stores to choice from in the Arcadia / Biltmore area, none compare to this Safeway though.  AJ's is pricier, Albertson's is laid out oddly and not as nice, Trader Joe's doesn't always have the savings or selection and Fry's is over-the-top ( Winebar? In a grocery store?)\n\nCourteous staff, great selection, good savings and convenient location assist me in my monthly grocery habit.  Just stocked up again this evening for under $100.  Mangoes were priced at 2/$!",3
"Sorry, but this place is only average. The staff is very friendly, but the food was bland, and nothing special. Decent ingredients but not made with love, just thrown together. If you're selling yourself as a New York deli, you'd better pull it off. They didn't.",1
"A great special occasion restaurant.\n\nA group of six went here to celebrate my sons birthday.\nI made reservations a week in advance.\nWhen we got there at 7p right on time, they told us a 20 minute wait, huh?\nAfter 20 minutes our buzzer thing went off and they said, 'your table of 8 is ready', huh? I said six, right?\n\nAfter another 10 minute wait we finally got seated. Of course, no one apologized or made any effort for a concession.  \n\nI'm not going to go over board like so many others have on their review.\nThe  concept they have is nothing new. It's the same thing as the 'dim sum' concept except for meat eaters.\n\nI liked that they remembered my son's birthday, had a cake and sang happy birthday in Portuguese.\n\nI also, like the complimentary valet parking.\n\nWe were looking for MJ who lives on the top floor but no sighting this time.\nOh yeah, the check for six was $305.00, we had a few crown and sodas.\nThe usual price per person with tax is $44.00; that includes the salad bar. Pay attention to your check as they add an 18% gratuity.\n\nI would def recommend you go with the top sirloin, it's a choice cut and has the best flavor.  \n\nIt's cool that they all have iPhones and your head waiter can make a text request for the type of meat you want and they are at your table pronto!",3
"I don't see what the hype is about this place.  My lovely British boyfriend wanted to go to Nando's for a quick lunch before we did some sightseeing and told me I would love it.  I mean, I like chicken and all, but I was extremely underwhelmed by my experience there.  It's just a chicken wrap with a choice of a few sauces.  The hottest hot sauce is WEAAAAAKKKK.  Seriously, I want to cry while I'm eating my spicy chicken wraps.  Also, I got the mashed peas as a side and it was the strangest thing on the planet - I do not recommend trying them.  I mean, I would eat here again, but wouldn't rate it high on my list of places to go to!\n\nAs a footnote, I also do not see the hype about Chick-Fil-A and Church's Chicken in America (down in the South) and everyone raves about both spots.",1
Quaint place close to downtown. After touring the heard museum we headed over here in search of authentic mexican food. The food was indeed delicious! They also had a selection of home made cookies and rolls and things like that in the 'bakery' section. My friend was absolutely in love with their salsa which you can buy in an 8 oz. portion for I believe 3 or 4.99 or something like that. I was a little concerned when the person ordering in front of us had their order taken completely in spanish. I have zero language skills other than english but was pleasantly surprised when it came our turn and the girl took our order in 100% fluent enlish. Would go here again if I was ever in the area.,3
Songbird is such a cute little coffee spot\nThe interior is fun and I love the scrabble tiled menu\nIve only had the hot chocolate here\nas it is deemed my hot cocoa spot during\nFirst Fridays\n\nI could imagine sitting there with a book or laptop\nwith not a care in the world,3
"I'm a rocker by nature but have an affinity for country music and the honky tonk scene.  Checked this place out with a couple friends just out of curiosity.  The place is huge!  Interesting mix of people, not just country lovers which was cool.  They really pack in the people though which after getting bumped into several times can get annoying depending on who's doing the bumping if you know what i mean.  Next time I wouldn't mind renting a cabana just to have a little personal space to retreat to if needed.  I had a decent burger with fries.  Food was middle of the road.  Nothing special.  Had more fun people watching then anything.",2
Excellent place to pick up your books for a low price. Much better then the UNLV Bookstore.,4
"I miss Fusion Burritos, dang construction. I love the ideas they have an d the concept. Keep up the awesome work and brainstorming, change is good.",4
"I didn't have reservations, so I scoured the Palazzo's site for a dinner house, and stumbled on CarneVino. It's Mario Batali's place, aside from B & B, so I figured hurray! Maybe it will be like Pizzeria Mozza. NOPE. It was more like Osteria Mozza, but meatier, and sticker shock. Now, we're staying at the Palazzo and had Joel Robuchon reservations, so prize isn't an issue. When you're expecting it. I'll pay $10 for ice cream when I know it's $10 ice cream. \n\nMr. V was also not in a terrific mood - mostly due to not being able to hear the waiter well with his heavy accent and low voice, so when he didn't understand the way that the per person for two prices were laid out, his cage was rattled - so the meal wasn't as pleasant as I had wished. \n\nI ordered a house glass of white wine because CarneVino is a place where bottles are ordered, and Mr. V doesn't drink wine. I ordered the prosciutto with melon slices, which was absolutely wonderful. The prosciutto was so delicately sliced and just the right amount of salty. The melon slices were soft and juicy, not overly sweet/ripe, and made a nice after bite when I was done with the prosciutto. I didn't role them much, just enjoyed the pink slices with my fingers and glass of wine.\n\nNow, having been to Batali's two Mozzas in LA, I've had his egg ravioli, his ragus, his octopus, his cheeses, and I'm not going to eat a porterhouse steak by myself. All their steak offerings were just too large for me. So I went with his seafood stew, which was very similar to cioppino. If anything, that's what it was without being called that. It was spicier than I'd anticipated, so it actually upset my stomach. That's not the stew's fault, but my own for not eating much throughout the day that wasn't done through a straw. The head-on shrimp (two in two days!) was the best part of it though. No matter the upsetness of my belly, I was not letting that guy leave my table uneaten. It was good overall, but would've liked less spicy. Or been told it would be spicy. \n\nMr. V ordered the 20oz pork loin, bone-in. Now, pork is strange in the way that you want it fully cooked, but not...well done, so to speak. So there's a delicate balance between juicy and tough with the white meats. Mr. V immediately said \""chef's preference\"", but the waiter hung back and said that maybe it was a little pink. Pink on pork is not really that appetizing, so Mr. V said medium, and the waiter bowed his head and left. Well, bad idea. Because the pork was tough - and this was AFTER Mr. V had given his okay to however it should be cooked! I was actually astonished, and almost wanted to send it back FOR him. But the charred edges with caramelized butter were so, so good. He ate the entire thing, so it wasn't so bad. But definitely not what I would've expected, especially AFTER the waiter had advised against Mr. V's wishes. \n\nThe restaurant was okay - and as usual, I'd like to give places more than one chance because every place/couple have a bad night. Mr. V was not happy though, and I can definitely understand why.",2
Awesome night club.  Will most likely Cindee back again next Vegas trip. Bar service was quick good music.  Glad they had two floors for hip-hop and Edm. Tiesto was playing when I went so tickets were 100$. Only thing that threw me off was someone taking a piss in the corner of the club.,3
"This location is at Chauncey Ranch, just south of the 101, in the new Whole Foods plaza. It has not only the Destination Maternity, it has a higher end Mimi Maternity and luxury brand Pea in the Pod at the same location, along with an Edamame Spa.\n\nWith that out of the way -- I REALLY wanted to like this place. I went to the old location at Desert Ridge and was pleased with the low cost, big selection and service. The atmosphere was laid back and casual.\n\nUnfortunately, at this location, you will be immediately attacked by salespeople at every turn. In my first visit, I was stopped at least seven or eight times by people asking if I wanted help or wanted to visit the spa. Since it was close to the grand opening, I let it go at overzealousness. However, a few months later I got the same experience. I appreciate the helpfulness, and I understand what it's like to work on commission, but they stick to you like white on rice and make the experience really annoying. I've started either shopping at their online store, visiting other locations or going to different stores. Other than that, the prices are pretty OK as long as you stick to the clearance section at Destination -- the other two places are ridiculously priced considering how long you WON'T be wearing the clothes.",1
"The food is definitely good. Lots of options for vegetarian. The eggplant meal was great and the portions are good, although the prices seem a bit high.\n\nThey are cash and check only and I didn't see a sign outside and no one said anything when we walked in. There's a fee free ATM across the street but it would have been nice to know going in.\n\nThe service was only okay though. The waiter wasn't very attentive, got the order wrong, appeared to have some attitude when he collected our menus and brought us our check before we even said we were finished (one of my pet peeves in restaurants - hence 3 and not 4 stars) and therefore had to hand write in the desserts.",2
"I had a few problems with my experience here. I came for boba and they only have like 5 flavors. I ordered Kimchi Bibimbap and a mango smoothie with boba to dine in. The cashier said \""You can't have that now, maybe for dessert.\"" Um, what? That is not how I ordered. I got the bibimbap and it wasn't anything special. Nothing to write home about. I thought their kimchi was pretty bland and I LOOOOOVE kimchi, I try A LOT of kimchi. So for the kimchi in your kimchi bibimbap to be lackluster seems pretty sad. I got my food and about 5-10 minutes after I got my smoothie. It was very artificial tasting and had absolutely no boba. I have been trying to find a good place to get boba near campus and this place will not be it.",2
Definitely underestimated this place!! While it might lack the fabulosity of the Aeria or Cosmo it certainly makes up for in charm and overall cleanliness of the place. I'll have to admit I was expecting this place to be a little run down but was pleasantly surprised by our rooms being more in the updated side of things. They have a none smoking section which was simply amazing because I cannot stand cigarette smoke. We definitely had a good night sleep since the beds were super comfy! It was like melting into a marshmallow. \n\nMy only dislike for this hotel was the Kahuna restaurant downstairs! Other than that this was definitely a great place to stay.,3
I have been going to this salon for 3 or 4 years. Not only is it super convenient for me because it is down the street from my house the service here is impeccable. Cathy Messer is a great hair dresse! She gives the best hair cuts and is a perfectionist.  Nicole Artino does my nails and does an amazing job and is great to talk to. I receive compliments on my hair and nails often. Everyone here takes pride in what they do and the atmosphere is extremely inviting.,4
"Waffled back and forth between one and two stars.  Felt maybe they only deserved two because they didn't actually break anything on my car, but went with one anyway because I felt they would have.\n\nThese aren't mechanics; they're minimum wage guys who've been trained to do a repetitive task over and over.  I took my car in for an alignment, and when I tried telling the service rep what was going on with my car, he stared at me blankly like he had no idea what I was talking about, then handed me a pre-printed questionnaire to fill out inquiring about the symptoms as to why I felt I needed an alignment.  Okaaaay....   Then, when the guy was trying to input the info into the computer, despite my telling him literally no fewer than five times the make, model, and year of my car... he was searching under the wrong car brand!  Not off to a good start, especially since he kept trying to upswell me on things I didn't want.\n\nWell, not-good start got worse when I got a call 30 minutes after dropping it off, saying they couldn't do an alignment on my car, because it was too new and they didn't have the proper specs for it.  Mind you, I was in need of an alignment because I'd changed parts on my car from factory stock, so stock specs wouldn't have done them any good anyhow.  They should have known this when I asked them if they could do alignment work to begin with.\n\nIf you're the sort of person who has no problem getting their oil changed at Walmart or Jiffy Lube, because you prize cheapness over quality, attentive mechanics, then maybe you'll do alright here.  If you're someone who wants to take your car to a shop with trained, knowledgeable mechanics who understand how to maintain a car properly, or are a person who values your time, avoid this place at all costs.",0
Want good Mexican food? Go here.,4
"I hadn't been to las Vegas in 30 years so was not quite sure what to expect. The Encore is a great \""all in one\"" resort. Almost no need to go anywhere else. The design is amazing: Vegas but not tacky; the rooms, service, pools, restaurants, shopping, the show \""Reve\""- all great. The Spas is especially luxurious and a great resource. Unless you are going to another show, no need to leave the place!",4
"I got the KF coconut milk tea with boba and it was so delicious! The price was great and the environment was super friendly. I am so happy we decided to give this place a try, and I can't wait till we are in Vegas again. Definitely will be coming back and trying other drinks!",4
"Me and the hubby tried this out today, we had the appetizer sampler with baba gnoush, falafel and labaneh. First off the falafel was delicious and piping hot, the labaneh wast tangy thick and cool the baba gnoush had an odd aftertaste neither of us cared for. The pitas did come in little ziplocs which was not an issue but the strong refrigerator taste on them was it distracted from the flavors of the dips. After ordering our Gyros I asked if it came with anything I was told no but I could add fries which I was going to do but the waiter told me the gyro was very large so I decided against it. Now let me qualify my review of the gyro by saying I have eaten and loved gyros since I could walk, I have been looking for a good gyro shop here for a while and have had to settle for just ok....that being said this gyro was not very good. it was really low on toppings, based on what the waiter said it felt almost like the cook only made one gyro then instead of making another just split the meat and veggies between the two. The meat was not 100% meat there were obviously a lot of fillers. It left a lot to be desired I may go back but more than likely I wont.",2
"Did you know that when the conveyor belt is moving, you get fresh and free DONUT SAMPLES?! I did not! I came here with a couple of friends after dinner at Monta Chaya and drinks at No. 1 Boba (yea we are big pigs). The conveyor belt was doing its magic and lo and behold the guy behind the counter asks me if I want a free donut. Uh YESSSS who doesn't?! Another step closer to diabetes, but it just tastes oh so good. Melt in your mouth hot and fresh donut sugar heaven is just too much. I can't even write about this anymore.",4
"I have used PreFlight for over ten years I think (wow! time flies!!).  It is extremely convenient and easy, along with competitive pricing.\n\nI have never had to wait more than a few moments for a van to pick me up - both from the parking lot to get me to the airport, and from the curbside pick up to take me back to my car.  Much less schlepping of luggage than parking on-site at the airport as they pick you up and drop you off at your car!\n\nThere are probably some tricks as to the more convenient locations to park within the lot, I have my favorites that get me in an out quickest (not sure if I want to share these!!).\n\nI have even used their car wash services in the past and returned home to a clean car ready for me to head home in!  They have a frequent parkers program, online reservations for those busy times at the airport - and best yet, free (yes, free) cold water bottles at the vending machines as you are leaving the parking area (this is a fantastic perk during the summer months, returning home dehydrated from flying and getting into a hot car!).\n\nDefinitely a recommend.",4
I used to come here a lot. The food was great and the service was always nice. Recently however they started charging you for water ... This is the most ridiculous thing I have ever heard. They make enough money from the public from their expensive food that it is crazy to me that they would charge for water..!!! Needless to say I will not be going back.,0
"So good! AMAZING food and the waitress was very attentive. The rest of the staff was super friendly. Really, the food was just amazing. The portions were huge...enough for more than 2 meals. It's always packed when we drive by, but we got there at 4pm and were seated immediately.",4
"It's Walmart. What kind of review can we write over and over? I'll buy almost anything here. I think the one thing I won't buy fruit and veggies. Don't know why? I'll buy meat here, milk, eggs, oh not chicken. I think that's because I see those items sit out after returns and never go back fast enough. Or I am just too picky and buy those items at Safeway or Fry's.",2
"FOOD POISONING FROM OYSTERS \nI dined there on Tuesday September 4th with my boyfriend. We had oysters and a Sancerre. I had been skeptical of eating oysters in the desert but I called Bouchon and the hostess asked the kitchen and reassured me that they're flown in fresh every day. \n\nAlas, I got food poisoning and couldn't eat for the rest of the week. Look up \""DSP.\"" Yep, that's what the ER told me I got. In fact it's Sunday now and I'm just barely turning the corner. Dining here dampered my Vegas vacation to say the least.",0

"It's been a while but it's still good.\n\n\nIf you like  ice cream (and who doesnt) and you are not afraid of the calories. Then Cold Stone Creamy is the place for you. Coldstone has good  Ice cream and you get to create\n your own custom ice-cream creation. \n\nAs we entered the store we were greeted with a loud \""Hello\"".  There was a bit of a long line however, the folks at Coldstone  kept the line moving.  As we waited in line, it was obvious that the staff at Cold Stone enjoyed working there and working with each other. \n\nWhen it was our turn we were served and given suggestions by the staff.  Its been a while since I last visited coldstone but it was still as good as i remembered.\n\nColdstone has awesome service, lots of choices of icecream, so if your in the area give it a try",2
"I stayed at the MGM back in September with a few of my girlfriends. After a full morning out by the pool, slightly tipsy from a few drinks, we were ready for lunch.... a cheap-ish lunch by Las Vegas standards. So a friend and I gathered the $$ and went on the hunt for some food.\n\nThis place caught our eye, as did the wonderful smell coming from inside. The line was pretty quick, there are a tone of different and unique sandwich choices, and wow it was one of the best sandwiches I've had. Needless to say we ate lunch here the next two days.\n\nMy personal fave. is the Panini with chicken breast, roasted red pepper, mozzarella and pesto on country bread....yummy!",3
"I like small businesses like this. There prices are reasonable and the staff is very courteous. The food is also decent. I have to admit, the location kinda sucks because it is hidden by buildings. My wife doesnt like pad thai but she actually enjoyed theirs. So that should say alot about this restaurant.",2
"Maybe I just ordered the wrong things or they were having an off day. I ordered the make your own with corn beef, swiss and mustard on ciabatta. I had a 2 for 1 flyer so I got a sandwich for the hubby  to go and mine to stay. I also got a large drink because they used to have great fresh brewed tea. I was so disappointed when I went to the beverage bar and it was gone and has been replaced with a multi tea dispenser thats cartridge based. I took a seat and waited a while as it seemed they only had one cook even though it was prime lunch time on a Friday. \n\nThe girl who brought me my sandwich didn't say a word even when I said thank you. My sandwich, the bread was awesome I have to say, but it was like 2 slices of corn beef and a thin sliver of swiss.  Their ad says our sandwiches are \""180 degrees from lunch meat on bread\"" so what I got I wasn't really expecting. It was OK, but the beef was cold which I wasn't expecting or I would have had veggies added to it.\n\nOverall it was just OK, I don't think I'll be rushing back...what is ironic is they had a sign that said \""they love us on Yelp\""..I guess I am just the oddball..",1
"Me, my former roommates, my wife and some other friends all love this place. You can eat great flavor like a horse. The only downside is that it is closed part of the day to regroup in between lunch and dinner so if you are craving it in between those times then you have to wait till they re open. Usually like an hour or so. The people are awesome though and it is well worth the wait.",3
"I am a big fan of Edible Arrangements! They are just as pretty as flowers, but you get to eat them too. I've ordered a few bouquets in the past, both chocolate covered & plain fruit (see photos). Last week was national dipped fruit week & all stores were selling boxes normally priced $25 for $10, so I got 2. I would prefer just strawberries & green apples, but got a variety of fruits in my boxes (see photo). Delivery can be a bit pricey, I'm glad they are so close to my house, that way I can just pick them up myself. With my last order I got a couple $5 off coupons, I think I'll order my mom a bouquet for her birthday next month!",3
"I have rated this place before and I'm back to up them to 5 stars. My husband and I revisited tonight and we ordered the j-tom roll, crunch roll, and rock n roll. All three rolls were delicious this time unlike our last visit. We were extremely happy with our selection of rolls and I can say that I'm still in love with the rock n roll !\n31Jan2012\nThey've been slacking the last few times I've been in here. Hopefully they pick it back up.",3
"This was my first time at either the Red Owl OR Club Red, and I will say I was not impressed with either.  I pulled up and the cops were swarming Club Red, no idea why - but that was a nice welcome.  My good friend and co-worker was playing at the Red Owl, hence the visit.  It was an \""all ages\"" event, so drinks were only allowed on the worst half of the venue - which was the 2nd \""nice\"" welcome.\n\nWhile my friend did a great job, the \""security\"" seemed more than necessary - and overly aggressive based on the group on THAT side of the joint.  Long story short, the service wasn't great, the venue was outdated and somewhat contrived - and if not for the cute, curly haired bartender, this would be one star only.\n\nDon't bother!",1
I came here because Imperial Spa was closed for renovations. My sister and I were in town to celebrate her birthday and after a long night of partying we wanted our massage/scrub. This place looks totally sketch from the outside. It's in a desolate strip mall/office strip complex directly across the Gold Coast and you feel like you're gonna get an STD if you look at the place for more than 2 seconds. The windows are painted over with a faded Niagara Falls-esq scenic handpainting...the kind you see at really bad seafood restaurants and we ALMOST didn't go in. Turns out it's not so bad! It's clean and has the essentials of any korean spa. There are no jade rooms or anything fancy like that but totally did the trick. The little lady here gave me a better massage and scrub down than the ladies at the Imperial Spa. She hopped up on the table and even walked on my bad and feet! Weird but totally cool. Definitely worth checking out.,2
"This is a nice hotel, not the best, but it's nice. It was great for the price, especially the free breakfast. However, the reason for the five stars is not for the actual hotel, which was clean, comfortable, but not super special. The rating for this hotel is for the staff. They were friendly, sweet, helpful and took far of problems quickly. There were a couple of issues that came up that were no fault of the staff, but they took care of the problems quickly and with great customer service. An added plus is that the diner that shares a parking lot with the hotel is awesome.",4
"Just like the other reviewers have mentioned, while the food is pretty good, the service and flexibility is non-existent.\n\nI ordered the shrimp and scallop garlic sauce. I don't really like rice and prefer Lo Mein noodles. When I asked for a substitution, I thought the server had seen a ghost. She quickly said. No...they can't do that. I asked not even with an upcharge? No. can't do it.\n\nWow. I was stunned. I probably should have just left but I took the dish as is. Their motto should be \""You get what you get but you don't pitch a fit.\"" Really? A minor substitution like that? The place was fairly empty and it reminded me that again, I need to read Yelp before I go.\n\nTwo stars for the food quality.",1
"My drinks are always made correctly here, and the place looks great, post recent remodel, but I echo the sentiment of other reviews: this is one of the slowest drive thrus I have ever experienced. I don't know if it is because the breakfast item options slowed the process, or if there is no sense of urgency, or what. Usually the customer service is friendly and seems sincere.",2
The drive thru people act like they are on the Beavis and Butthead show.,0
"One of the best shows I've even seen in my life.\n\nLa Reve is at the Wynn.  It means \""the dream\"" and I thought the show stays true to the title.  It was abstract and open to interpretation, personally left me breathless and inspired when I left the show.  The dancers were beyond amazing, their musicality was top notch and the choreographies were one of a kind.\n\nThe stage was so cool, it can be \""closed\"" to make grounds for the performers to dance on, or \""open\"" for them to do water choreographies and diving stunts.  The costumes were so well thought-out, it highlighted the performer's strength as well as their elegance.  I was mesmerized and captivated throughout the whole show.\n\nKinda pricey but well worth it.  I would highly recommend this show to anyone anyday.",4
"Really nothing special to this place except the outside seating they have in the summer.  Recently came here, and my friend ordered a Coors Light draught (wimp i know), but it tasted absolutely awful.  Don't know if it was the keg that was bad or the hoses that hook up to the keg that need to be cleaned. \n\nNext I got a Turkey Rachel.  Probably one of the most flavorless sandwiches I've ever had.  The only thing I could really taste, was the rye bread it was on, which was quite good.  My friend got the veggie powerhouse salad.  He did seem to enjoy that.  I had a bite as well, and I will say, not bad.\n\nOverall, service was super slow.  I don't think I'll be back for a meal anytime soon.  It's just too mediocre to waste your time, money, or calories here.",1
"Being a good husband, I volunteered to take my wife to another day at Sister's Closet. It takes her hours to go through everything - and I'm usually left to find something to do to kill time.  Fortunately, they now have an Einstein's in the same shopping area.  A lifesaver!! I was able to have several cups of coffee, some wonderful onion bagels with cream cheese, and to casually read the newspaper without being hurried and feeling I was taking up space.\n\nIt is large, clean, and the workers a cheerful and helpful.  The only glitch was that on one of my bagel orders, they lost the order!! Not a big deal - I wasn't going anywhere  - so once they figured out the order got lost in cyberspace - they immediately re-entered it and brought it to my table.\n\nSo now I'm covered - if my wife has to be at Sisters early in the morning, I can relax at Einsteins!!",3
I have only been once. Nice staff. Quality ingredients. Tasty and fresh cold cut subs. I had the Italian. Yum!,3
"blah boring boy clothes everything is really plan if you like gray sweat pants then this place is perfect, the only cute boy stuff is the jammies other then that not real cute stuff for boys. idk about girls stuff because I have boys.",0
"Husband and I went for dinner, it was not busy and were seated right away. Sat there for 30 minutes and no one ever came to even get our drink order, we walked out!! Very limited menu. Would not recommend.",0
"I like going to Walgreen over cvs any day. They have more than one register open and you don't have to wait in line for an hour, as opposed to the hour you spend in line at cvs. The pharmacy staff is pleasant to deal with too.",3
"Went last night with the girlfriend and shared some beef pho and a noodle dish with various meats. The former was pretty good, thanks to some very tasty beef broth; the latter was decent but nothing special. Portions were generous for the price and service was fine. I'd be happy to return to this welcome addition to Murray Avenue.",2
The Arizona burger was and is the best burger I have ever had. The executive chef hand delivers the food to your table which is awesome. If the chef doesn't bring your food then be sure that the sous chef has prepared your meal. My wife and I could taste the difference between the two chefs so be sure to ask if the exec chef is cooking that night before going in. Excellent selection of draft beer! For sure the best selection in town. Friendly staff!,4
You know how I feel about dirty bathrooms - this place gets 2 stars - nothing at this location was basically any better and yet the bathrooms were filthy. You can't mess up ice cream - so enough said. Don't go out of your way for ice cream if this is where you think you want to go.,1
Good pho with fast service! The spring rolls are amazing! Place is really clean,3
"Happy hour is great for drinks, but could stand to be expanded a bit on the food side.  With that said, the food itself is delicious and very reasonably priced even outside of happy hour. I'd recommend the spicy tuna salad - delicious and a great value for how much you get.",3
"A little pricy if you want something in a nontraditional size, but other than that, this place is great. Friendly and helpful staff, great location, and fast.",3
"Palo is the equivalent of a late night booty call, but not a first or second tier candidate. I'm talking about that last resort option that you've never introduced to your friends and rarely carry on a conversation with outside of the bedroom. It's dark, raucous and everything is kind of hazy the next morning. The drinks are stiff and cheap, so you can get your drunk going strong and wake up the next morning with a pounding headache and mystery bruises. \n\nI used to come here all the time when I lived at the corner of Priest and Broadway because it was within walking distance and is the first bar to open on any given day. Ah, the memories. Usually relayed to me second hand. \n\nMy favorite thing about this place is the graffiti. Where else are you going to see a squatting naked chick crawling with the crabs, little claws clinging to all sorts of uncomfortable places? Well on the inside of the stall in the women's restroom is where. \n\nSeconded as, \""the dive-iest of dive bars.\""",1
"I had exactly 30 minutes to spare and it happened to be lunch time, so I figured why not try this little sushi place.  I sat at the sushi bar where my order was taken and filled faster than I could have hoped - had my food within five minutes of arrival. I had a delicious and fabulously priced lunch special of miso soup, spicy tuna roll, and New York roll, the latter of which was the highlight of the meal. Definitely recommended!",4
"being a vegetarian I didn't think I would ever get a chance to try pho.  This place has blown me away and its now my go to place whenever I don't feel like slaving over a hot stove.  Their peanut sauce is delicious with the spring rolls, and I'm never disappointed  with my order.",3
It was ok. Definitely better than subway or quiznos. Nothing I would go out of my way to get.,2
"Having to travel to Vegas for trade shows and regular business, I have never had the opportunity to stay at the Mandalay Bay. This is an MGM owned property and if you enjoy the Bellagio, you'll probably enjoy the Bay. The property is fairly run down and to put this in perspective, it's like sleeping in a smoky version of a Southwest jet. \n\nHere's a small tidbit of how customer service went: I checked in and was sent to the 11th floor. I call the front desk to verify I was put into a non-smoking room, they assure me it is and they'll have housekeeping put in an \""ozone machine\"". The bellman brings my bag after 5-10 minutes. Inquiring as to whether I'm really on a non-smoking floor, the bellman says, \""there's only 2 smoking floors and you are just above one of these\"". \n\nI need to leave, so I tip the guy, unpack and get out of the terrible room. 5 hours later I pop back in for a quick change. It smells the same, so I call the front desk. They ask me if the ozone machine was put in, and I have no way of knowing, but it smells the same. The x'fer me the Tina, the asst head of operations. (Tina should not be in customer service, perhaps the coroner's office is a better fit.) Anyhow, Tina says the hotel is full and basically \""better luck next time\"" and she commits to get the ozone machine up. 5 hours later, I pop back in and the air is better, but the room is still old and gross. I try the front desk once more, but they say they are full and can't move me. Whateva'---I can resolve by not staying here. Back to the review:\n\nThe grounds look nice and the pools and wave pool looked like fun. The resort fee is a \""tacky ask\"" and there are literally no overhead lighting in the sad, dark rooms. I guess they are trying to depress you into dropping coin in their dark, shabby casino.\n\nIf the hotel is crowded, (it was supposedly full on this trip), they aren't quite handling the capacity of tourists. People literally waited 10-15 minutes on elevators through the main elevator zone. The cab line was 20-30 minutes. The elevator piece has to be against code, but fortunately earthquakes in Vegas are rare. (It was an MGM which burned many years, ago).\n\nThe check-in/check-out experience was better than the Bellagio, but it is really a generous stretch to call this a 2 star hotel.\n\nTonight, as I wrote this review a pop-up occurred advertising the Mandalay @ $89/night. That's really cheap and given the fantastic view of the airport runways, probably a reasonable price.",1
"We had a good experience. Hubby had (very expensive) fish and chips. $29 for two pieces of fish and fries. I had Shepard's Pie ($22) which was delicious.\n\nGreat waitstaff and clean restaurant. My only disappointment was the bill: $69 with tip. I have spent less for a 3 course dinner in Vegas and received a comparable, if not better, experience.",2
"As a local, this has been one of my favorite buffets of all times.! It has definitely changed severely over the years, people come and go, I've had family work here & I can assure you it's a clean location, it's not that expensive. There is a variety of food choices, along with fruit, and desserts.! \n\nIt's the perfect spot for a family reunion, or a date with your other half. I go whenever we get a chance to enjoy the Rio & the Carnival buffet. I have not been disappointed, great people seating and serving. I hate tables, love booths. So when I'm place at a table I just ask for a booth and their more then happy to move me.. \n\nTruth is, I love the Carnival Buffet",4
"Ocho Locos does not participate in Maricopa County Environmental Services Restaurant Ratings -- beware.\n\nDo NOT order a martini here. I asked for mine dirty and it arrived filthy! It tasted like 50% olive juice. Disgusting. The spinach enchiladas are truly stuffed with spinach, which is great. Tortillas chips are out of a bag. \n\nI've been here three times and service is lackadaisical.",1
"OMG!! So good!! The garlic rosemary bread knots are fantastic with just the right amount of garlicky rosemary oil and the ranch is the perfect kind of ranch. The kind that isn't too creamy or too dilly or too anything - just right.  And the pizza!! The pizza is out of control delicious! It gives Secret Pizza (at Cosmopolitan) a run for it's money!! The carnivore double slice sounds like a lot of meat (house made sausage, pepperoni, house made meatballs, Niman Ranch bacon, shredded chicken and ham), but there isn't too much of anything! Well, except pizza! The double slice was way too much for even me to eat. And I can eat!  We'll be back!",4
"I came to pick up some teriyaki chicken before driving back to LA. Food quality and taste here was eh. The teriyaki was smothered in sauce and piled on top of rice. It was a little salty. It seems like they just carelessly put together the food. \n\nGiven its location, its intent is to serve students. Hence, generous portions, cheap prices and whatever tasting food.",1
"I can't figure out the hype surrounding the burgers here.  It's at or near the top of more \""Best Burger in Pittsburgh\"" lists than not, and some people have gone so far as to name it the best burger in the state.  I've had burgers at well over 100 places in this state, and let me tell you, Tessaro's isn't even average.\n\nThe ingredients were of good quality, but both creativity in design and skill in preparation were sorely lacking.  I went with a group of five, and not one of us enjoyed the burger.  Also, not one of us got ours cooked as ordered.  I'm willing to accept a variety of interpretations of \""medium rare\"" but no pink and dry throughout is not one of them.\n\nThough shamefully mistreated, the meat's natural flavor, along with non-burger items, rescued Tessaro's from one star territory, but it was pretty obvious the clueless kitchen couldn't hold up to real competition.  (If you want a decent burger, try Burgatory.)",1
"Venue is an A-, Live music is B+, service is a C-, food is a D. How can you mess up basic bar food??? This place is in a great location and has lots of potential. Where's their application for \""Restaurant Impossible? \"" :)",1
"What happened to you Sylvia's?!?! Have been going to Sylvia's for over ten years and have always been a fan. My recent experience was horrible. Service was terrible, was difficult to even get water! Several other tables were in arguments with the manager which made for a less than pleasant experience. Thought the food would still be good but nope! Food was dry and possibly microwaved. I won't ever go back, it's a shame.",0
"Magnum's has a nice selection of beers in virtually all categories that a beer enthusiast would want. Cigars and wine aren't bad either, and their new trendy cigar lounge is nice as well.\n\nAfter several visits I have found the service to be atrocious. For example, today I was there and suspected that my total was slightly off and so I politely requested the receipt. He corrected me by saying I already had it (the credit card receipt) and said that's all he could give me, then followed it up with a nasty look.   Since when is it not possible for a customer to receive an itemized receipt to confirm that there were no double charges or mischarges?\n\nBe careful for old or heat damaged product at Magnum's. Over 90% of their product is maintained at a warm room temperature (today it was 100+ degrees and the front door was open), and I've had several bad bottles from this place. If you stick to the refrigerated product you're less likely to get a bad one, and shopping in summer months can be more risky here as well.\n\nIf you're in the area Magnum's is worth the stop, but be careful what you buy and expect to be treated poorly.",1
"If I could use one word to sum up the opening night at Serrano Manchego, it would be disappointing. Or, underwhelming. You get the idea. I so wanted it to be amazing, but it just wasn't and it could be and should be.\n\nI've gone for 3 stars as I feel it's a compromise between what Serrano Manchego has got right, and what it's got wrong. The d\u00e9cor alone warrants a solid 4, verging on to 5. The service and the food are definitely a 2 (\""meh, I've experienced better\"", I couldn't have said it better myself!).\n\nI'm going to start with the good. The place looks fantastic. It's all exposed brick and wood with the logo stencilled on the wall. Lovely. Lots of space and tables. A definite thumbs up on this. And I love the concept, a Spanish pincho bar on Leith Walk. Only one beer on draught (Alhambra), bite sized snacks and platters, signature croquettas, great! And erm. That's the good. The d\u00e9cor and the concept.\n\nThe bad? Well I'll start with the service. I'm probably not being fair, as yesterday was their opening night (although as stated on their Facebook page this wasn't a soft opening, it wasn't an exclusive party, it was just open), but given the amount of time they've spent into decorating and sourcing ingredients, they really ought to have trained their staff! I'd be surprised if any of the bar staff/servers has worked in a bar or a restaurant before. Not one of them knew how to pour a pint, so the manager had to teach them on the job, and of course this meant that it took ages to get served (and what's with ringing up a transaction on the sole till before pouring the drinks?). And if you'd ordered food you got a numbered wooden spoon in a glass, fairly standard. But the poor girls serving spent most of the evening wandering about in a daze looking for whoever had ordered that particular dish... The staff were all perfectly nice, they were just all woefully inexperienced. I ought to point out that I was with my boyfriend and sister, both experienced bar staff and servers, so as you can imagine we had little tolerance, but even if I'd been there alone I'd still have been frustrated.\n\nAnd the food, oh the food. A great concept doesn't make up for poor execution. There's a nice sounding selection of cold and hot pinchos, as well as tostados, platters and the croquettas of the day. I don't know if this will always be the case, but they only had one croquette on yesterday, which was haggis. Or was it? I was definitely told it was haggis, but biting into it you'd never have known. Sure, the herbs and spices tasted a little like our national dish, but the texture was creamy and the colour was pale and the taste was bland. What was it?! We also ordered a dish of olives. What we got was a small plate (not a bowl, which would have made more sense), of pitted olives that looked and tasted like they'd come straight from a jar. I don't buy jarred olives at the supermarket, I don't expect to be served them in a bar. And pitted, who serves pitted olives?!\n\nI'd like to say everyone else's food look great, but judging by the table next to us that isn't the case. They'd ordered a platter of manchego, blue cheese, walnuts, quince and raisins that came with no blue cheese. There was an explanation for this, but I didn't catch it, and given they'd only been open for 3 hours at this point I sincerely hope they hadn't run out. Then came the tostados, or bread with a topping. Standard, I know, and I wasn't expecting anything brilliant from a basic open sandwich, but they just looked so uninspiring. Fortunately none of the food is expensive.\n\nI actually feel annoyed about it all. I wanted Serrano Manchego to be brilliant. They've had a great Facebook presence and I know I wasn't the only local eagerly awaiting its opening, and it was packed last night. I want to give them a second chance, because I truly believe that they could be great if only they improve. Please guys, the problems I've identified should be easy to fix! I really hope that in a couple of months time I'll be writing an updated review of 4 or 5 stars.",2
"I've been to Hooters a few times but never to this location. My friend and I went here for simple food on a late Friday night. The service was pretty slow but our waitress was friendly. I tried crab legs for the first time and was satisfied. They didn't have crackers for the shells so it was pretty difficult eating crab without crackers. I particularly enjoyed the teriyaki wings, bone in. Never had a problem with the food but just nothing great.\n\nThe one thing I felt weird about was homeless people staring at customers while they ate their food. Our waitress even approached our table after our meal and asked us if we saw anyone take her tip off a table she has just served. She accused the homeless man we saw watching everyone eating of stealing the money. I thought that was low-class and not something that should be mentioed in front of other customers. I also thought management should have asked the homeless people to leave prior to the money being \""stolen\"".\n\nOverall, it was so-so.",2
I spend too much time here. AMAZING atmosphere and bartenders,4
"I am SO disappointed in Anthony's! The ambiance looks really nice from the outside but once you sit down is where the negatives come into play.\n\n1. The hostesses were not friendly and wanted to seat us by the bar in the dark area when the tables with a view of the pool were clearly available. They were not receptive to our desire to sit near the window.\n2. Once we sat down, we tried ordering numerous brews that were on the menu but no longer in stock/not available. If you're going to advertise beer in the name of your establishment, I think its reasonable to expect our first choice brews, not fourth or fifth.\n3. The burgers were made sloppy. The entire bottom half of my bun was drenched in oil (I ordered my burger medium). There is a distinct difference between having a juicy burger that spills onto the bun and straight soggy. Perhaps the food runners or servers just didn't bring our burgers out upon being ready?\n4. This establishment is 21+ only. While I understand that they advertise brews,  it seems unreasonable to prohibit 21 and under after 12pm noon. \n\nOverall, besides the wonderful view the large open windows offer, there is no reason to return.",2
"Sadly, Distrito does not live up to an Iron Chef's restaurant expectations. I've been to this restaurant three times just to verify that I wasn't missing something. I found the pricing to be somewhat reasonable but most of the dishes were hit and miss...mostly miss. \n\nService was subpar each visit and most employees seemed like they didn't want to be there. The restaurant really wasn't too busy so not much excuse for good service. \n\nThe descriptions on the menu make the selections sound appetizing but none of dishes tasted anything like what was described and also found that there was usually an off putting flavor in most dishes. Can't be more descriptive except that every dish ordered seemed to be missing something or had something added that didn't enhance the experience.\n\nThis is the second Chef Garces restaurant I've tried (Chifa in Philadelphia also)  and found both to be just OK. Chifa recently closed in Philadelphia due to poor quality and service and I wouldn't be surprised if Distrito follows suit.",1
"I didn't stay here but when we walked in to check it out, all I could think was - cheeeeeeeeeeeap! The casino had a strong cigarette smoke smell that I couldn't shake and the crowd was definitely different from the one seen at the Wynn. \n\nYes, if in Vegas, you should definitely do a walk-through, but I wouldn't stay there. \n\nSound bougie, but it's the truth!",0
"i come here everytime i come to vegas.  A little loud inside, but the food makes up for everything.",4
I go here all the time. Rex and his crew do a spectacular job. The crew is ver friendly and make you feel like part of the family. Try their pancakes or French toast. It's just like mom makes on Sunday morning :),4
"If your over 55 and enjoy overpriced \""Happy Hour\"" food then this is your place. It is also cramped and crowded at the bar and I spotted a good number of those fruit fleas swirling around the bar area. Place caters to the well heeled and sweater wearing crowd and although it was Monday Night football, no volume was on the small TV and nobody, but me, was really interested in the game. The least expensive food for HH is 6 bucks and that is bowl of soup. Other dishes that came out looked like the ole tiny portions at HH prices swaperoo. I tried their famous Huckleberry margarita and although not bad, it came out of a machine and a swirl of huckleberry or something similar was put on top of drink. Nothing here at this place warrants a return viisit and they should work on that fruit fly problem beacuse that is a major issue swatting them away sitting at the bar.",0
Both Brothers are really professional and courteous. And the girls that fit you with the classes are really funny and patient withe the clients while choosing your classes. I now live in California but I am planning a visit to Vegas for more glasses and sunglasses.,4
"I took my truck in to get a wheel bearing replaced. The first red flag was when I overheard a conversation the store manger was having with a customer. This went on for about 5 mins which included arguing and telling the customer he was wrong. \n\nI dropped the name of the GM who i knew here in Vegas hoping I would get taken care of. They told me that they would take $100 dollars off the quote and it would be complete by the end of the day. Surprise surprise I didn't get my truck back until 4 pm the following day. Also, surprisingly the total increased by exactly $100; the same amount I told would he taken off the bottom-line. \n\nThis review isn't a bash on Big O Tires, but an experience I had at this one store. The alignment wasn't to my satisfaction but due to this experience I'll pay money to take it somewhere else before I step foot in that store again.",0
"First i would like to say that i never went there because of what happen.\n\nA few months ago i was planning a business lunch for me and my partners and i have heard great thing about this restaurant. Willing to try it i decided to called them.\n\nNo one answer so i left a message and the voicemall also mention the restaurant open tuesday at 5pm and so it there website.\n\nTuesday at 5pm i was around so i decided to go to the restaurant and book my reservation to my surprise no one was there at 5pm i stayed in front of the store until 5h30pm and called several time but no one answer. There was no message on the door or in the voicemail...\n\nA bit frustrated i left and was wondering maybe they closed the restaurant and went on vacation or something like that anyhow i went to eat somewhere else that night.\n\nAt the end of my dinner since i was still in downtown i decided to give it another shot!\nTo my surprise all the door was closed and no one was there!\n\nI can't believe how a restaurant can do that!\nIf you are going to close the restaurant at least write something on a piece of paper and put it on the front door so people know or change the voice mail it takes like 5 min!\nI can understand that changing information on the website isn't the easiest thing to do but don't tell me no one could have write a message and stick it on the door?!\n\nAnyways, i decided to book at another restaurant.\n\nCheers,\n\nEric Van Nguyen",0

"Great looking place, great sevice.  Food expensive and very small portions. \n\nIf you're into this kind of place it's worth a try if you see something you like on the menu.

"Tried this place first time last week. My partner had a veggie burger and found the spice and texture nearly unpalatable. My pulled pork was fairly good; cole slaw very weird, acid-y like vinegar, I didn't like it. Our friend liked his burger. Service TERRIBLE - three people(? huh???) waited on us, lost the first order and had to come back 5-10 min later and re-take the whole order. Got part of it wrong. Was hard to get anyone's attention to get another beer - and they didn't come around to ask. All in all, REALLY MEDIOCRE - I'll go somewhere else.",1
"I would only come here for the AYCE bbq.  I usually go after 10 for the 13.99 deal.  It's normally 16.99.  They have a lot of different meats, but my personal favorites are brisket, beef tongue, and pork belly.  My friends like the bulgogi.  I forgot what the term was.  They have really good salad that I adore.  I also love the different side dishes that they have.  You can also order the soup. It's really good.  \n\nI also like the steamed egg and short ribs, but they only serve those for 16.99.  The customer service is really good. They are always on top of making sure people have water.\n\nThey also have a non-Korean bbq side which serves meat items, bibimpap, and soondubu which is tofu soup.  I would not come here for the tofu soup because the soup has too much spicy pepper taste and doesn't really have a good soup base.",3
"Lei has done an incredible job!  The simplicity, creativity, style, and taste is unmatchable.  The store is very nice and clean! Plenty of room to sit and enjoy your creation!  I Totally challenge the skeptical to taste them, you'll be hooked.\nKeep up the good work!",4

"My parents and I dined at Firefly over labor day weekend. We called to make a reservation, but learned they do not take reservations on weekends. We decided we better arrive early so we wouldn't have to wait. We showed up right at 5 and were seated immediately, but by 6 the restaurant was full! \nThe three of us split the following menu items: Artichoke Toasts, Stuffed Dates, Roasted Eggplant Cannoli, Pork Empanadas, Shrimp Tempura, Filet Mignon Sliders, Passion Fruit Cheesecake, Gelato, and Caramel Flan. \nWe loved everything! Our favorite item was the Stuffed Dates, definitely give those a try! My parents enjoyed the Sangria and I had a delicious cappuccino (it's ok if it's after 10am in the states, right?). The service was wonderful and fast, and our waiter was very informative. The prices are very reasonable. I would return to this restaurant.",4
Ordered take away at 2110 on Thursday evening. 14 inch seafood. \u00a316. prompt service but not great value for a slightly too soft pizza. I suppose that crisp delivery pizza is almost a contradiction in terms.,2
"It became obvious that this is a groomer set up for dogs under 30lbs when I took in my 50lb dog and was charged extra fees at the end because of her size. When I first walked in the owner asked me if I had seen a white dog running around outside, this was disturbing. The owner was slightly pushy, I showed up 2 hours after I dropped my dog off which was the time quoted for a bath. I had made a appointment and when I got there they told me she was still in line and i would be called when she was finished I was than shooed out of the store. I was not impressed, I would not recommend this place for my friends and their dogs",1
"Was driving down the road and noticed this place with a patio full of flat screen televisions. The goal - find a bar with good TVs to watch some Sunday football... Oh boy. What a treat?! Great TVs, high definition and excellent viewing angles. Perfect for your Sunday football fix. If you are into fantasy they have every game on in Hd on gorgeous new flat screens. The waitress was extremely attentive making sure that every low beer was followed by a prompt cold full beer. With the name House of Brews you would assume they would have a range of beers and that assumptions is correct. They have both a diverse selection of draft and bottle beers.\n\nUsually bars that have a lot of micro beers have a pretty decent menu and...drum roll please.. Legit. Legit menu. They have Lobster Rolls! Yes! I have been looking for a Lobster Roll in the Phoenix area for 5 years. The price point is good and the lobster roll has a decent amount of lobster meat with the right amount of seasoning and dressing. I know I said decent and generally that's associated with bad but the fact they had the hoagie roll toasted with fresh lobster prepared the right right way does it for me. If we lived by a body of water I would expect more but we don't so I will settle with fresh and tasty. My inner fat kid went on full assault with an order of the clam roll, clam chowder, burger, Mac and cheese and onion rings. Yes, yes and yes. 5 stars. Period. Great crunch, seasoned breading, thick juicy burger, creamy Mac and delicious chowder. I'm not from Boston but it reminds me of every visit when I'm there... I definitely recommend this place.",4
"It's Chinese alright. \n\nI meant its alright Chinese. \n\nBut must admit, it wasn't greasy. Nice, clean flavors. \n\nWe had the \n\n(Entree) Honey Walnut Shrimp - Nothing exciting. Better than Panda, not as good as Chinese Restaurant in Chinatown (PhoKim Long is good). Came with good portioned white rice.\n\n(Entree) Tofu Veggies - Good. Came with good portioned white rice. \n\n(Side) Veggie Roll (2) - Was ok. The norm, bean sprout, carrots. \n\nFor the price we paid for different entree. We will try the Family Value which is a dollar more, but had more of the sides.",2
"Dear Swagat where have I been I didn't meet you before?? I just wanted to say I am so happy I did today :) :) :) :) :) :) :) :)\nI have tried other indian buffets and I could taste the big difference. It is the same price as the other Indian restaurants but I don't mind as long as it is quality food and it was indeed. My hubby and I were seated in a table where all the people passed by next to us but I enjoyed the food so much I felt the world around me disappeared and I just focused on the fireworks this amazing food made me see.\n\nThings that really pop compared to other Indian buffets, chicken tikka masala, it was so tender and the sauce so well done (others tend to be lemony), Vegetable pakora and samosas (the breading was thin enough to taste the beautiful flavors of the veggies and also so golden and crunchy!)  paneer kadahi ( nice small cottage cheese pieces with a heavenly creamy sauce). Their biryani rice was colorful with small chicken pieces and it tasted soo good! My God I don't even know how to continue explaining how good the food was, in a sentence, it was such a pleasure to eat such a variety of flavors in every single bite.......mmmm, I suspect this new acquaintance and I will become good friends....to be continued......",4
"How dare they put rye seeds on an everything bagel? I'm not happy about dealing with that party foul at all or the rude, inefficient service. Plus, even though they are boiled here, these are not good bagels at all,  even if the rye seeds were not present. Other issue is the bagel bins are far away from customers eyes - what are hiding - put the bins up front like every true NY bagel shop. Hey, if your gonna call yourself a NY bagel place (yes I am from NY) then I want the whole experience. Charging $11 for a turkey sandwich is a bit much too and this is an unfriendly, cold location with no charm. There was a very hairy bird outside though looking for crumbs and on this day that bird got lucky. Onto the next place.",0
"Not sure what everyone's problem is I thought it was fine.  Great place for quick Mediterranean food. Walked in with a friend and the place looked very clean. There was a woman cleaning the tables and a man behind the counter.  I asked the man about some of the food and he was more than friendly! \n\nWe ended up ordering a Shawarma plate and a combo dinner (Kifta and Chicken) to go. The man said we had to wait about 10 mins for the Chicken to grill and was very apologetic about having us wait.  It was no problem! When the food was ready he gave to us with another apology for the wait and told us to enjoy.\n\nThe food was great. Shawarma came with a lot of meat, Hummus, bread, Salad and Tzaki sauce. Combo dinner came with grilled chicken, kifta (I guess you can say its like meatloaf patty), rice, salad, salad dressing separately, Tzaki sauce, and some garlicy white stuff that tasted good, but I have no idea what it was. \n\nDidn't rate 5 stars because, while I won't say its was expensive, it wasn't the cheapest place around and the selection was all that big. I'll definitely be coming again though.",3
"I threw a Bachelorette party here last August with 23 girls, so we booked 5 rooms. We got to Vegas early so we ate first, then checked in at 3. As per our initial reservations (MONTHS in advance) I requested that all rooms be on the same floor, and have 4 of the 5 rooms have those connecting doors (2 and 2). At time of check in, they only had 3 rooms ready for us. 1 single room, and 2 that connected, and informed us that our last rooms will be ready in the next hour or so. So we all went up stairs, and pretty much crashed in those 3 rooms. After an hour or so we called down to the front desk to check the status of our rooms. NOTHING. No progress. They said another hour. So we called back around 5:30. Still no progress. I then asked to speak to a manager. He said he'd get right on it, and have housekeeping clean some of the rooms for us to settle in. Shouldn't the rooms already be cleaned as check IN is at 3?! This went on UNTIL EIGHT O'CLOCK at night. Which was ridiculous. Its impossible for 23 girls to rest, and get ready for a night in Vegas in 3 cramped rooms. We were NOT happy. So I called and requested late check out for all 5 rooms. I had to ask 3 times until someone said ok, we'd give each room an extra hour, when I had initially asked for 2. By that time I was beyond frustrated and settled for 1 hour. The rooms itself were decent. Nothing too fancy. Good sized tv, comfortable enough beds. The casino was decent as well, my friend won 1200 on slots, so that was a perk. Buffet was good, nothing spectacular, but it fed us, the employees at the buffet were very nice, and very hospitable. The buffet I'd give 4 stars to. The pool was nice too. Not too packed, but not barren either. The best perk was the late night Pho restaurant they had in the casino, nice meal after a long night of partying.\n\nOther than that, I wouldn't stay here again if I had to",0
"The service was friendly and relatively fast but the food was mediocre. Good prices and close to my hotel. Adequate if you need a quick, hot meal.",1
"Shaw Butte has is a nice ~2 mile one-way hike. It has wide, well-worn paths, but also many loose rocky areas. A small portion of the journey is rather steep. At the top of the Butte, there is a huge collection of metal towers and satellite dishes, making it not the best place for a photographic view. Instead, try taking one of the lesser worn paths near the top of the mountain. There are a few clear 360 views of Phoenix from different areas on the Butte. This trail is plenty large enough, but expect to see a lot of friendly people going up and down. If you're looking for a serene, secluded location, this is not the place. However, if you are working out or patient with others moving about, you are in good company.",2
"This is my 2nd time ordering the cake from this store, also it is my final time cause I will not do that again! Today I went to pick up my order, I found that they forgot to put the topper, I brought it back and hope they can fix it, however the women behind the counter totally didn't care about it and claimed that the cake should have been finished without topper, what she saying is ridiculous and I was disappointed by her attitude, since the picture shows exactly the cake is decorated with some kind of topper.",0
"Daniel and I must've gone to The Flipside Cafe on the exact same rainy Sunday since it looks like we got the exact same crummy service.  I, too, was so excited to see a fun, new place opening in Fort Mill, and the fella and I went with his parents for Sunday breakfast at 10:00 a.m., right when they opened.  Luckily, we beat the rush, but that didn't make service any better.\n\nWhen we walked in and said we had 4 people, they had to figure out whether to seat us at a 6-top or put two 2-tops together.  There was only one other group of 4 in the restaurant, and I thought it was odd that their seating was so limited.  They sat us at a 6-top in the back, and after some seat adjusting, we were perusing the menu.\n\nOur waitress took the drink orders for only 3 of us, and the 4th had to shout after her that he'd like some water.  It took far too long to get our coffee, and then it was only half full.  Among the four of us, we had orders for two waffles, one pancake and one Eggs Benedict; after literally 30 minutes, some of our food finally came.  They said they burnt one of the waffles and had to redo it, which I appreciate, but I just couldn't figure out what took so long when hardly anyone else was in the restaurant.\n\nThe menu was creative, and the food was delicious, which is where the two stars are coming from.  Our waitress hardly ever came to check on us and never refilled our coffee without us having to track her down (it's in carafes on the counter, so we should've just refilled it ourselves).  When one of us asked for \""hot coffee\"" since what we were getting was lukewarm, our waitress had a bit of an attitude and said, \""Well, it was hot when I poured it.\""  Nice.\n\nI'll give The Flipside Cafe one more chance and hope this crummy service was because they haven't been open that long, but my hopes aren't high.  Bummer.",1
Best place in town to get a  group of friends together and go watch the game!!!!!,4
"Great atmosphere, friendly staff go during happy hour and save some $$$",4
"Good food, huge buffet one of the biggest around but a little bland to appeal to everyone. There is also a Mongolian grill inside and sushi.   The sushi was not very good though go somewhere else if your a big sushi fan",2
"This has got to be one of the best hotels that I have been to. I probably wouldn't go here on my own. I was here only because of a bachelor party. We were lucky to get two small suites to accommodate 9 guys. I think we could fit 12. Anyhow we were able to get side by side rooms and were able to move between the two fairly easily. They both were exact rooms but just mirror images of each other. There were 3 flat screens in each room. One in front of the beds, one near the desk and couches and one in the bathroom.\n\nI did like the fact that we were close to the strip. We walked everywhere and didn't have to take taxis anywhere. Last time I was in Vegas, we stayed at the MGM Grand suites. They were nice but the cost of staying there caused us to take taxis because it was so far. \n\nWe walked everywhere from this hotel and also stayed here a lot. It had everything we needed. \n\nThe pool area is nice and we were lucky to book a cabanna for the day. We had a tv and a private area to tan and lay out. I guess it was nice because we didn't have to worry about finding a spot. Plus we were close to the pool and had a great view of the people. \n\nWe also visisted the shops in the Palazzo which were located on the second floor. There was an abundance of high end shops and some affordable ones. We really didn't visit too many just one. I ended up getting some dress shoes at the Coal Haan store. Great place for dress shoes!\n\nI would definitely come back again. I don't gamble much so I can't say much about the experience. \n\nAnother thing that was nice was the fact that the floors were separated into three sections. We were able to get to our floor which was on 20 and then not have to worry about a full elevator or waiting too long to get on one.\n\nI did like the beds and they were very comfortable. The bathroom was nice. I didn't like the fact that the toilet door didn't have a lock. There were 9 guys which shared two bathrooms. The door closed on its own so you didn't know if somebody was using it. I liked the shower a lot but didn't mess with the tub at all. The tvs were great and we were able to watch some things especially football. They had some hd channels so that was cool. I wish we had a large fridge but it was ok.",3
While the ice cream looked delicious - there was no frozen yogurt.  I was led astray!  But this place sure is popular - the line was out the door.  I am on a quest for a local yogurt joint - not sure why Yelp lists this as both a yogurt & ice cream shop.,0
"This review is for the entertainment only.  Friday night karaoke was outstanding.   You sing on stage with a live band.  There are definitely some regulars here - the mid 50's guy with the semi-Billy Idol haircut who sang an Idol song (quite well) and a few others.  5 stars to the biker looking dude who sang \""Welcome to the Jungle\"" and put Axl Rose to shame.  5 stars as well to the guy who got on stage wearing cowboy boots and big black cowboy hat.  I was expecting some straight-up honky tonk country until he invited everyone to give  him the middle finger, announced it was his birthday and then rocked Motley Crue's \""Shout at the Devil\"".\n\nThere were some people that absolutely had no business being on stage, but that's how it is every night at karaoke night, no matter where you are.",4
"We found nothing to like about TeePee. We tried take out twice because it was near work. We were not impressed either time. So far we've tried the machaca taco, cheese enchilada, green chili burro and chicken burro. Everything including both salsas were lacking in flavor and the chips were stale, like last night's or last week's. Overall, the food tasted like something you'd get at a fast food joint like Taco Bell. Actually, Taco Bell is better. \n\nThe service was not so hot either. Neither time did they have our order ready when we arrived even though we had called ahead and been given a pick up time. We will definately NOT be going there again. BTW - we tried their famous chile relleno a few years back and were equally unimpressed. It was just a whole lot of whipped egg whites with a little green chili and ordinary cheese. The sauce was okay but not enough to try again. Don't bother going.",0
"Pretty space, great outdoor  seating, bad service, and so-so food. Our waitress was apathetic at best, let's leave it at that. \n\nThe best thing on the menu is the $2 crusty bread and good olive oil. It's to die for. Almost Tartine (SF) status. I love the antipasti set up - you can order a series of small bites to share while waiting on your main courses, and they'll serve them all up on one platter with side plates. We ordered the aforementioned bread, some Humboldt Fog (oh so good), beets, olives, and asparagus, and everything was delicious.\n\nThen things started going downhill. The Italian chopped salad is seriously weak - the ingredients aren't actually chopped, it's surprisingly gloopy from the preserved bell peppers and artichoke hearts they had added in, and despite the multitude of ingredients, it didn't really taste like anything. The ricotta gnocchi had an overpowering amount of sausage, and there were more mushroom bits than gnocchi.  The trout was alright, nothing impressive. The fish and chips looked really good, but again, kind of flavorless. The only thing really up to snuff was the Pub Burger, which I would definitely recommend. \n\nThis place is probably cool on a Saturday night, but I would just recommend ordering carefully and finding a waitress who is knowledgable about and can advise you on the menu.",2
"This was my third time here. \n\nThe service was not like it was before. Our server had too many tables and wasn't able to properly serve. \n\nThe fried pickles are amazing!\n\nOne thing that I really dislike are the buns. They seem very cheap and store bought, definitely not fresh. I would love to have a few different bun options, such as wheat or sour dough. \n\nFor a $50 lunch before tip I feel a little short changed.",2
"Simply put:  The food here is out of this world delicious.  I'm not vegan but I try to eat healthy and after eating here, I would say that if my meals were guaranteed to be this good every time, I could go vegan/raw.  The downside is that I could only bring myself to eat lunch here maybe twice a year. That's the most I'm willing to pick up a quick lunch for $22.    I sat by myself, had a chai tea and a Vital Force Salad.  $22 (inc. tip).  I felt violated when I walked out the door.  Sorry, but $22 is too much for a salad and a drink. Even for the best salad I've ever had.  A salad and a drink in the $10-$15 range, I could feel okay about and would then eat here 1-2 times a week but at $22, I just feel robbed.  :( So sad.",2
"Fresh Basil and Tomato Pizza from Cugino's should have a star on the Pizza Walk of Fame. 5 Star pie all the way. \n\nThe shopping center it's hiding in holds years of memories to me. I use to chain smoke Cloves at Cafe Copio when I was in my teens and consume large quantities of cheap beer listening to the Beastie Boys at Tom n Jerry's when I was barely 21. The days when I had less bills and belly fat. My Doc Martens and I ruled the world. Great memories were had here. This made picking up this pizza that much better. On to the pizza.\n\nWhen I walked into Cugino's for the first time I was overwhelmed with all of the authentic cheeses, meats, breads, pastas. This was the moment I realized I am not just a foodie, but a gigantic food pervert. This is Food Pervert Heaven!!! Just walk in and you will know what I mean.\n\nFresh Tomato and Basil Pizza- Large for $16.99. Do not make any changes to it. Everything about this dime piece is bangin just the way she is. If you don't like garlic than this isn't the Za for you and we are not friends. I happen to LOVE garlic and this sexy pie is packed with it. Then they throw fresh, earthy basil and firm tommies to the mix and walla. The perfect pie. Don't even get me started on the crust. Let's just say every great painting starts with a fine canvas. I love this pizza.  It's simple and simply phenomenal and everyone I shared it with agreed. \n\nWhen I was driving home with the pie I felt like I had the hottest date in my car. Seriously, the aroma gently traveling from that box to my nostrils made me high and I couldn't stop smiling from ear to ear.\n\nI can't wait to do this dance again only next time I will be rockin out to Violent Femmes remembering the good ole days in my hometown.  Kudos to Yelp (Rex's review) for leading me to Cugino's. Nacho C. and his birds would have loved this food. Mad props to Cugino's for making an incredible pie. All the other pie shops can sleep with the fishes.",4

Very excited about the deals & the these few items will make a difference in my living room. Go now before the sale ends.",4
"The BIGGEST club I have ever been too.  Multiple floors with an awesome outdoor area with a pool smack dab in the middlle. The dance floors get packed, especially the one playing hip hop music. The night me and my 6 galpals went, DJ Kascade happened to be there doing his thing. The best part of the night were the STRONG DRINKS our bartender kept giving us.\n\nAs for getting in to the club, we had a promoter who told us to be in a certain line at a certain time so we wouldn't have to pay a cover. We got there by the expected time only to be corralled in a large line with other groups of people whose own promoters also told them the same thing. After a 20 minute wait we eventually got in, although there were lines a plenty with people crammed in every single line.  \n\nI'd come back just for the rather large outdoor area, but the lines to get into the club are pretty ridiculous even if you know a promoter.",2
I went there today for brunch.  There was a crowd of people in the lobby and all the tables were still empty. I ordered pancakes short stack it came out with three  little pancakes that look more like they were a side order then an actual order. It literally came with a half a teaspoon of butter and about 2 tablespoons of syrup. My first bite of the pancakes the bottom one was burn so I figured I would eat the top 2 and just not complain. My next bike I got a mouth full of onion flavored pancakes obviously no one cleaned the grill it was disgusting. The manager came over and offered to remake them. I said no thank you as my friends were done eating and wanted to leave. She removed it from the bill but still charged me for my iced tea.. This is a very nice looking restaurant with awful food I will never ever eat at BJs again it's disgusting I wouldn't spend my money here. I  have had their pizza in the past... Go to Pizza Hut it's better and much cheaper,0
Ridiculously convenient and well-priced.  I would order a taxi after having a few too many drinkies and needed a ride home.  Your drivers were always kind and on time.  Best in Scottsdale.,4
Incredible lunch today at the new Mac Shack on west Charleston. Food was ridiculously good and the value and service was equally as impressive with kids eating free on Sunday and a ton of gluten free options. Curbside pick up too for takeout. Definitely one of our new fav spots.,4
"Wanted to try Thailicious based on the reviews, sadly we were very disappointed. Went in on a Friday night around 5:30, one other table was seated when we arrived. Most of the staff seemed disinterested in serving us and were running back and forth between the kitchen and dining area. Our server only half paid attention and served us one order of spring rolls instead of the 2 we ordered. Very mediocre at  $5.99 for two rolls, glad she only brought one order. It sounds like an exaggeration but we sat and waited for our entrees while other tables seated after us were served and eating.\n\nWe had one of the most expensive dishes on the menu, a Thai seafood entree that I can't remember the name of right now. It had a nice chili spice but was heavy with sugar which was overpowering. The Drunken noodles were OK but nothing special. Sadly we have no desire for another trip to Thailicious, there are much better Thai and Vietnamese offerings in the east valley.",1
"1.) Nothing comes with your $45 \""membership\""\n2.) Aweful costumer service - literally grabbed food from under guest and threw it away.\n3.) Bad experience\n\nGreat concept for entertainment. However, our group member accidently grabbed food from the buffet in the back, he didn't realize it was for a private party. One of the employees came over and understandably reprimanded him. He apologized for the mistake, offer to pay for it and apologize to party. Although I tried to stop the employee, they took the fresh food from under him and threw it right in the garbage! \n\nThey ignored our solution and chose an ignorant one. When I reminded the manager that people die from starvation  + an animal was slaughtered for the food,  he claimed there was no other way to handle the incident.\n\n..so the answer was to GRAB THE FOOD FROM UNDER YOUR GUEST AND THROW IT IN THE TRASH??! Riiiiggghhtt...never going there again.",0
It's hit or miss with the staff!! Food is good but service lacks!!!,1
"I wish I would have been lucky enough to come in on a day when the staff felt like treating customers with courtesy and respect.\n\nI walked in with my sisters and my fiance earlier this month.  One of my sisters and me have always toyed with the idea of owning a Birkin bag so we wanted to personally see if it was truly worth all the fuss.  Well, I'm not sure if I plan on ever getting one based on the way we were treated once we entered the boutique.  We were the only ones in the entire store and there were two women standing behind the counter, an older white woman and a filipino woman.  They barely glanced at us, much less greet us, when we walked in, even though they weren't doing anything.\n\nI lingered around the scarves for awhile, then the bags, waiting for someone to ask if I needed help.  Never happened.\n\nAfter about 10 minutes of being completely ignored, we decided it was time to leave.  NEWS FLASH to bitchy luxury salespeople out there: Just because you SELL luxury goods doesn't mean you're worth more than the customers coming in to BUY them.  (I get the same treatment from Gucci, btw.  Louis Vuitton, Dior, and Chanel, on the other hand, have superb customer service because their salespeople understand the meaning of COMMISION.  But that's a whole 'nother story.)\n\nI didn't care much for their bag collection, the colors that they had available seemed rather drab, in my opinion.  And although my family and I do drop serious bank on luxury goods now and then, I realize that in the end, a purse is a purse.  Whether you get it from Hermes or Target.  To tell you the truth, it takes some kind of a**hole to buy a bag worth as much as a car just to shove their financial superiority (or major debt) in other people's faces.  I mean, what other purpose would purchasing a $14K (and up) purse serve?  \n\nPersonally, I just don't feel like being THAT kind of a**hole.",0
"It's a Shell Station. What do you expect? There's always somebody there. They know where all 30 items are. I've never had a BAD experience at this location, but I've never had my mind blown, either",2
"Its so cozy here, perfect place to stop and clear my head before a hard days work!  Usually they have someone walking around with souflee samples, i was out of luck today :( Panera bread is at the top of my list for interesting & hearty soups plus they have a mean sweet selection.  I am into the tasty coffee cake! \nI heart this place so much, i am able to give them a good review, eventhough my multi colered hair cashier was a complete NINCOMPOOP!",3
"Amazing yoga place! They have a huge studio that's very clean, and is perfect for working out! They also have jewelry and a hangout area too.",4
"It is restaurant week and we finally went and had a good experience. \nFirst- I like that it is BYOB, we got to bring a great bottle of french wine and not pay the mark up but simply a $10 corkage (however, next time I will bring my own glasses, not a fan of thick glass wine glasses).\nFor appetizers we had the tomato goat cheese tart and mussels. They were both very tasty.\nFor the main course we had the lamb shank and the chilean sea bass. The lamb shank was fall of the bone tender and wonderfully flavorful - the sea bass on sea bean salad was really really good- very well composed and balanced.\nThe desserts were very good too - Hadden liked the peanut butter chocolate the best and I like the Brown Butter Peach. \nGood food, nice intimate but casual setting. This is a definite Phoenix must-try and a great date spot.",3
"This location is almost always busy but the service is quick! Their employees are always on top of their game. From point of order to receipt of food is very fast, food quality is always good, I don't think i've ever gotten warm or cold food here, always comes out piping hot. Do yourself a favor and get some cane's sauce to dip your fingers/fries in...that stuff is the business. And if you're a fan of sweet tea, Cane's is the best outside of the south. And they also offer military discount with ID but only on combo's.",3

Not worth the troubles. Waited TWO hours for a delivery. Finally had to cancel the order. There just is no reason for a pizza delivery place in the Las Vegas Valley to take that long to make pizza and deliver it. There are plenty of other places to get a pizza delivered. Steer clear of Monte's Pizza Restaurant.,0
"I was kind of disappointed coming here. It was featured in both guide books I had for Scotland and it seemed like it might be the kind of kitschy tourist spot that had a charm all it's own, but it really didn't. Maybe it's better for dinner, but at lunch the place was a bit empty and sterile. The beer selection was only so-so, but that's par for the course in Scotland and most of the UK.\n\nThe bacon burger was really only mediocre and cost nearly \u00a310. The bun wasn't even a little warm and seemed like it might be a day over the hill. The bacon was undercooked to the point of being a bit stringy and getting in the way of easily eating the burger and the actual patty was a bit dry and lacked any real flavor.\n\nThe only high-point was that the waiter we had was very nice and chatted with us about where we were from and then about the Seattle music scene for a bit.",1
"I rated Toast a three star since I usually enjoy this restaurant but my experience today was absolutely terrible.  My husband and I brought two friends from out of the country and we were excited to show them one of our favorite brunch spots.  Being New Years day, I knew it would be busy but didn't expect to receive the terrible service and experience that we received today.  After waiting patiently for over an hour and 15 minutes (we were quoted 45 min.) we were seated to be greeted by a VERY nude waitress.  We asked to order our food with our drinks and were told (with an eye roll) that it wouldn't help our food come out faster so no need to do that.  We learned that several items we wanted were no longer available (they were out of them).  When our meals showed up with even different sides than we ordered we were then told more items were also \""out\"".  It would have been nice to have been given another option besides them picking something else to bring out.  No servers ever came back by (literally during the entire meal) and  no one ever stopped by to apologize for the issues with our meal.  We are all very laid back people but this was not an experience I wanted to give to new friends experiencing Toast for the first time.  All restaurants have bad moments but this was really disappointing to me. I won't be back.",2
"This is your typical hostel. You can get single/double rooms, or stay in the super cheap 6 person rooms. This place is pretty sound proof and had no problems sleeping. There is a bar downstairs with super nice bartenders there to answer any questions til midnight at least normally.\n\nThey also have a shuttle service that will drop off and pick you up at any nearby stations and sometimes the tourist destinations if they're not busy and in a good mood. Which is helpful as its out on the edge of town. We had not one issue here and had a great time! We met a lot of new friends too. There was lots of room to socialize if you wanted to, and room to be by yourself if that was your preference.",3
Got it for dinner tonight- can't wait to drown ounce of my chicken bowl in extra teriyaki sauce that they have out for free!,4
We love Barnes and Noble but this store does not deserve to carry the name.  It's a terrible representation and if Barnes and Noble cares anything about their brand reputation they should get to this story immediately and clean it up!  Please start in the bathrooms!  Horrendous!,1
"Two awful experiences.  Both times I arrived 15 minutes before my scheduled appointment.  I was not taken in to be seen until 30 minutes after my appointment time.  After I was taken in the room, I waited an additional 20 minutes before the nurse came in, a brief history was taken down, and then she left.  I waited another 20 minutes for the actual veterinarian to come in.  The whole time I sat there, I watched through the door window to the back room as the doctor and assistants chatted and giggled (no paperwork in hand, no talk of medicine or animals).  This was extremely frustrating.  The vet came in and apologized claiming there was an emergency that came in (obvious lie, as they were simply chatting and giggling the whole while).  \nNot only was the wait frustrating, but twice I asked them to run tests on my dog for his reverse sneeze, and twice they claimed \""must be allergies, heres an antihistamine\"", and sent me on my way with a \""we'd like you to come back in two weeks\"".  Kiss my butt, I will not be returning to your poorly run, sad excuse of veterinary services.",0
"This is an UPDATE on January 21, 2011, to my earlier reveiw that follows below.\n\nAfter the terrible experience we had on Thanksgiving, I wrote the Buca de Beppo corporate headquarters and sent them a copy of this review.\n\nI was frankly surprised to receive a personal reply from the company's Regional Director.\n\nIn addition to apologizing for the bad experience, she refunded the money we paid for our Thanksgiving dinner and sent us a gift card asking that we give them a second chance.\n\nWhile there was no excuse for the issues we encountered last Thanksgiving at the Mesa location, the parent company clearly cares about their customers so if you have a problem, WRITE THE COMPANY and you might be pleasantly surprised.\n\nAs for our return visit, took my dad there for his birthday and we had an OK time... not as good as I remember, but still enjoyable.\n***************************************************************************\nReview for 11/25/10\n\n2 or 3 years ago, we'd have rated Buca a good solid 3-4 stars for value, but my oh my how low they have fallen.\n\nI don't often rant about a restaurant unless I feel completely taken advantage of. That said, here I go.\n\nOrdered the Turkey Feast for Thanksgiving because in the past Buca always represented a good value. \n\nHA WHAT A JOKE!  Their use of the word Feast borders on deceptive advertising. \n\nA \""Feast\"" as defined by Webster:\n\na : an elaborate and usually abundant meal often accompanied by a ceremony or entertainment : banquet \nb (1) : something that gives unusual or abundant enjoyment\n\nThey should be calling it a Turkey appetizer, but before I expound further, I want to explain that my wife and I usually share an entree, so you'll know neither of us is a big eater. We went to Buca because we expected to have lots of leftovers over the weekend. NOT\n\nBuca claims it can feed 3 but I could have eaten the six (6) MINISCULE, REHEATED, COOL slices of white meat and 4 tablespoons of dressing by myself. What a RIP-OFF for $24.95!!\n\nThe extra side of salad was missing the usual pepperocini (only contained 1) so we had to request some on the side.\n\nThe baked Rigatoni pasta was DRY, DRY, STICK IN YOUR THROAT DRY and we had to request extra suace.\n\nAnd let's not forget the bread... whoever currently orders this for Buca doesn't know the meaning of Italian bread. What they served wasn't much more firm than Wonder bread and certainly a far cry from REAL, Crusty, Coarse Italian bread like you find at Brio, Maggianos or any other restaurant with Italian roots. You can find better Italian bread at COSTCO than at this place... in fact, they'd make a huge improvement in the authenticity of the meal by getting their bread from COSTCO instead of the bakery they are using.\n\nAnd yes, we could have sent all the food back, but we decided to be Thankful for our ability to go out and enjoy a beautiful day, as well as not cause a scene in the restaurant and spoil anyone else's enjoyment of the holiday. Our response instead  will be to never visit one of their restaurants again.\n\nPLEASE do yourself and your family a favor by avoiding Buca de Beppo at all costs. This company should be out of business so something better could fill the space.\n\nGo to your local Italian restaurant, run by a local family, rather than this corporate theme restaurant that has forgotten the quality and value that made them famous in the beginning.\n\nIf we could rate ZERO stars we'd have done so.",1
"I said NO MAYO, and I got TONS of mayo in my sandwich. It took forever to get the 6 sandwiches I ordered, but next time I know you can place orders in advance.\n\nI prefer Lenny's. My sandwich was soggy.",1
Had good pizza here and food was good but what took a few stars off was the person that took my order was completely clueless couldn't even tell me my total and when he did the delivery guy told me a different total not to mention he said next time tell me ur appt is in the back very rudley.,2
"we dined there on a recent friday night.  Our relatively simple order took about an hour.  There was never an explanation provided as to why the meals were taking so long.  ALSO, just outside the main door and among all of the outdoor dining tables were about 15 cigarette butts.  Not too appetizing.  clean it up!  and don't let your staff smoke in front of the door.   We enjoy the food, but it can't take an hour to prepare a salad and pork schnitzel.",1
"We have had our children seen at Pediatric Medical Associates for 4 years now. I travel further now just to have them be seen by the Doctors and Nurse there because they are the BEST DOCTORS, not just because a Magazine says so. THEY ARE GREAT DOCTORS! There aren't many providers that will go above and beyond like theirs do. They truely care for my children as if they are family. YES...sometimes there is a wait that might seem unbareable while, as parents, we are concerned about our children being uncomfortable. Its our responsibility to use common sense and know when to go to the E. R. and not wait for an office visit. A good doctor will inform you of these thing, as Dr. Saba did for our family. I worked in the dental feild so I understand there is nothing you can do about the wait some times. There is only a wait because these Doctors take the time to be thurough with the patient they are seeing at the time. When your child is the child in the office getting the attention they deserve, it makes up for it!!!! From our family in these hard time....TRUELY THANK YOU!",4
"This was my first visit to a korean bbq restaurant.  I enjoyed the food and the different sides of veggies.  We got the three some with the ribs, marinated beef and spicy marinated chicken.  That was enough to feed a family of four.  Restaurant was clean and everything looked pretty new.  My biggest complaint is the service. Once business picked up for dinner, our waitress was gone.  I don't know how many times I had to wave her down or yell to get her attention.  She appeared to be ignoring us every time she walked by.  A couple of times she looked at us like we were bothering her.  Not to accuse this place of racism but she was obviously attending to the Korean diners regularly that came in after us, and not once came by to check on us on her own.  She even gave the check to a couple of tables that asked well after I had asked her three times.  We still didn't get it after 20 minutes.  My wife was pissed off as we walked out.  She got a big laugh when I said I left zero for the tip, since she always complains that I always over tip for bad service.  I will not be recommending this place to anyone, especially friends and family.",0
"I have mixed feelings about this place.  I'll say up front: I only ever go there on Sundays for football, and I would never go there for any other reason.  It is the only bar I know of in the city where you can reliably find every NFL game televised and enjoy your Sunday if you're not a Steelers fan.  Pretty much every team is represented by the crowd on Sundays, with a disproportional number of Bills and Redskins fans.  The crowd is generally friendly, with many of the same faces from week to week.\n\nThey tend to have a wide selection of beers that rotates pretty regularly, but wide selection doesn't always mean good selection.  That said, sometimes they get some really great beers that you wouldn't expect to find at a sports bar.  Whatever you do, don't order a bloody Mary, they're atrociously bad.  The staff is almost universally friendly, with the exception of one barback who seems to always be in a bad mood and rude to customers (he often takes over as bartender later in the day on Sundays).  That said, the wait staff don't seem to know much about the food or beers that are offered, often mis-characterizing new beers that are on tap or giving wrong information about things on the menu.\n\nThe food is mediocre and over-priced.  When two of us go for one game on a Sunday, drink 3-4 beers each and each order an entr\u00e9e, we generally end up with a tab in the $80-90 range, depending on what we're drinking that day.  In a city that is almost universally accommodating to vegetarians, this place is most decidedly not.  They have a veggie burger which is actually pretty good, but it's the only decent thing on the menu for a vegetarian to eat (there is also a grilled cheese sandwich and a veggie sandwich, both of which are bland to the point of tasteless.  It's like eating plain bread).  They have 4 entr\u00e9e salads, and every one of them has meat as a defining ingredient.  They don't even have beans so you could have decent veggie nachos.  I know, it's a sports bar, but I don't want to eat the same veggie burger every Sunday for 17 weeks.  It gets old.  Fast.\n\nUpshot?  In the absence of a new sports bar opening up, we'll be back next season, but not before then.",2
"A quaint little suites hotel located off the freeway and next to a vast majority of all chain resteraunts and business'. There is a Shell gas station right next door (over priced gas ) but for convenience is pretty good. \n\nThere is also a Hospital right next door , hopefully on your visit that wont be needed lol. \n\nThe staff here is really friendly\n\nThe breakfast is just cereals , muffins etc could use some improvement but nothing to complain about .\n\nAnd the grounds are well kept and clean.",3
"Great mussels, drinks, and atmosphere. Definitely will need reservations, but the burgers and steaks are worth it.",3

"My two cabinets and couch that are vintage were ruined in storage.  This was made evident when the movers returned my office furniture.  The movers showed me the damage before it was moved from their storage pod.  Then, they offer me $90.00 to settle the matter and had an erroneous contract to try and minimize my claim.  I informed them that the furniture they damaged was vintage and literally irreplaceable.  I will never use them again and considering how I was treated after they made mistake after mistake, would never recommend them to anyone.",0

"Bamboo Nails is the best nail salon in Phoenix! They use high quality product. I have tried several nail salons in the area and have been disappointed. Bamboo Nails charges a few dollars more but totally worth it! Your polish wont chip and peel. Ask for Kim to put on a set of nails! She is amazing and listens to how YOU want the nails to look, not her ideas.",4
I had a groupon for a 50 minute facial.  The lobby is very nice and the lady at the front is very friendly.  My facial was excellent.  The only complaint I would have is that they don't have private rooms.  It is one big room with cubicles divided by sheets.  I could hear others talking and the door into the area constantly opening and closing.  It throws off the relaxation vibe a bit.,3
"My Bbq pulled pork sandwich was yummy.  The other 3 in our party said the burgers were not seasoned, needed salt.",1
"My kids love love love this park. They ask to go to the train park all the time. Inexpensive rides on their railway and carousel make the place affordable, and you can picnic or buy food there. Their shops are reasonably priced with great chances to view their museum side as well. Never mind that the place is a huge park with a few play areas, one with swings and such, the other is like an old west town and the train goes by both. \n\nLong story short... McCormick-Stillman is one of the best parks in the valley.",4
"Spoon is lovely. I've heard of it for a long time but had never got round to going. The decor is lovely- vintage-y without being naff or try hard, as often can be the case. I had a roll with black pudding and egg that was totally spot on and everyone else really enjoyed their breakfast grills- the veggie and normal alike. It had a lovely atmosphere, and although we were all in getting breakfast there was an elegant table near us that we're having fizz. It had a nice buzz and eclectic mix (although potentially this was heightened by the festival atmosphere that pervades the city?)",2
Went here because I heard they had low prices.  Maybe if you just shop their specials but guess I'll continue buying my liquor from Costco.  Employee working the register didn't seem to want to be bothered when I couldn't find what I was looking for.  First and last time going there.,0
Awesome place if you like your hair looking like you are 8 years old. Disappointing.,0
The customer service was lacking.  Other than that I love that it has a Starbucks and you can sip on some coffee while you read a good book,2
Food was good had yellow curry and pad Thai.  Service was good also.  Two entrees and drinks with refills to go all under 20$,3
"My dog and I went here because it was the closest to our house. I got there and I had to park on the side of the road, not safe but it works. So we went inside and it was a decent size for my 8 pound dog. The grass was very brown and it was dull and boring . There was no other dogs there so my dog had no one to play with. Nice concept but we didn't enjoy ourselves.",0
"Prices are fair and the guys do an awesome job of scrubbing your car until it sparkles and shines. The coffee here is really good too. The lady behind the counter was super helpful and she customized my white chocolate toffee coffee until I was completely happy with it. Excellent customer service with a smile. Car washes include a complimentary car freshener clip (cherry, vanilla, new car) and free self service vacuuming. I don't really know what else someone could want. \nOh and bonus points for being environmentally friendly for the car wash and using natural sugars for the drinks (ask about the different flavors of whip cream!).",4
"The atmosphere and location are great, but the ice cream itself is really nothing special. I've had better... from the gorcery store...",1
Right next to my work. Fast and friendly service. Great tasting breakfast. Long line on weekends.,3
"When we moved to North Phoenix from Scottsdale we missed some of the restaraunts that had been close to home. We were told great things about Valle Luna, so we checked it out. \n\nThe one problem I have is that they are packed to the gills during dinner time, from 6pm to 9pm you're going to have at least a 20 minute wait to get a seat. That's if you can find a parking spot in their very small parking lot. We often have to leave the car on the street, which is something we're not comfortable with. \n\nIt's worth the wait. The service is excellent. The food is great. They had a lot to live up to, there are some amazing Mexican Food Restaraunts in Scottsdale, and they managed to hold their own. We always go to Valle Luna when we're in the mood for a sit down Mexican dinner, and will continue to do so as long as they're still there.",3
"I came here with my friends since this place had a pretty decent rating. FOOLED. If you're craving for good Vietnamese food, I suggest to go somewhere else. Soups were slightly warm, and flavorless. Glasses were empty the whole time; the service was very poor. Staffs were kind, and friendly, but the foods were just a huge disappointment.",1
"DISSAPPOINTED!!\nI ordered the TONKOTSU ramen with chyashu pork of course, but they ran out of pork!!! So I supplemented with egg and chicken. \nSoup was thin and flavorless, egg over cooked, chicken bland, the bean sprouts, and spinach was not helpful or wanted!\nI make better instant ramen at home! Having had unforgettable ramen from Japan and very good ramen in Hawaii and irresistable ramen in Vegas even.... I'm sad AZ ramen is embarrassing.",0
"I'm not going to give a 1 star review just because of one employee but, 2 stars is pushing it.  I just wasted close to an hour of my life.  All I wanted was a black Oxford shirt.  This lady had no clue what one was and just kept guessing.  Wild goose chase, I should have walked away from a lot sooner.  Its OK to have no idea what something is, but ask someone.  Or google it, or just quit being a weirdo.  What a waste of time.  Will go to Macy's or Dillard's first next time.",1
"My food was flavorful.... that is about the nicest thing I can say about this establishment.  Once I was seated it was like I no longer existed, thank god I got there early and didn't have to wait in the line that gathered when I left.  \n\nThe menu sucks and the staff is clueless... maybe it is just French Cusine but there was nothing normal to order for breakfast.  I chose the Stake and pouched Egg Sandwich (how to eat pouched eggs in a sandwich without a knife and fork is beyond me). It took at least 30 minutes and was cold when it arrived at my table.  The manager was called to the table next to me and seemed pretty occupied wtih them so I didn't bother expressing my displeasure..\n\nIn total my bill was $30 for one person for breakfast.  Maybe if I was paying by the minute I could understand.  \n\nDon't waste your time at Le Cafe Ile! Heck the buffet is cheaper.",0
No good. Nothing to say. Bland or too salty. No taste beyond that. I would only recommend this place if you are extrememly broke and only for midnight to 7am ($2.95).,0
Went there for our anniversary on a wednesday night. We had a registration and had to wait a dew minutes to be seated. We had the prime rib south point cut. It was very good. Perfect size. Cooked wonderfully. Just how I like it. \nThe bread they brought before the dinner was wonderful! Crispy on the outside and soft on the inside. The house salad was ok. Nothing to rave about. We had cheesecake for dessert which was good also. The prices are reasonable. The atmosphere is dimly lit but not too dark and it wasn't too crowded so they were separating the diners a bit with a table between most parties.,3
"We came here last night for a work happy hour. The view of the lake is absolutely beautiful and the atmosphere is great. They have a huge bar with a good selection of draft beers, scotch, and mixed drinks. The staff is very friendly and helpful. My one complaint is that the appetizers need some work. We had the nachos which was very plain. We also had queso dip which after one minute on the table turned rock hard since it was just regular cheese just melted. We tried their chicken skewers which were pretty good. I can't comment on their main course dishes because I've only had apps but I've heard they are great. Overall I really like this place and will be returning!",3
"On this last trip to Vegas me and my gf decided that we wanted to get away from the buffets a little bit and look for some of those places that the locals recommend. After doing a little research on Yelp of course, we decided on the Maple Tree for our first morning there. We arrived in Vegas just a little bit past noon on a sunday, which ended up being a real good thing since we avoided the huge breakfast rush. Even then, we ended up waiting at least 20-25 mins for a table, which was not to my liking since it was only 2 of us. But being that it was a sunday and we had just arrived in Vegas, I didn't let it bother me much. We started off our wait standing outside because the little \""lobby\"" is as tiny as you can get, sitting about 4-5 people maybe, the restaurant isn't very big in itself so it doesn't help the rate at which you get a table. After about 15 minutes of waiting the seats in the waiting area opened up so my gf and I went in there to sit down, big mistake. The area was so hot and muggy with the sun hitting it directly and no ventilation, we were about to step back out and keep waiting outside but they called us up right at that time so take us to our table. Inside the restaurant the temp wasn't so much better, we actually requested to be changed to a table underneath one of the ceiling fans, which helped. I don't know if the AC wasn't working or if they chose not to have it on now that we are out of the summer time, but I definitely can't imagine being in there during a hot Vegas summer under those conditions. \nAnyway, so we finally got to our table and ordered our drinks. As we looked around we noticed the homey, country kitchen vibe that others describe. Again, the restaurant is not very big, it is located in a small strip mall, so you end up pretty close to your table neighbors. After asking for recommendations from the waitress, I ordered the country fried steak and home style potatoes, my gf went with the Cinnamon raisin french toast. And after all the waiting the first time I tasted my food, I completely forgot about the couple of not-so good things. My steak was real new york strip steak, not that fake frozen cube steak they use at most places. The gravy tastes absolutely amazing, not canned, which is common. And the potatoes??? Great!!! I don't even like onions, yet they tasted so good in these. My gf really liked her food as well, she said the french toast looked and tasted like it had actually been prepared from scratch. \n\nAs far as the staff, they were all really helpful and courteous. WE actually even got night club recommendations from our waitress. We loved this place so much we both agreed that it is now a must on any future visits to Vegas. If you love good home cooking, you must try this place too, but you probably shouldn't go here if you're in a hurry. You might wait a little bit but I think once you try the food you'll forget about that.",3
"Probably the worst buffet I've eaten at in Vegas. Lots of options, but none of them very appealing. Desserts looked nicer than they tasted (I think the best things were the key lime tartlets and the strawberry shortcake - everything else I tried wasn't worth the calories). Saving grace was the crab legs (weekends only?) but if I'd known all I would eat was crab I would have forked over extra for the Rio seafood buffet.\n\nThey get two stars instead of one because the staff was so nice - our waitress was really on top of things despite the fact that she was the only one servicing the entire room. Kitchen staff seemed kind and observant too - I burned myself picking up a serving spoon and they noticed and immediately came over to replace the utensil (and position it correctly so it didn't get too hot). \n\nShould have checked Yelp before we decided to eat here : p",1
"On an early Saturday evening the restaurant wasn't crowded but as time went by the noise level increased a few decibels as families with children started to arrive.  We had asked to be seated close to the door in view of the big screen TV showing the Olympics but the ambient noise level became barely  tolerable as the kids behind us squirmed to be seated.  The good news was Sam Adams on tap plus finally, a restaurant with lettuce wraps appetizers with more than enough lettuce to cover the minced chicken, Shitake mushrooms, water chestnuts and green onions in a soy ginger sauce.  Most of the time more lettuce is needed and one has to wait for more.  In terms of lettuce wraps, PF Changs does a better job but as I say there was more than enough lettuce.\n\nNormally, we order one of the thin and crispy Neapolitan pizzas such as the classic Margherita but this time broke ranks for the \""new\"" pizza called Pear & Gorgonzola.  The ingredients (caramelized pears, Gorgonzola, Fontina and Mozzarella cheeses, caramelized sweet onions and chopped hazelnuts) sounded different and inviting.  Indeed it was different from the usual fare and quite a mixture of tastes with some crunch and caramelization flavors.  It was somewhat of a surprise to have it topped with field greens tossed in a house Gorgonzola ranch dressing.  Thumbs up for the pizza and neutral to negative for the field greens topping.  If there had been a choice of toppings another would have been ordered.\n\nNext time I would request a quieter portion of the restaurant away from the front door.",2
"The food is very good and the view is spectacular.  The \""hospitality\"" is grossly lacking and because of this I cannot recommend this restaurant.  When you pay a certain amount for a meal (there is a \""$50/person minimum, $15 split plate charge\"" for example) you should be able to expect a certain level of service.  Not so for \""Top of the World\"" - I was very disappointed.\n\nPeople were ridiculously rude at the security checkpoint, as if we were burdening them for being there (seriously?!  This guy's ONE job is to lead people through a metal detector and show them the elevator.  It's hardly taxing, dude.  Get another job if you don't like this one.)\n\nOur waiter was outrageously rude about the restaurant.com gift certificate we had.  We sat down and he was fine.  We tell him about the GC and his demeanor changed (to attitude and rudeness) IMMEDIATELY.  No joke.  He actually didn't even want to let us use it because we didn't have it printed out, even though the website specifically stated we didn't need a printout, just the code (we even showed him a screenshot of this exact wording on the site, since we were concerned about not having a printout either, but wanted to take the site's word).  He made a loud scene and called his manager over while telling us \""he's not going to accept it\"" either - unbelievable!\n\nThe manager graciously just took the code down and said it was fine, slipped away, and then unfortunately left us again with our charming server.  I got the feeling he was used to dealing with our guy's \""personality\"".\n\nAfter this debacle, the meal went on.  But instead of splurging as we had intended though (this was supposed to be a nice family dinner with my husband, mom, and brother), we basically stuck to the order minimum, since we really did not feel like patronizing this place.  No overpriced champagne for us!  \n\nAs I said, the view is gorgeous, and the food was good.  All tall rotating restaurants are overpriced for the food and drink, but you're paying for that view, of course.  If we hadn't had such atrocious \""service\"" I'd maybe recommend this place (as long as you remember what kind of restaurant it is and how that affects the prices); but the Stratosphere is getting run down (walking through the casino and shopping area was pretty deserted and almost creepy feeling), and the whole experience being as it was, I'll have to say you can spend your money at many, many other fine establishments and have a MUCH nicer experience while in Vegas.",1
"Not bad. Quite a bit better than Stir Fry Paradise down the street. The meat was well cooked, vegetables were fresh, and there was a good variety.\n\nHowever, there are some annoyances. The day we went, the waitress was aggressively pushing the deserts. We had just been shown the table when the desert crap started. Seriously? I haven't even sat down. \n\nI also have a practical complaint. When you get to the sauce area, the damn sneeze guard makes you have to contort a bit in order to get at the sauces in the back. Super annoying, Admittedly, if the sauces I liked weren't in the back, I probably wouldn't care.",2
"Die Franchise-Kette Purino ist nun auch in Karlsruhe am Gottesauer Schlo\u00df vertreten. Bereits zwei Mal konnte ich das Essen testen. Einmal hatte ich eine Pizza (Amici), heute dann die Nudeln (Fussili Arrabiata).\nBeides Mal kann ich die guten Bewertungen hier nicht nachvollziehen. Die Pizza schmeckt langweilig, fad und der Teig ist an den R\u00e4ndern so kross, da\u00df die Teigsplitter beim Gabelansetzen \u00fcber den Tisch fliegen. Die Nudeln habe ich heute sogar zur\u00fcckgehen lassen, weil sie wirklich nach gar nichts (!) geschmeckt haben. Es war wie Nudeln ohne alles, nur ein bi\u00dfchen rot eingef\u00e4rbt. Ich habe mir dann mit einem Kollegen dessen Pizza geteilt und da wurde \u00fcbrigens mein Eindruck von meinem ersten Besuch best\u00e4tigt; wieder langweilig und ohne besonderen Geschmack.\n\nKlar erwarte ich bei so einem System-Restaurant keine kulinarischen Hochleistungen, aber das war wirklich nichts. \n\nZus\u00e4tzlich negativ aufgefallen ist, da\u00df fast alle Messer und Gabeln, wenn nicht schmutzig, zumindestens unsch\u00f6ne Sp\u00fclspuren hatten. Kurz mal das Besteck anschauen, bevor man es in die kleinen Holzkistchen am Tischrand legt, w\u00fcrde sicherlich nicht schaden.\n\nEinen Stern gibt's f\u00fcr die nette Location und das Ambiente, den zweiten f\u00fcr den netten, freundlichen und verst\u00e4ndnisvollen Service. Meine Nudeln wurden ohne Murren zur\u00fcckgenommen und storniert und nach unseren Kritik\u00e4u\u00dferungen gab's dann noch einen Espresso (die Bedienung meinte EXpresso) gratis.",1
I can't believe that guy that complained about the prices going up. He's lucky to get ammo at any price the way things are going! He must live in a cave. I've been buying from UN Ammo for about a year - mostly online and once in person (during their grand opening). I read about them at www.blogspot.randomammo.com . The prices were the lowest I could find. It was nice meeting them and all but it's their low prices that keep me as a customer.,3
"I've been to a few sushi places in Las Vegas, but this restaurant has got to be on my top for it's selection and taste. I really enjoy the variety of sushi they give you for all-you-can-eat especially for the Nigiri which is my favorite and the only thing I ever order there. Their rolls are delicious too and sometimes overwhelming when it comes to the amount they give you, but overall still delicious.",3
"Disappointing. I had high expectations from the reviews and appearance.  Lack of variety and originality.  Great if you like marsala sauce, pre-fab foodservice generics and breaded everything.  The red sauce/marinara was the only thing I could say something good about, but I'd bet it too came out of a can or jar.  Definately NOT worth the money and I hope to never go back.",1
"Subway is the place to go to if you have no idea what to eat. They have a wide variety choices to choose from: whether you want breakfast, lunch, or dinner they have different combos to fit your needs. Their location is great and very easy to spot while you're driving. Staff was friendly and welcoming. I am definitely going to be back here much more often.",3
"I was not impressed at all with this place. To be completely honest, I went to Robertos right after to get more food. To start the meal was overpriced. The portion size was much smaller than Cafe Rio or Roberto's and the quality was not even close. The pork was dry and the tortillas were not very good. They also did not have dessert when I was there. Why have it on the menu? Just a tease! I will not be returning!",1
"Always wanted to stop here, finally did after 6 years, could have waited 6 more.  I was disappointed. Not as good as I was hoping for.  I think it was close to $12 for a pretty small Cheese Steak.  I will bedriving by next time.",1
"Most of the employees here are quick, friendly, and efficient! But this Circle K is TOO SMALL for the location it's in! Four gas pumps in a tiny lot right next to the freeway?? CMON!! And there are one or two employees that are... slower/older.. and somehow they manage to get scheduled during some pretty busy hours, resulting in a line all the way to the back of the store. I love the convenience of the location, but most days I'll drive right by this one to hit the one right up the road!",1
"Good food, reasonably priced and friendly service.  Nothing mind blowing, but solid, and I'll definitely be back.  Had the crabby benedict side of bacon and a $3  bloody.  I want to come back and try the Kahlua french toast.\n\nParking is easy with a good size lot and room enough inside for small group brunch.",3
"Being half Asian myself (Filipino), I of course love Asian cuisine. In my almost 50 years of life, I have had mixed experiences when it comes to Vietnamese cuisine. However, and thankfully, Vietnam Grill was definitely a PLUS! From the outside, it looks kind of ordinary. But don't judge this book by its cover! The inside is much nicer than the exterior suggests, and the food is the star here.\n\nTo start, we had the Cha Gio (Crispy Spring Rolls). Now one thing to keep in mind about Vietnamese is that they are meat eaters.....more so than other Asian cultures (with the exception of Koreans who love meat as much). These spring rolls reminded me of my Mom's rolls, who stuffed them with plenty of meat. This one was loaded with pork, onions and mushrooms. And were they ever yummy, especially with the Asian fish sauce (which we called Patis). \n\nFor dinner, my wife had the crispy pan fried noodles with beef, and GOD were those ever delicious! They loaded it up with beef and a wonderful brown sauce which were soaked up the crunchy noodles. They they topped it with lots of fresh Cilantro, and what a flavor rush!\n\nI had the Traditional Vietnamese Hot and Spicy Curry with Chicken. This too was good, but not nearly as good as what my wife had. Not sure about the \""hot\"" part of this dish as I didn't think it was hot at all. In fact, I wouldn't even qualify it as \""spicy\"" let alone hot. Still it was tasty.\n\nIt seemed like everyone around us was enjoying Pho. So next time, it's the flank steak and briskett Pho!\n\nOverall an excellent meal and I can't wait to try their Pho!",4
"My husband and I stopped here after a long day of house shopping. I ordered the fall/winter special \""Jack Frost Latte\"", my husband ordered the \""Tuxedo\"". I really enjoyed mine. I am always a little leery when trying a new local coffee shop, most of the time they are excellent, but every once in a while they are terrible....Beans and Cream was not one of those. I have since been back three times in the last three weeks. I \""work from home\"" a lot, which means I work from a coffee shop as to not eat all day and watch T.V. This has been my place. All three times the coffee drinks were great. Prepared well, the coffee smooth. \n\nI have eaten lunch here as well. That also did not disappoint. I ordered the quiche, my husband ordered the pulled pork sandwich. I liked mine, it was good, but his was better. More filling (thats what I get for ordering quiche). \n\nOther fun perks of B and C: \n - You can get local ice cream there\n - You can buy local craft/art items from local artists in the area \n - There are fresh flowers on the table from a florist down the street\n - children's play area \n - you can purchase out of the ordinary seeds there \n\nIf you come to visit me I will probably take you here.",3
Really awesome ribs!!! Fresh made and high quality! The place is a hole in the wall but the owner brings the food out to you! Bacon cheese fries will make you fantasize about them. ... I only gave 4 stars because Sundays are a crap shoot as to what items are available... But at least you know it's all fresh!!!,3
"Sorry, I'll side with the other poor reviews and agree that this isn't the best establishment in Pittsburgh. I went here with a mission: to buy a new HDTV. The parking, staff, and product selection were all average; however, the tv that I bought didn't even work when I took it back home. The supposedly \""smart\"" tv (Hisense 32 inch) couldn't pick up the wireless signal in my apartment, plus the quality of the picture was awful. There was no color! Thus, I immediately took the product back, hit myself for trying to go cheap, and took my ass to Best Buy instead. I wouldn't recommend buying a higher-end electronic here.",1
"Although the selection was limited (no uni in January, the height of uni season?), the fish that they had was very good.  The tako salad was actually borderline awesome.  A decent Az sushi joint!  I'll definitely be back.",2
"Nice property close to the strip and shopping.  The rooms are modern and trendy, comfortable... and the rooms from the higher floors have a nice view of the strip.  The staff is friendly and attentive.",3
"So, at first glance, I thought this place was more of an upscale burger joint... Part of that is true. It's more like a Hooter's where you can get an upscale-tasting burger. Which is also, okay by me. I had the Italian, which was pretty tasty, and the waffle fries were delicious. Our table also shared an Eiffel tower of beer, that I really wish I would have taken a picture of. There's a cylinder of ice in the tower that keeps the beer cold, and a tap at the base for easy pouring. All in all, a pretty decent experience, a pretty tasty burger.",2
Worse customer service at auto center. Don't online order. They don't have a clue what they're doing here. Will take long.,0
"First time going here. Pull up to the attendant, he shakes his head at me complains that my car is covered in bugs (of course it is I just got back from a roadtrip - thats why I took it here) and gave me bad attitude. He charged me an extra 3 bucks for bug removal, Ive never heard of that before... Not a big deal, wait for my car to get washed, everything looked fine, except a letter from my car tag is missing that definitely wasn't missing before. I waited thirty extra min for them to fish it out of the gutters and all the manager does it stick it back on my car with tape... What a joke. I threw a fit, and he didnt offer me anything or even apologize and was a major a-hole. He told me to stop bothering him. You couldnt pay me to go back here.\n\nUpdate: You can ignore the response from management on here, I contacted him and got no response.",0
"Not a fan.  Service is horrible usually on Saturday nights, which is when I'm usually dragged in there.  I've ordered food every time, and I'm not a picky eater by any means, but the only thing I can say I've not been disappointed in is the fries?  I am not a smoker, so this place automatically assaults me as soon as I walk it, but hey, it's a bar so it's expected I guess!!  The only reason I ever go back is because there are others in my group of friends who think the fried fish is good but I've not been impressed.  I even ordered a grilled cheese once, and it was COLD in the middle and the cheese wasn't melted....who screws up GRILLED CHEESE?  At least the fries where hot this time!  A friend had a French Dip sandwich recently that looked fairly decent, but she said the meat was \""dry\"" and she really needed the au jus to make it palatable.  If you're looking for a smoky dive bar to drink and oggle others, this place is fairly well lit so you'd probably enjoy it.  Just don't expect great service if you're ordering food, and don't expect the food to be good either!  I'm going back again I'm sure, and will be trying the pizza since that's what other Yelpers seem to recommend.",1
"Maybe I'm being a little too harsh because the first time I stayed in Venetian, and that was a godly awesome hotel. This one isn't bad, but...I definitely enjoyed Venetian more (and I believe this place was only $50 less or so).\n\nI liked this hotel in terms of accessibility. Compared to Venetian, this is the heart of The Strip. Since we depended on public transit, we wanted a hotel close to the express stops, and this was one of them. This hotel is also close to the airport express route, so I didn't need to transfer at South Strip (or take one of those unreliable hotel shuttles). I also liked the whole \""New York\"" feel, but I only really felt it in the main floor, with the whole Little Italy/Greenwich Village feel.\n\nThe rooms, for the price we paid, were decent at best. I can't complain much considering the beds were very comfy and everything went relatively smoothly in terms of checking in and out, and they even offer complimentary computer access for boarding pass printings! However the rooms were only about 40% the size of the Venetian rooms, and for $50 less I somewhat rather pay a bit more for a larger hotel.\n\nThe wifi was also quite weak sometimes. Without the ethernet plug, the speed felt like dialup at most times.\n\nhotels.com is your friend when searching for Vegas hotels. Honestly most are the same, but this hotel is good for what its worth.",2
"Mucho gusto es much malo, mucho dinero por much nada.\nOur order: 2 fish tacos, comes with salad $14.\n2 chicken tacos, comes with salad $12.\nA second round of chips is an extra dollar.\nThe food was ok, but at those prices should have been spectacular or at least filling.\nIf only if is was possible to review somewhere and give them no stars.\nMucho Gusto would be it.",0
"I was actually a little let down after my first time of trying Jersey Mike's because I was expecting something amazing from all the positive things I have heard about it. \n\nMy opinion was that it was slightly better than Subway, but there are several other sandwich places I would rather go to. I ordered an Italian sandwich, and it was good but quite standard. I was not impressed with the prices and found them to be a little much, so its not likely that this place will be a regular stop for me.",2
I'm not a popcorn person but this is really good.,3
"What a shame to see these Souper Salad restaurants closing one by one, starving themselves out of business by charging $2 less than they should for their excellent buffet meals!  Not long ago I was enjoying eating at 11 of them around the Valley, & now we're down to only 4, as of this moment!\n\nOk, so today I enjoyed another lunch at this nice round Souper Salad nee Van de Kamp's at Metro Center.  Yeah, they were busy!  Maybe my favorite here of the remaining locations will survive.  \n\nThe food selections vary some from day to day, so mostly I'd just like to compare this SS to it's main competitor, Sweet Tomatoes, which you can see out the window from here.  Over here the salad is better, the soup, chili, & cottage cheese are much better, the pizza is better than the caca bread... ur, I mean focaccia bread over there, the real soft ice cream is better than the frozen yogurt over there, & I paid $5.49 here today with the reusable coupon from their Website...  $3.30 less than the price over there the other day when Scott W. & I went!  \""That's the Way It Is\"", as C\u00e9line Dion would say (& she's delicious too!).     :-))",3
"I got like a spicy chicken sandwich and fries.  The fries were actually very well seasoned and delicious.  The burger was great except for some parts of the chicken that was a little bland.  The prices were reasonable and most of the customers in my party were satisfied.  This is my first experience dining in Arizona, so I don't have much of a comparison, so I will give it an average rating.",2
"I had seen Dr. Saud at his older office a couple of years ago. When I needed more testing done I found that he had moved locations to horizon view medical center. While getting someone to pick up the phones has been difficult,  they squeezed me into the schedule right away, and got me set up for the procedure I need. Dr. Saud and his staff treated me Like a priority and i truly appreciate that. Would recommend him to anyone.",4
"Service was friendly but REALLY slow, as always.  We came 4 their Valentine's special but they ran out of bottles of Chardonnay.  Wat kind of bar manager lets his bar run out of Chardonnay on Valentines Day?",0
"Hands down the best service in town!\n\nWe were regulars here for a long time (only stopped coming after moving far away). The staff is amazing and the subs are fresh and delicious. We usually get the veggie.  Their bread is lovely and the veggie's great, especially with lots of red wine vinegar. \n\nLove this place!!",3
"I've stayed at the Hard Rock on several occasions for work. This last trip reminded why I despise it. \n\nIt's not a terrible hotel, especially for a hotel that was originally conceived as a concert venue with some rooms, rather than a full-fledged resort. I've only stayed in the Paradise tower, where the rooms are nice, but nothing special. The overall decor theme (which was originally leopard print and purple) of grays and reds just feels dingy and dirty. I get that they're trying to channel a nightclub/rock lounge feel, but it gets old rather quickly. \n\nI find much of the clientele to be classless. The young, party-seeking crowd that the hotel and several of its venues (Rehab, Body English) attract seem to care less about little things like manners, decorum, and hygiene. Should you think that I'm an old fart with a bias against 20-somethings (Full disclosure: I'm 39), let me assure you that I'd be equally annoyed by bands of 50-year olds walking through the hallways shouting obscenities, starting drunken brawls and doing things like leaving a 40-foot trail of puke in their wake because they chose to vomit and walk and vomit and walk rather than stay outside and hurl in the bushes. \n\nWhich leads me to the cleaning staff. While there are a few a exceptions, I find the crew at the Hard Rock to completely inept. Whether this is due to poor training, understaffing or horrible management, I cannot tell. \n\nExhibit A: The aforementioned 40-foot trail of vomit took nearly an hour to be cleaned up. That was after the twenty minutes it took for a staff person to say, \""we should probably get this cleaned up.\""\n\nExhibit B: I stopped by my room at lunchtime on a Sunday, and noticed a discarded room service plate of chicken wings that my next-door neighbor had placed outside their door. They had obviously been in quite a rush, because wings were strewn across the hallway in front of their door. When I went to bed that night...the plate was still there. When I got up the next morning...it was STILL there. The last sighting was sometime after 10am Monday, probably an hour or so after some staff person saw it and thought, \""we should probably get this cleaned up.\""\n\nExhibit C: My room got passed over for cleaning one day. When I called down for service, three maids appeared to service the room (well done!). They made the bed, refreshed the towels...and then left the room with all of the trash and dirty glasses untouched. Oh well. One coworker performed an experiment by leaving her Do Not Disturb sign on the floor a few feet inside her room. It stayed there for 4 days. \n\nThe Hard Rock does have a few redeeming qualities: Culinary Dropout and 35 Steaks, comfortable beds, and bars that serve well-poured drinks for decent prices. The convention staff was helpful and fun to work with work. And Pilot, the super-helpful security guy that went out if his way to make my friends feel welcome and cared for on a handful of occasions.\n\nI will probably end up staying at the hotel again for work, but I definitely won't choose it for a personal stay -- that is, until new management comes in and decides, \""we should probably get this cleaned up.\""",1
"As mentioned repeatedly by other reviewers, the Benedum (which is apparently the 3rd largest theater in the country, according to a fellow fan) is an absolutely beautiful theater. \n\nHowever, I can't honestly say this is my favorite theater, and my opinion has been emphasized after seeing \""Les Mis\u00e9rables\"" last night at this place. I think the Benedum's greatest strength and weakness is indeed its size and scale. It can hold a massive number of people (there's almost 2,200 seats, again according to a fellow fan and reviewer), but as a result, a number of the seats are just, well, bad - in terms of viewing abilities AND actually being able to hear and understand what's happening in the show. Additionally, while it's stunning to look at when the light's are on, during a show, it feels like a very impersonal theater, I think. This admittedly may not matter to some people (and may not even make sense, I know), but for me as a regular theater-goer, bigger truly is not better, and this place is no exception to my rule.\n\nAlso, I try to avoid the second tier at all costs - one, because the seating area shrinks and taller folk in particular find that their knees don't want to work at the end of a show (as some of my friends remembered last night); and two, because, as I touched on earlier, the sound is truly awful in the back. This weekend was the third or fourth show where I've noticed that the acoustics are just plain distracting and downright bad in the back, and while it doesn't always matter when I want a relatively cheap ticket to a show I've seen repeatedly (i.e. I know the lyrics already), it will absolutely ruin a newcomer's experience. For example: once, a friend could not follow \""Jekyll and Hyde\"" due to the bad sound in the back. For me, the poor sound absolutely ruined \""Jesus Christ Superstar.\"" To this day I can't quote a single lyric from that show, because I didn't understand a single word of it during my experience.\n\nJust avoid the back at all cost. Cheaper it may be, but you will have wasted your money completely if you can't enjoy your show.\n\nUltimately, and naturally, the deciding factor for attending the Benedum is whether or not you truly want to see the show there. I consider their runs and shows hit-or-miss, but for the most part, my favorite shows (from \""Wicked\"" to \""Rent\"" to \""Spamalot\"") have gone off without a hitch here.\n\nOn a final note: I can't comment on the small cash bar and snacks that are in the lobby during shows, because I never have the money to purchase these things - but, if you want to splurge, give them a go and let me know what you think!",2
"I love, love, love this place.  I switched from a previous office where the place always seemed to be a three ring circus.  Working together with Dr Oclair and Kate Montgomery, feels like a team.  This place is a well oiled machine!  My most recent visit with Kate Montgomery was to go over some maintenance medication concerns over health conditions she had more familariaty with, and the fact that I wanted to change, and what our next steps were.  We agreed on a change, but would do it by making sure we had the information needed to make sure the proposed choice was a good one with some additional blood tests.  She knew about the medication I wanted to switch to and provided me with well rounded information.  Unlike previous practices, this office is not change adverse, and after I explained why I wanted to change, felt we were on the same page.  This is easier said then done with most practices.  The office is a bit of a drive for me in the mornings 45 minutes which is longer than I like, but with the service received, it is so worth it.  Also unlike my previous provider, when receiving maintenance medications they provide at least 1 or 2 refills that way I'm not there additional times just to collect additional co-pays.  I feel like an empowered patient, Thanks Dr Oclair and Kate Montgomery.",4
"Made it over here for dinner this past weekend and actually got in without a reservation on a Saturday night with only a 15-17 minute wait, which was not bad and gave us a good chance to check out the bar.  Nice beer selection, though they were out of a couple things- not good for a busy weekend.\n\nI like the space- 2 dining rooms, the larger in the back, the bar in the front.  Large B&W photos of Charlotte on the walls.  Decor is neutral and modern without being overly loud.\n\nDespite the mixed review preceding mine, I was quite impressed with the quality.  Appetizer of Hummus and pimento cheese was delicious, though we had to ask for extra pita.   Both spreads were very creamy and tasted nice- that's saying something for a guy who usually rejects pimento cheese outright.\n\nMy dinner party shared a couple salads- a Caesar with real anchovy on top- nice and creamy, but pretty standard.  The better choice was the Roadside salad- mixed greens with red and golden beet slices and goat cheese.  Such a cool mix of flavors, I could've made dinner on a couple of these.  Probably seasonal, but it was a highlight for me.\n\nFor dinner we had the Steak medallions with eggs. Who'd have thought Hollandaise sauce of steak medallions with eggs \""cooked in a basket\"" could be so yummy?  Also had the special \""chicken pot pie\"" with some of the richest sauce ever- it was sherry-based and very filling.  Just a few bites were enough there.\n\nWe also had a couple sides, fries in white truffle oil- crispy, but the truffle taste was lost on me, couldn't find it and this was a definite let down.  Mac and cheese was good, though- homemade with real cheeses and a nice crusty top.\n\nDessert menu was brief, to say the least- shared a pecan pie that was nothing spectacular.  This portion of the meal underwhelmed- both in selection (maybe 3 options???) and execution.  \n\nOverall I found service to be responsive and conscientious- they made sure to stop by when meal took a little longer due to a large rush of tickets.  The place was pretty busy all night, so I think word has caught on that MOFO has another young hit on their hands.\n\nFoodie friends, this place is worth a checkout.  Disregard the roadside grill name, 15 North is looking to cater to a higher level of culinary expertise.  For the most part, I think they've got it.  Just count of doing dessert elsewhere!",2
"I went to this place a few times and my last experience was horrible.  The girl who was doing my fill was sick, wearing a mask and constantly coughing.  She stopped after about 10 minutes into my fill and asked if I would mind if she took a 30  minute break to eat and for me to wait until she finished.  I said that I would mind so she continued.  Then she began again and then stopped and started staring outside the windows like a deer in the headlights.  The husband and wife owners began speaking firmly with her, in their own language of course, and she seemed to snap out of it for a while.  I wanted to get someone else to finish my nails, but of course, they were too busy to help me.  I was there over 2 hours for a fill.  RIDICULOUS!  I do NOT recommend this place at all.  I don't believe they clean as some of the customers may think.  If they did, why would they allow this person wait on customers.  She must be a family member or something.  NEVER AGAIN!",0
"My new favorite coffee shop!  I love the feeling you get when you walk in here...like to should plan to stay for a few hours and relax while having a fancy coffee/tea, and the pastries they have are delicious! Great prices. Just watching them make the drinks feels like an adventure...I love it!  The design in my coffee made me smile :)  Well worth going!",4
"Great location, looks good from the outside but is a bit dated inside and could use renovations. They charge you an extra $15 a night which covers Internet but they don't even have wireless. Also both my wife and I ended up with bug bites so I'm thinking bed bugs and on checking out I told the front desk and they said they would check it out and call me. They did call later and naturally they said it was clean.. So who knows maybe we got bitten some other place but sure seems suspect.",1
"My cousin's usual \""hole in the wall\"" Mexican  restaurant does not serve beer, so we decided to try Nando's because it was close  and we wanted beer after a 6 hr drive back from LA.  Lucky we were not in a hurry because the service was slow considering the restaurant was not busy. We had to ask twice for our beer and three times for additional salsa!\n\nFortunately the food was better than the service. I had Alfredo's Green Chile Pork.  The Hatch green chile sauce was great. However, the whole beans were a bit \""crunchy\"" for my liking. \n\nNext time I'm in town I'll go to the \""hole in the wall\"" and have a Coke.",1
"overpriced as should be expected - had oatmeal which was ok at best and i guess its not fair to judge a place when i only get oatmeal, but the service was slllloooooooow.  coffee however was very very good",1
"JUST OK. Sometimes its hard to explain exactly why something works for you and why other things don't. The atmosphere was pleasant and decorated as expected. The staff was friendly and service attentive. The food came quickly but we never felt rushed. As I'm writing this I'm struggling to use descriptive words ... summing up the overall experience, rather non-descript. If you're in the Mile End area and looking for a change from Quebecois cuisine then this will work well but I wouldn't recommend making a tremendous effort.",2
"The thing with PT's is that they're all pretty much the same. They don't deviate too much from the standard formula of drinks, food, smoky environment, and mostly-blonde lady-bartenders. \n\nThis one actually doesn't serve food, which really sucks. I like getting chicken wings with my beers, but these guys send you to the Roberto's next door to get food. That kinda sucks bc Roberto's doesn't equal wings/burgers/bar food. \n\nThe drinks here are ok, though nothing to get excited about. \n\nI'll prob return here, but mostly bc it's close to people's houses.",2
"AMC Theaters has the distinct disadvantage in Phoenix at operating in a town with a high-quality, local provider of entertainment (Harkins) and they really pale in comparison. Tonight we went to the AMC 24 at Arizona Center, which is literally right near our house, but we've been there only two or three times in as many years. Why? Because AMC doesn't offer a senior discount any longer.\n\nFor AMC Management -- Did you know that there is a huge population of older people living in condos in the downtown Phoenix location who go to moves three and four times a week? I think it is absolutely ridiculous that I could go to a Harkins and see a movie for $12-13 for two but when it's an AMC Theater, it's $20. Do they think they are so special that they warrant this extra \""tax\""?\n\nThe theater is generally clean and nice, but the prices on sodas and popcorn are too high, combined with the fact that they don't offer the discount to seniors. AMC, please just fold up your tent and go away. We don't need you here.",0
"Ah-soooo  this place is not as good as I was expecting.  I went for sushi and was not impressed.  I went twice hoping I was there on an off day.  I sat at the (liquor) bar and ordered.  I have had better sushi from a grocery store.  The fish was \""fishy\"" and dry.  I ordered one of their speciality rolls and they didn't have the fish and replaced it with a cheaper variety and still charged full price for the roll.  Not cool... It is an ok place to grab a drink with friends but there are better places for sushi. I wouldn't be a good judge for the rest of the place as I have not experienced the rest of the menu.",1
"I've never actually been to the store (I feel like I would need to go in at least once in order to give 5 stars, if that makes sense), but used them to move and store my piano for quite some time while I personally moved around the country and got settled into a more permanent home.\n\nTad was always very helpful, and answered all my questions in a knowledgable manner. He was able to advise whether it made sense to move a piano or sell it via consignment through them. He also gave several recommendations for movers since they don't take pianos cross country.\n\nI'm currently making arrangements to get the piano to me now, a move down to Texas. Depending on how everything works out, I will update at some future time (no news is good news). I don't expect a piano that has been in storage for several years to be in tune, but I'm hoping the condition is still good.\n\nUPDATE (August 2014)\nThe piano arrived in very good condition, apart from a little dust and some cobwebs inside (I think they are just covered in blankets in the storage area? not sure). I used Keyboard Carriage for the long distance part of the move, and a local mover in Texas to bring it to my house. Lots of phone calls paid off.",3
"I saw the Rhumbar listed as a must-visit prior to our most recent trip to Vegas and put it on the list to check out. We decided to pop in on a Saturday around 1 and it was empty. The patio was open and complete with heat lamps and televisions, which was perfect for Dec 27th.\n\nThe inside is lovely and complete with bar seats and benches up against the wall. The patio is definitely my favorite and we loved the furniture. It is also perfect for people watching as everyone funnels in to the casino right past it, though the seating area was very quiet. There are misters in the umbrellas and so we will definitely be back in the warmer months!!\n\nDrink wise, I picked a lime caipirinha and my husband went with the latin manhattan after a recommendation from our server. Drinks were brought out quickly and our server was very friendly and helpful with suggestions. We decided we were just going to have one drink and so our bill was brought right out and we were left to enjoy our time. We weren't rushed at all and so we were able to enjoy and sip slowly.\n\nWe will definitely be back on future visits as this is quite a fun spot!",4

"Save yourself a trip! Management was very rude to us after my 5 year old son got severly ill from their chicken dish, apparently the waitress could not tell us what was in the sauce and we had to run out of the restaurant and was severely ill all weekend from the food they served. I will not go back to this restaurant and do not recommend.",0
"I went through the drivethrough at about 10PM and got two tacos. (1.99 each) they were good, hot and fast. Its the kind of place I would hit up when you have a severe case of the munchies or have a late night at the bar. I cannot comment on the dinning room service or the food during the day but it was good enought to warrant a day time visit for sure.",2
"This place ROCKS! Located at the Palazzo, the place meets Vegas expectations- EXTREME.  The decor was fancy, the waitresses/hostess- HOT. Here is what i ordered:\n\nMiso Encrusted Sea-bass robata; Duck robata; Hamachi jalapeno and lemon grass; Tuna Tataki; Hamachi ceviche\n\n     Of Everything, the Sea-bass was THE BEST- Hands down. Probably the best I've ever had.  The waiter happened to recommend the sea-bass over the scallops for taste & portion size. Good call on his part, showing me that the staff is educated and willing to make suggestions.  The Hamachi and lemon grass was great.  Tuna Tataki- was OK, not great, not bad, The Hamachi Ceviche was tasty as well. \n     Friends suggested the Peruvian Plate- enough for two, but i was too interested in the menu selection to choose otherwise. He DID goto SushiSamba a bit after me, and ordered it again, so it must be worthwhile.\n     Overall it was a GREAT dining experience. I will DEFINITELY be back for more. I will probably make this a staple for dining everytime i head back to Las Vegas.",4
"If you're looking for a basic manicure or spa pedicure De Bon Nails does a pretty good job. The prices are reasonable, it's comfortable, and relatively clean. If you're wanting acrylics, gel manicures, etc. you're better off going elsewhere. I started getting gel manicures over the summer. They're supposed to last 2-3 weeks. With one exception, the four I had done at De Bon Nails lasted a week before breaking/peeling. They never offered to fix them and when I asked why it was happening they just shrugged. The last time I went I suspect the woman giving me my manicure was being coached by the person sitting next to her (not 100% sure since they weren't speaking English). And I had three nails break off within five days. Since I started going elsewhere I haven't these problems. Which leads me to think it is the salon/manicurist as opposed to my nails.",1
"Great Service, Good food.",3
"I've been waiting to see this show for over a year.  I was very excited to say the least, I suppose my expectations were high.  There were about 3 great song performances of the 20+ songs.  The artists are very talented and some of the acts are impressive. \n\nWe enjoyed the octopus garden, the skaters, the bubbles and the trampolines.\n\nOn the other hand, there were many performances that seemed random and I became bored throughout.  While I realize the artists work very hard and I'm not disrespecting their skills or talents, I think the choreographers should start an advisory council and go back to the creative stage and re-design the choreography.",1
they are absolutely great!!!,4
"I honestly didn't spend a whole lot of time in this place, but after snacking on the food trucks outside, we headed inside for a couple of beers. Most of the beers were $2 or $3, which is pretty great. And there was a live band, which was pretty good. The ambiance is that of a typical 24/7 bar - not much to write home about. But overall, it's not a bad spot.",2
I've been to Namaste once and had the lunch buffet. The food seemed very stale and the quality passable. Not at all something we'd frequent again. The topper is the fact that Namaste has been shut down multiple times for health code violations. That just does not sit will with me.\n\nThe recent reviews seem to suggest the food has improved. I'm not sure about that as I don't dare eat there after my first experience and their hygiene issues.,0
"Their interpretation of mac and cheese was bland and greasy, kind of gross.  The short rib entree was ok.  This seems like one of those restaurants where the food doesn't seem to live up to the wonderful descriptions on the menu. \n\nIt's a nice concept and I agree with a previous reviewer that the lack of TVs is refreshing.  I hope that's a trend that catches on with more restaurants.  Hopefully they can get the kinks out.",1
"Everything about this place is amazing. The food, drinks, and staff are the best. By far the best Italian food I've had in Vegas, reminds me of being back home in NY. I can't wait to go back.",4
"Horrible.\nThe place smelled soo bad, had no choice but to walk right out! \nno wonder is always so empty...",0
"Cole Haan has always been a trusted brand for me. I have had numerous pairs of dress shoes and years of comfort and style. I was so happy to see the Cole Haan store at the Biltmore. \n\nOkay first let me say that I lived a long time in San Diego so my attire is usually a t-shirt, shorts and flip flops. The Cole Haan store has a more upscale feel to it when you go in. I felt way under dressed as I do a lot of times. Hahahaha. Hey I like comfort. Well you would have never thought I was dressed like a beach bum. \n\nThe sales team was very attentive and helped me find the perfect pair of boots for my girlfriend. Even offered me some water. Nice touch. Found a better deal than the Cole Haans in Macy's. Always a plus. I will be back again.",4
"*** Sushi review only----Huge HUGE mistake going here and not reading the reviews first. \nOrdered 5 items charged 80 dollars and everything I ordered was in edible. Bad cuts of not fresh fish so tough I couldn't eat them. Mixed veg/shrimp tempura disgusting, the oil tasted bad. For the price it was a very tiny order.  Asked for it to be taken away and we were STILL charged for it. I don't even want to finish writing this review, this place pisses me off that much. Wait staff totally snotty/could care less and getting the bill \""adjusted\"" to 80 bucks was a nightmare.   Stay away!",0
"You can pretty much copy-paste all the previous comments/reviews here too.  \n\nLazy service, under/mismanaged, dirty, poor products.  Unfortunate too, because they have the tools and opportunity to be a really, really neat niche.  The GC in Litchfield Park is WAY better.  C'mon Ground Control, get your managing act together!",0

"Accidentally left $750 Ipad in cart, called store over 2 days to see if it was turned in & told no. Left my # every time. Filed police report, asked manager to review surveillance but he refused (I knew exact location & time - no brainer case). \n\nWent in following day to 'kindly request' their help...discovered employees had my Ipad stashed in a drawer the entire time. A Good Samartian turned it right after I left it, 28 hours prior! \n\nStore never called me after 28 hours of agonizing, changing passwords, wasted police & my time. Gave no explanation, perhaps someone there planned to take it(?). God Bless the person who turned this in. Good Karma 3-fold to you!",0
Kiss my grits!  If you like good service with old fashioned attitude you'll love this place.  F A S T delivery of a delicious breakfast A++  They also have this sliced and fried potato and homemade salsa that rocks.  Don't  expect  T Cooke's brunch or anything- its in the older part of Sunnyslope.  But DO go for the food and friendly help.,3
"Planned Parenthood here sucks. \n\nI come from California where there's plenty of them, and they're quick and a affordable way for someone like me who currently doesn't have insurance to keep up with the health of my lady parts. I have lots of health issues with them girls so where I can save a little is important. Here, nothing is provided free or very low cost, it's just somewhat cheaper than going to a doctor.  In Cali it's more like a low cost/free clinic.\n\nI mainly come for birth control pills since I have a condition where I need something to set out a proper body pattern or else my hormones are wonky and make for quite a lot of bad side effects. It's very important for me to have them on a regular. It's about $27 for a pack here, which is almost half the price with buying it from a pharmacy. \n\nNow after a year, your prescription expires. I go and drop in every month or two to get my meds and  the months before my prescription expired no one on the staff mentioned it. They check every time your chart to see the prescription, so the expiration is in their face each time. I go in needing my meds, and they said since it's expired I have to see the doctor again (which is $30-35 dr. visit). I really don't need to see anyone to have the prescription filled again since none of the girls at the clinic actually write the prescription- a doctor at another location does and they just fax it over and I have no other issues to speak to them about. Also, I was there at the end of the day (30 minutes before they close) so I needed to schedule something for a future date to have the prescription refilled. \n\nUH, Hello? If this was someones heart medication your ass would be in trouble but since I'm just some lowly kid who presumably takes pills for contraception then it's not a big deal, right?! No apology about not telling me. Sure, there are ways for me to keep track of it too, like mark this on my calendar, but I know this is part of their job to check prescriptions and remind about renewals. The Cali ones are busier and they CALL YOU to remind 2 months ahead to check if you need a renewal even though it's easy to keep track when you need pills since they dispense in 6 or 12 packs at a time.\n\n I was so dumbfounded with how they handle things that I just left and decided I'll take my chances with being sick and in pain while my hormone levels go down the tubes.\n\nAnother shtick is why I go when they are about to close for the day on Saturdays. Previously we would go drop in on the way to work since it's more convenient than driving all the way down on a day off. However, there were times where I'd sit there for 30 minutes waiting on them to dispense my pills. With 4 people SITTING and GOSSIPING in the office and not doing anything particular, I shouldn't have to be waiting for pills. Sometimes I tell them I'm going to be late for work, and it takes them still a while to call me up. I go when they're closing because they actually do their job properly (because they want to go home!) and take the simple steps of checking my file, printing out the label, grabbing the pack, placing the label on it and then swipe my credit card. It's less than a 5 minute process. I can understand a little wait for an appointment, but they are ridiculous here. It took 2 hours until my named was called WITH AN APPOINTMENT and spent sometime waiting for a physician as well....3 hours for maybe 20 minutes of actual \""face time\"". What' ridiculous is if it was that backed up I don't understand why the girl who did my consult spent most of her time in the front chatting with the other girls....uhhh, okay there's another technician, but shouldn't you guys both work at the same time to process everyone? The other technician also came out often and joined into things. This is why you can't put a bunch of friends without a management figure together. This one doesnt have a doctor on site all the time, only some of the days.\n\n....This was a sorority, not a clinic. \n\nI actually think PP in California does some good for the community (don't get on my case anti abortionist, I'm not talking about that) with the access it gives to people for responsible ways to play safe and have it at very affordable prices or for free that you're a fucking idiot if you don't go to help yourself.  I used to donate to PP in California when I was in positions to have excess to give back to the community and later down the line their service was there for me when I did not have much money and needed care. \n\nThe ones out here are a JOKE and highly unprofessional. It just confirms the idea of how Vegas has shit care when it comes to health....\n\nI left work today actually since I couldn't handle functioning with how bad it was today....something that could be avoided if they did their job right. I have an appt. with a doctor in California on Saturday and never coming back here.",0
"I was not impressed with Olives.  It was very high priced and the food was nothing special.  We shared a open faced Muffaletta, which was good, but not for $20.  I got the Butternut Squash Tortelli, it was horrible, nothing like the menu described.  I ended up having them box it and then gave it to a homeless man on our way back to our hotel.  I felt bad because I paid so much for it I didn't want to see them just throw it away and I was definitely not going to eat it then or later.  I only ate three bites of the whole thing, it was that bad, I couldn't choke it down.  The waiter was snobby also, only good service we had was from the busser.  I'm sure there are plenty of better places to eat in Vegas for that price range.",1
"I'm not going to say that I absolutely know what I'm talking about when it comes to BBQ.  I will simply list my credentials. Born in Utah where a mix of BBQ exists, mostly commercial type fare and some pit type of stuff I then moved to Cincinnati where a whole different breed of BBQ extists.  Tangy sweet sauce, fruity and tart, some boiled meat, some smoked.  I then moved to Florida where Southern BBQ rules, lots of smoke, multitudes of sauce choices in one sitting: Sweet, Hot, Spicy/Sweet, Mustard, smokey, a selection of heaven on one table with lots of smoke and rub to complete things.  On to North Carolina where the sauce is light and vinegar-y, more of a salad dressing than a \""sauce\"" but delicious all the same, the pulled pork topped with sauce and some tangy coleslaw.  In Chicago we eat BBQ at Coopers, hearty sauce and crisp from the grill, the ribs there are intense and flavorful, different from the south and from Cincinnati but delicious all the same.  Roadside BBQ pits in FL, GA, TN and TX have been some of my favorites that I can't name.  I like to think that I have some experience in BBQ since it is a food I love like mad.\n\nSo we've covered what I know from the past.  This is what I know now: This place sucks.  Tasteless and bland and as my husband mentioned \""weird\"", this \""BBQ\"" was both overpriced and beyond grisly.  We both had the ribs and the brisket, both were boiled and I'm fairly certain all the flavor was tossed out with the water.  The brisket was so fatty that we didn't eat it.  The ribs were the texture of semi-melted wax chips without much meat on them.  I'm fairly certain they just mashed potatoes and added coloring and some red pepper and called it potato salad, there was no flavor to that either.  We will never go back.  I really hate giving one star to any place, but honestly, this place ranks about 0 stars.  Rank, that about describes it.",0
"Went here with my roommate last week for a late breakfast and was pleasantly surprised! I got the Eggs Benedict and a chocolate croissant while my roommate went for the French toast with fresh fruit. Everything was very tasty, although my roommate could have easily handled a larger portion. \nAll the employees were super sweet and the French owner's eclectic playlist really added to how much I enjoyed the experience. Will have to go again for lunch or dinner!",3
You flew here and arrived from out of Canada.  You will walk about 1/2 mile through walkways that have non-operational moving floors.  You will wait a minimum 30 minutes to go through customs.  \n\nThere are 6 maybe 10 customs agents servicing a few hundred people.\n\nPeople with connecting flights will be moved through right before you.\n\nNone of the signs make sense.\n\nhopefully this will make your arrival into this airport better.,1
"We went there at 1:30 pm on a Sunday afternoon and the service was AWFUL!!  We ordered the Italian salad and a pizza. It took them 50 minutes to get our food out to us!   There were people who ordered after us who were getting their lunch.  The place was not busy.  I finally asked if they had lost our ticket, the server was very rude and just said we had a sudden rush.  What?  There were 4 tables outside with people and at the most 5 inside!  I ordered my dressing on the side and of course it came saturated with it along with wilted lettuce!  The pizza was just ok, nothing spectacular.  If you want a GREAT salad and pizza, drive 5 minutes south to Oregano's.  I was very disappointed because the atmosphere was so modern and great!  So, in a nut shell!  The atmosphere is GREAT, the service is lousy and the food is not even \""ok\"". My guess is with all of the places that have great service and excellent food that this place will not be around much longer.  Not even in the same realm as Postino's or LG Orange.",0
"Worst physician experience of my life. Spent a total of 10 minutes with the spine specialist, and that's only because I had the nurse bring him back into the room to spend more time with me. Got the bill today...$399 for 10 minutes! Unbelievable! I'm in the wrong industry if a specialist can literally not even examine a patient and make hundreds. Shameful.",0
worst towing company in the Vegas  area.  They are completely rude on the phone!,0

I went there to get a quote on Oakley lens repair and they wanted over $200.00.  Found them on ebay for $20.00.  Then went back to have 1 screw put in a different pair of glasses and they wanted $20.00 for 1 screw!! This place is a rip off.  Don't waste your time going.,0
"Really great burger. Cooked perfect and juicy. Onion rings are the best in town. Not greasy and when you bite in, you don't get a mouthful of onion. Would come back in a heartbeat. Only complaint would be service. Their fast lane for custard and drinks was being used for everything so if you had a small order, you were stuck behind a long line. Then we had to wait for the other registers to have people to take orders. Still worth the wait.",3
"Longtime downtown spot on 10th and Charleston. Salvadoran and Mexican. Nice, big place inside with comfortable seating and good service. We had all the pupupas, cheese, pork, been with cheese and a combo of beans, cheese and pork. Really sumptuous pockets of corn based dough. Be careful, the fillings are hot. Served with a vinegar slaw and tomato sauce. Mammon, good. Did I mention they were $1.50. That's no typo. Tamales are a buck fifty too. The Elote tamale is a sweet, light bundle of yum. Beef burrito, enchilada style with rice and beans all tasting great - $6.50. Beautiful shrimp enchilada with tons of decent sized shrimp. We ended our meal with Fried plantains that were served with a sweet cream sauce - so good. Highly recommend for downtown eating.",4
"My girls (age 6 & 8) love coming here for the Parent's Night Out.  It costs me $25 each to drop them off to play and have pizza from 7pm-11pm.  \n\nI wish the hours were 6pm to 10pm instead.  Also, my daughter said the pizza wasn't very good last time.\n\nHowever, the pros outweigh the cons and we are fans.",3
"Guess I'm the odd woman out in this string of reviews! My husband and I stayed here on Memorial Day evening to get away for our anniversary, and we both detested almost every aspect of our experience. Thanks a lot, Priceline! We had bid $75 for a \""Resort\"" in the Phoenix area, and at that bid, we probably deserved what we got, but we're still a little bitter :). When we pulled up the driveway to check in, it seemed promising. There were lots of trees and flowers, and everything looked really clean. \n\nThe bad part started when we went in to check in. The clerk informed us that they were only \""40% full\"" and therefore had our pick of room locations - any floor, any view, etc. We told him we wanted a first-floor pool view. Easy enough. Then he asked if we \""preferred\"" two queens or a king. Well, since we weren't planning on having any additional overnight guests, we let him know we preferred a king. Well, despite the 40% occupation rate that he had advertised just seconds earlier, he told us that this \""upgrade\"" would carry a $20 fee. We declined and were really annoyed - rather than make a hospitable gesture and offer us a king, which clearly wasn't in high demand - they insisted on charging us. Just a lost opportunity to please the customer! As someone else already mentioned, the resort fee of $16 also seemed useless - it included overnight parking (on a roof-top, unshaded lot), free internet (IF you happened to bring our laptop, which most pleasure travelers wouldn't), 2 bike rentals (we just wanted to go to the pool!), and a \""coffee bar\"" (some carafes of coffee on a table in a dark corridor). Blech. \n\nWe went to our room, at least hoping it would be nice. Well, it wasn't. To start with, it was incredible dark, but rather than offering curtains, the first-floor room had dark wood plantation shutters - opening them barely let any light in. One of the floor lamps was also broken. The dark wood trim, accessories, and enormous amoire gave off more of a Spanish monastery vibe than a posh Scottsdale resort. The bathroom was also nothing to write home about - the shower was really small and the curtain looked dingy. To top it all off, we turned on the TV and every channel had a fuzzy picture. \n\nSo, you ask, were there any positives? Ok, ok, sitting out by the pool was great (although I attribute that more to the gorgeous Phoenix weather) than the pool (the surface was peeling in a bunch of places, and the walls around the pool were literally covered in moss, which looked to be due to neglect and not a stylistic choice) but the $3.50 well margaritas we had at the pool bar (happy hour 3:30-6:30) were surprisingly good, as were the crab taquitos we ordered as a snack. If you love outdated and overgrown, you'll love this resort. Otherwise, avoid it.",0
"I find out that Saturn has stopped making Roof Racks for my 2003 Saturn Vue which means I cannot get a Roof Rack for my Bikes for road trips, bummer deal. Then I remember how hitch racks have gotten really awesome and that I can get a hitch installed. Well who do you go to for a hitch installation? Google results show that Uhaul is the masters of the hitch install and that being that I call Uhaul. This is where the fun begins, and by fun I mean something akin to stabbing my eyes with a pencil.\n\nThere is a Uhaul, to my chagrin, very close to my house, so I figure it will be most convenient to call them. After numerous rings I get to talk with Robin. It doesn't sound like Robin is having the best of days, or years, or perhaps longer. I tell her that I would like a hitch installed on my car and we go through the make model year routine to determine what I need installed. She wants to know where I want this done, which is an odd question since I called a specific location. We get through that and she gives me the price of $179.95 for parts, labor, and warranty. She lets me know that it may be more depending on how the wiring configuration is done but I let her know that I will not need that since I am putting a bike rack on and that will be it for the foreseable future. I get a confirmation number and she emails me the receipt. I am also told that someone will contact me to setup the appointment. This is June 10th.\n\nOn June 12th, Friday, I still have not received a call so I decide to give the Uhaul location a call back to see whats up with the appointment. I offer my confirmation number but the gentleman just wants my name. He says that the appointment is set up for Wednesday June 17th. I am surprised by this since no one ever called to set that up. I ask if we can get it done on Monday June 15th instead. The gentleman says yes that will be fine and to bring it in at 8am and that it should only take 30 minutes. I enter this into my calendar and go about my weekend.\n\nJune 15th rolls around and I go to the Uhaul for my scheduled appointment for the hitch installation. I am greeted by a gentleman walking away from me to talk with another Uhaul employee, or rather Manager/Owner James Flake. After an awkward minute of me standing at the counter 5 feet away from these two gentlemen talking about their work I finally am greeted by the younger one. I let him know that I am here for my scheduled hitch install which causes him to look over my shoulder to James and laugh. He then lets me know that James will be doing the install. I ask if I should bring the car around back and he thinks this is a good plan.\n\nAs I pull around I see another customer waiting on James and can see that things are going to be moving slowly today. I wait in my car for 10 minutes until James comes up and asks if I know that this appointment is set for Wednesday. I tell him that yes I am aware that originally it was set for that that but that I had called on Friday to reschedule. He lets me know that its going to take a while as he has deliveries to take care of but that I will be his priority. I am okay with this since I have brought my book along and have no appointments till the afternoon.\n\n10am rolls around and James Flake comes in to let me know its all done. We saddle up to the register and he tells me the total is ~$220 which I inform him is incorrect. I tell him that the total parts, labor, and warranty was quoted to me as $179.95. He snickers at me and wants to know who told me that. I explain that it was Robin to which he responds that Robin does not work there. I let him know that it is irrelevant as I was quoted $179.95 and that is what I will be paying. Another Uhaul employee comes over to see what the fuss is about and they start discussing that I was quoted the online price for the hitch which is cheaper than their price. I stand and say nothing to this.\n\nJames is still not willing to offer the price I was quoted so he lets me know that he can take the hitch off. I let him know he is welcome to do so. He then tells me that I will have to wait since he has other customers. This cracks me up because there is nothing better for your other customers than to have one who you are trying to Bait and Switch standing in your store raising hell.\n\nAnother Uhaul employee comes over and his name tag says owner as well. By this time I have found the email and let them see it. They agree to honor the price and I am on my way.\n\nClearly Uhaul has some communication issues between its stores and the central call center that my initial call was routed to. The first issue this caused was that I never got a call back for when the installation would occur. Second when I called to setup the installation time I talked with the store where I was apparently talking to someone too busy to actually write down the appointment that we set up. Third was the price issue.",0
"Say Neigh to the Silverton's Seasons Buffet!\nI went to the Seasons buffet for Christmas.  The cost was $58.00 for two people.  The food was okay until I had the prime rib.  It had a very gamely flavor.  On closer inspection I realized that there was no marbling and the fat was a very bright yellow.  They were serving horse meat and passing it off as beef!  When I pointed it out to the server, one of the hostesses came over to speak with us.  She offered to bring out the chef, but I told her it was unnecessary.  I had horse meat years before and never forgot the look or taste.  She took our comment card and we saw her throw it away.  We did another and turned it in to the cashiers desk.  Funny thing, as we left we noticed that they had changed out the horse meat prime rib and was now serving beef!",0
"If you want that trashy '70s feel with old-school slots and low-stakes gaming, then look no further.

But I came out $50 ahead, so I'm happy. Worth a short visit if you're sick of the Strip.",2

"I CRAVE a good solid ice cream shoppe. Back home in the good mid-west Ohio we have several to choose from and I was lucky enough to grow up just miles from one of the best. Fresh hand scooped flavors that changed once one flavor was favored and ran out. The next being better then the last. At an early young age my stomach sang a song for Blue Moon, it's bright almost neon blue color and a taste some would say is like fruity pebbles. **drooling** I never get home in the summer time which is only when they are open so I miss this place a lot especially my Blue Moon unless I can convince my Mom, Sister or Grandma to tightly wrap a quart for me that can last in the freezer for four to five months. Now that I have hopefully painted a picture of what I miss most of home, a wonderful ice cream shoppe, which completely lack in this town I'll move along to Luv-it's. Luv-Its should be a nice substitute to hold that craving at bay but should be are the key words.  \n\nThis was not as good as I remember it being the last time I had it which was awhile ago, probably four to five years. I begged my BF to take me to satisfy my ice cream shoppe craving. I mean I begged and pleaded him to drive to the the other side of town to get it. I was super stoked to find a B1G1 coupon on the 8News website! I made sure to read the fine print about it needing to be printed. None found so off we went. I was so excited!! \n\nWhen we got there they wouldn't take my coupon because it needed to be printed out. I said it did not specify that, the cashier yelled for someone finally she came out and said the same thing and I said again it didn't specify that. She said that it's per owner they couldn't take it. Ugh! I don't have a laser printer to quickly and randomly print unnecessary things so I wasn't going to print it just incase. I told her they should contact the website to make sure they put that on the coupon. But this wasn't keeping me from getting the custard, as annoying as it was. \n\nI got the Western Sundae and he got the Brownie Sundae.  His was bigger and cheaper then mine, around $5.65(I forget exact amounts) his had walnuts, fudge and brownie pieces. Mine was around $5.95 and had caramel, fudge and pecans. Hmm wonder who did this math. The taste was not that of homemade custard or of what I remember it being years ago. BIG SAD FACE!! I was only left with a bigger craving for my ice cream shoppe ice cream!! \n\nA lot of the reviews were bad because of the location. Yea there were two cop cars at the gas station next door handcuffing someone and a homeless chick in the garbage, I just laughed because that stuff doesn't scare me. A cop is there and the lady is just wanting dinner. That's not what would steer me away from this place, the bad ice cream and the non caring staff will. I don't usually plug a better place to go, people can choose whether they side with my review or not but Nielson's in Henderson is WAY better. Too bad it's soooo far from my house.",1

"Terrible, terrible place. I walked in wanting to make an appointment and there was no receptionist. That's not a good sign of customer service for me. But oh it got worse. I was looked at by the two stylists working and after a few minutes of standing there awkwardly one finally comes over. He wasn't very friendly and seemed too busy to even help. So I decided to leave. I go back a few days later hoping for a different feel and it got even worse. I went in and there was no receptionist and one stylist. She had to leave the client she was working on (which would piss me off if that were me) and goes \""what do you need?\"" To me. And I said \""make an appointment?\"" And she repeats \""what do you need?\"" A little confused I assumed she meant so I said \""hair cut and ombre\"" Then she looks at the books and goes \""oh thank god I'm off tomorrow\"" wow. That shows me you hate your job and that's the last stylist id want doing my hair. Then, rudely, she says you can come in tomorrow at 4. And I said well that won't do I work till 530 but just across the street so I was hoping for a 6? And she said no. Ombre takes at least 3 hours and we close at 8 ......... I was so appalled. First off, I've had blonde in my hair numerous times before. It doesn't take that long and besides I was going for a caramel look so it would've been maybe a 30 lift for half hour tops. Not THREE HOURS. She didn't even ask the specifics of what I wanted to gauge the time better. And the fact that she refused to stay open a little later for a client??? As a new local business that's stupid. This place will be closed within 6 months IF THAT. I didn't get her name (purplish hair - older) but it doesn't seem to matter who you get- they're all just rude.",0
"A group of us went to Geisha House for the teppanyaki and had a great time.  The prices were reasonable and the special, which was chicken, filet mignon, and lobster, all with the included sides of veggies, rice, soup and salad, was only like $35.  My friend and I both ordered a roll, mine was the What the Heck and she ordered Tastes Like My Ex-Girlfriend, they were both delicious but the rolls in addition to the grill food was soooo much food!!!  It all made great leftovers :D\nThe teppanyaki show was, of course, very fun.  Our chef was sociable and talented at volcanoes and egg cracking.  This places uses pink butter which I found a little weird (perhaps to hide undercooked food?  I'm not saying they have undercooked food, I'm just being a bit of a conspiracy theorist), but still tastes amazing and all your food has a pretty pink colour!\nService was excellent, my roll was made in the wrong order but with all the right ingredients, and the manager brought it out to make sure that was okay, which I thought was a nice touch.  The soup was very good, I can't remember what all was in it but we all enjoyed it.  There is a peach sake - YOU WANT THAT.  Do not drink it as a beer or wine cooler, even though it may appear to be and taste like one.  My hubby loves teppanyaki and I'm a big sushi fan; this is definitely our new favourite place when we're craving those!",3
Don't leave Vegas without going to this dive....BBQ Ribs & Chicken (at the Brewery) are the best in town and cheap too (if you have your player's card)!!!,4
"I went to Miriam to get a hair cut, and the first time was great. The second time was not. I showed her specific pictures of how I wanted my hair cut. She didn't cut it the way the pictures showed nor the way I wanted it. I thought I would give her one last chance to fix it, so I went back. I wish I wouldn't have. First of all, I had to wait over a hour for her to show up at the salon. She said she thought the appointment was for another day. It wasn't, I had the day and time on my voicemail. I know it wasn't the front desk's fault but they could have acted more Courteous.  Another stylist offered to do my hair. I wish I would have let her. When she finally showed up, she acted like it was more my fault and it was no big deal. She did say sorry but it seemed like, I'm sorry I had to come to work. I told her what the problem was with the cut and showed her again pictures of what I wanted. For me it's hard to tell in the salon sometimes how the cut has come out. Also, I didn't think I would have to pay the regular amount, because I had been in there a month or less. She took ten off because she was late. Then later when I had the chance I really looked at my hair. The layers were uneven. She had left a big chunk of hair longer than the other, etc. I'm having to grow my hair out before I can get it cut, so I'm really not happy! I've had other problems with Leidan Mitchell also.",0
"What an awesome little music hideaway! Seeing the venue from the street view just made me think that this place might be leaning towards the sketchy side... which threw me off because the lineup of events is quite stellar!\n\nFirst thing - the entrance and parking us behind the venue...which is an entirely different world.\n\nBunkhouse is like a discovery zone! Upon entry, there is an old piano that you can play. TONS of spaced out outdoor seating... looks like chairs and tables collected from yard sales and thrift shops but it's super cool! There is also a music tree to your left. The music tree is fantastic at night! There are about a dozen headphones hanging from lights on that tree... each one featuring a different genre of music/sound. We listened to each of them and found some favorites. While outside you can also order food and drinks at their outdoor bar. We learned that you don't have to pay cover to play outside... there are speakers surrounding the outdoor space so that you can hear what's going on inside. But if there is an event, the cover will be charged when you go to enter the actual building. \n\nInside the building is a stage (on the smaller side) seemingly set for more intimate feeling shows. There's a full service bar, tables that line the walls and a nice sized area in the middle to dance and/or crowd around the stage. The bar has seating surrounding it - kind of a U shape. They have a nice selection of beer, wish they had more draft selections, but thats the beer snob in me. Inside there were flyers saying that every night (didn't give a specific time) the draft beers are $3. :) \n\nOur first trip to Bunkhouse was for a local hip hop artist showcase but we will be returning for a DJ event in November. I will be sure to update my review then!\n\nAs of now though, I am a fan of Bunkhouse. Can't wait to try what their kitchen has to offer!",3
"This is a cute coffee shop to have nearby. In the 3 times I've been here, seating has never been a problem, which is nice. The barristas have been fairly nice as well. On Sundays they have a brunch like menu, with eggs, bacon, biscuits and gravy, potatoes, etc. Nom nom.  \n\nI take issue with the fact that they don't brew their own iced tea. That may seem trivial, but they are a cafe, and so I think it's a cop out. The music is generally good, it's usually too loud to get work done. I would explore more of the options in the area, since there seems to be a lot.",2
"After attempting to visit Ollie Vaughn's a couple times (but showing up when they were closed, boo!) the husband and I finally got to try this hidden gem out. The people who work here are lovely, friendly, and helpful people. We came at breakfast time during the week, so they weren't busy. Their egg sandwich is a 'build your own' egg sandwich, which I love! You can chose between a croissant or a biscuit (I got a biscuit), chose your cheese, how you want the egg, what meat you want, and veg. I had an over medium egg on biscuit with roasted tomatoes, gruyere cheese, and bacon.... it wasn't as good as my fave breakfast sandwich (when that one is good), but it was a close second. Very tasty and fresh. The husband had the biscuits and gravy... he loved it. The gravy was exceptional, they really let the quality of the ingredients shine... and it tasted good on the egg sandwich (new creation? I think so...). Their coffee was also good, they get it from a local roaster in Glendale. We also tried their cinnamon buns later that night, and they were soft and tasty... not overly sweet like some cinnamon buns can be. Needless to say, I will definitely be back!\n\nPS Their decor is SO cute and their patio looks amazing if it weren't a thousand degrees outside\n\nPPS 950, woohoo!",3
"I love this place because it combines so many things I dig: sandwiches, Italianism, a great wine selection, and an overall nice casual atmosphere. If I had a market, I'm pretty sure it would be like this one if I could help it.\n\nThe one critical thing I would add is that next time I'm craving DeFalco's on a Saturday at around noon, I think I'll call in the order. It's a rather popular place for lunch.",3
"I was there with my mom and BF just after New Year's. We were going to eat dinner there but the host said there was a wait with no reservation (we didn't see the inside of the club) so we bought it and had dinner elsewhere. Mom still wanted to hear live music so we came back and again they said there was nothing available without a reservation. But we could sit at the tiny bar counter. \n\nWe sit at the counter and see at least a dozen EMPTY TABLES. Finally, for s**** and giggles I pull up my Open Table App and guess what? There was a reservation available so I made one and walked up to the hostess saying \""We have a reservation, can we get a table now?\""\n\nWe got seated, had a few drinks, the server was OK, but this place is nothing special and the BS about needing a reservation is REALLY stupid.\n\nThe live music was entertaining but not amazing. In fact the female lead singer missed some of the words and a few high notes.\n\nMIGHT go back with a coupon if I have my Open Table app working :-/\n\nSo 1 star for the overall experience, another for the fact I now know Open Table works well on the Android phone I have which is great for traveling.",1
"I have been coming here for many years now. Most of the time, it's a job well done. Today I was happy with the Supreme car wash but the time was crazy. It took 56 minutes for my car to be done. I actually looked at my receipt because it was taking so long. I'm not sure which is more important to you, quality or speed. For me, I have high expectations and think for $30, I should get both.",2
"I've been a member of this gym for a year or two and I like that it is really clean, nice, equipment is up to date, even if it's busy I don't really have to wait for any machines.. love the eucalyptus steam room, the group classes, the fitness instructors and many of the staff members I've met. \n\nI haven't ever used the pools or childcare center so I can't comment on that.\n\nOverall it is a good gym (and I've been to many for comparison's sake) and I really enjoy it, but the only thing I dislike is like some others have said in their reviews, much of the management seems like a cult that don't truly care much about its members but are purely business-focused (much like you'd see in many other big companies across different industries). I don't get how so many in management don't seem to understand that being good to customers and employees as well as establishing a good (and not a snakey) reputation IS good for business. I've seen and heard a lot of sketchy things about them and some of the best fitness instructors/trainers have left due to one or more members of the management being unreasonable. Not all that surprising since it is a very corporate gym.\n\nBut, for the most part, many people probably won't notice that part of it and will very much enjoy their experience here. It personally hasn't majorly affected my own experience there, but it's just one of those things that makes the gym less appealing and would make me think about switching if a comparable one that wasn't so corporate popped up in the area (there's a great one in Glendale called \""XL Health Club\"" that comes to mind -- it is a spacious gym with awesome people across the board and has a more homey feel).",2
"Our experience with Little Friends has been outstanding thus far.  We've been using Little Friends for the past 6 months and we've had about 7-8 sitting experiences.  We have 2 cats, one requiring shots for diabetes and overnight stays.  Little Friends has provided 2 excellent sitters who take care of everything.  The communications from the company via phone, email, and text is excellent.  We're able to line up appointments online, which are confirmed quickly.  Payments are set up via credit card (also easy).  Our favorite feature is the sitter will communicate with you via text while you're away, and they leave a detailed log of what they did while you were gone.  Excellent service my wife and I would recommend to anyone with pets.  We plan to continue using them well into the future.",4
"This sushi place is both mine and my husbands #1 choice! We are both huge sushi lovers, and have tried many sushi places and this is by far the best one. We start of by getting an appetizer each and 5-6 rolls and a dessert for each and our bill always comes out to less than $60! Def worth every cent! Music is great, staff very friendly the whole atmosphere makes us keep going back! Makes it very hard to want to try a new place.",4
Better than diner food. Not a fine dining restaurant. Fried catfish was tasty. Home style cooking. The server was good. Time to get the meal after the order taken was a bit slow. \nWatch their drink prices. A friend ordered a peach something drink and it was $19.00. (That's crazy). Ask the price before you order. Some nights they have live music.,2
"We came here because I wanted to try something different. This place had very good reviews on Yelp so I thought I would give it a try and I'm glad I did. Bobby Q had really great food, service and an all around great experience.",4
"The time was 11:45 and me and my cousin were going to place a order, but they said they were closed. so me and my cousin left disappointed because they closed 15 minutes early but on top of that when we were looking for a other place to eat using  my phone in my cousin's car. A other customer comes in and places a order.  This is what I call bad customer service. my question is why would you serve him and not us. to me that might have been racial profiling and that is not okay in my book.",0
Good food and good entertainment.  Food is good and plentiful.  Where the Key West Margaritaville lacks in flare this place has it.,3
"The service here is ok, depending on the time of day.  What is pretty funny is in the morning the first thing we always got asked was if we needed a drink to cure our hangover.   So on Saturday and Sunday I ordered the Chicken Fried Steak for breakfast.  It was pretty good. Anywhere I go, if a place has chicken fried steak, I'll try it.  This place did not disappoint.  On Sunday everyone at my table ordered Chicken Friend Steak accept one person, because I thought it was good. After they tried it, they were glad they ordered it.  It has the right amount of batter to meat ratio.\n\nI didn't like the coffee shake.  It didn't taste like coffee, and Jack in the box can make a better shake.  But I will go there anytime I stay at the Hard Rock and really there is either this or the Pink Taco. Pink Taco was good too, but that is another review.",2
Went  and enjoyed this delicious grub today! Had the coarse chop BBQ  and the Pork sandwich with pimento cheese and fried pickles. What a strange combo but it was delightful. The onion rings were only ok. The rest was super yummy!,4
"Every room includes a Bible and a paperback copy of Conrad Hilton's 'Be My Guest.'  Thankfully, I had other things to do than actually read it.  The forward by his son was a self-important waste of paper that made me want to check out right then and there. The rooms and level of service at this hotel are really nice, though.\n\nGreat downtown location and nice clean rooms.  The bathrooms give you the requisite number of towels and there are plenty of pillows.  However, my pillows smelled like body odor; that cost a star.\n\nEither side of the hotel will afford you great views of Capitol Square or Lake Monona.  Parking in their structures is a bit much ($12) for the city, but there are structures nearby and ample street parking during the weekends.  A restaurant and lounge operates within the building and from what I gather, they're as good as they look.",2
"Wednesday is Wingsday!!! All you can eat $12.99 And my server was the best! Crystal was so attentive, friendly, and kept are drinks topped off. I'm good w that. See ya next week Crystal!",4
"Occupying the space that was formerly Boston's, I'm going to predict that Wild Bull suffers a similar fate, sooner than later.  It is, for all intents and purposes nearly identical to what Boston's was - even the menu is eerily similar. \n\nThe place is still huge, an still very empty at most times. I've stopped by for drinks, lunch, and dinner on both weeknights and weekends and have never seen it more than 15-30% full. Lots of televisions and seating.\n\nService has been consistently unimpressive. Lackluster and \""cold.\""  Bartenders trudge around as if they'd rather be having a tooth removed than to pour a drink. Happy hour specials make the unfriendly service slightly tolerable, but given how \""remote\"" and empty this place is, I'd rather socialize elsewhere.\n\nFood was equally unimpressive. Nothing exciting or even tasty. Standard mediocre chain food fare; served a little chilly, and a little less fresh than I'd expect. Although, I'm guessing food isn't flying out of the kitchen so freshness probably suffers while inventory sits and ages.\n\nOn every visit, the wifi hasn't worked - on this last visit, I couldn't even find a wifi signal, even though they promote it on the door when you walk in.  And speaking of this last visit, I'm writing this at 5pm on Tuesday while watching the Packers Lambeau SuperBowl homecoming, and there are exactly 9 patrons here.  The bartender took 5+ minutes to get to us for beers, and when I pointed out that he gave me too much money back for change from my $10, he shrugged and sluffed away. I could've made $10 by keeping the extra change, and instead I get a \""hmm.\""\n\nWild Bull = FAIL\n\nService = 1.75 stars\nFood = 1.75 stars\nValue = 2.0 stars \nMisc = 2.5 stars (big, lots of tvs, no crowd)\n\n\nNo real upside to this place.

"I moved to Las Vegas a month ago.  When I arrived, my wife's car needed servicing, and mine conveniently needed a new starter.  A friend recommended SW Bimmers.  Man, I was not disappointed.\n\nService is the driving force here, and from the office manager, to the owner, they treat you like gold.  If the Four Seasons was in the car repair business, this is how it would be.  The shop is super clean, the reception area is not a luxury hotel, but clean, nice and comfortable.  The bathroom is even clean!  What a concept.\n\nI highly recommend SW Bimmers.  I'm a customer for life!",4
Used to be awesome but the new owner ruined this place. Servers are slow and clueless and the owner hangs out getting drunk with the weirdo regulars...or maybe those are his buddies. Its also not zoned for smoking but the owner ignores that. Stinky with scary cougars and pervs.,0
"Looked promising, the thing is this place isn't set up very well. Seems to be all the tables are jammed up in the middle with a few booths on one side. The bar is kind of dog-legs along the other wall. Where the band is set up, sitting at the bar is kind of awkward if you want to watch, because it's kind of behind everyone.\nBeer is cold though, 25 ounce drafts, we had 4 of those and 2 shots and paid about $30 so prices aren't bad. \nThe band was honestly not that good, wasn't loud though so more of just background music, but could be ignored if you wanted and still carry a conversation.\nVariety of patrons, old, young, military, etc. If you live in the area, probably a good place to grab a cold one.\nIt's not on my side of town but we wanted to try it and I doubt I'd drive over there again unless they changed it up a bit. \nSeriously it could be a good dive bar if they wanted that, darken it up, make some better seating, get a better band in there, etc",1
"Hot as in Turn On the A/C!!  Holy swamp balls batman.  This was one of our stops via Nite Tours and I wished this was not one of them.  The music was good, but it was crowded and there was about to be a throw down near me.   I didn't want my kicks to get messed up so I snitched on em and had security diffuse the tension.  Drink prices avg $12-14, decor was cool upstairs, and I was really not feeling the crowd at all.",1
"Ticoz, my love, what has happened to you?!\n\nThere was a point several years ago when I dined at Ticoz several times a month - it was my favorite restaurant!  They had great (free) salsas with chips, heaps of salads, a consistent and attractive wait staff, great bartenders, and delicious food.\n\nThese days, just about all of that is gone.  My final straw with this restaurant came last night when I realized they no longer serve their 3 different salsas (pico, pineapple, and hot).  They just have 1.  And its your typical run-of-the-mill \""mexican food salsa\"" - something you would find at Ajo Al's or Macayo's - standard, boring. \n\nThe portions seem smaller and greasier than they used to, while I'm pretty sure the prices have gone up.",1
If you like hanging around with 50 year old people then this is your spot! If you're not wearing adult diapers move on.,1
I have to say that this place is the best in LAS VEGAS... F@#$ Tacos El Gordo and PEPEs tacos... Plus the customer service is a big plus here. I am from San Francisco and it has been hard finding a good taqueria.. Hands down on this place.. The tacos are made with hand made tortillas. I totally recommend this place. We go once a week. The owner and his wife are so sweet and remember their customers names. Great place to get a fast service.. Their champurrado is awesome..,4
"Salmon Dry/overcooked..Servers are pleasant...but service a bit sloooow. We used to take our kids here years ago..., but I don't think we will return",1
"For starters, the food is always really good. \nThe service.....drives me nuts and makes me not go there as often.I truly appreciate fast service, but consistently being asked if I want to order dessert while I'm only 1/2 way through dinner makes me feel incredibly rushed. Not to mention when they clear my plate while my wife is still eating dinner makes her feel rushed. Now, if we go there at all, all we think about is whether the waitress is going to rush us out of there. \nI understand its a business, but this is not good service, faster is not always better. \nI'm from NY and we like things fast, except when we are trying to enjoy a nice meal. \nSolutions??",1
"We made a reservation for Valentines Day. It was busy but we were seated right away. Our server, however, was quite rude to us from the get go. We didn't order alcohol and that seemed to offend him. Also, my boyfriend ordered fries with his steak and our waiter rolled his eyes. The steak was out of this world juicy and tender but a bit peppery. I had the roasted garlic chicken and mashed potatoes. The chicken was dry and overcooked and the potatoes were cold. Our server never checked back with us during the entire meal to ask us how things were. In fact the only time anyone came to our table is when we waved someone down for some refills. We were finished eating for about 10 minutes when our server came by and picked our plates up. As he was about to set another plate on top of my food I told him I wanted it boxed up (hoping I could salvage it for home). His reply was, \""Oh! Okay, did you want me to do it?\"" He boxed it and set it on our table in a walk by. Then we waited another 5-10 minutes or so before he came back and asked if we'd saved room for dessert. We asked if we could see a dessert menu. It only tooks a minute or two to decide but we didn't see our server for another 5-7 minutes. (He seemed to only have 5 tables all together that evening). We ordered dessert and as we took maybe our third bite he came by and with the check. He checked back for payment two or three times while we were still enjoying our dessert - it was a chocholate cake with ice cream which was pretty good, not worth the price, but good. When we opened up the bill he had over charged us so we had to wait for him to check back again to ask him to fix it. We sat another 6-7 minutes while he fixed it, paid and left. We never even received a good bye or thanks for coming from a single staff member. It was a let down of an experience, even if my boyfriend's steak was good.",1
"Was it really 2011 when I first reviewed this pub, wow, that was a while ago... So what's changed?*\n\nThe spirit selection has grown to provide a great range of whisky, rum or gin, some of which are rarely seen premium products. The new(ish) Three Hop and Birra Moretti have replaced the Heineken as a premium draft lagers and there is now a 4th guest ale tap, so even more choice for the beer/lager enthusiast. Finally Symonds has replaced Strongbow, an improvement on the draft cider front. \n\nOn the food front, after taking part in the Tollcross chilli cook-off (recommended outing to all those who Yelp in Edinburgh) the chilli is really good. Chips cooked in beef dripping - they taste great! There have been one or two other menu tweaks, though the classics are all still in-place and tasty.\n\nThe prices are still reasonable and the bar itself is still well staffed and pleasant. So all in all Lock 25 is possibly verging on a great pub to have a drink or something to eat.\n\n*If I missed any changes put it down to sampling some of those spirits and the passing of time...",3
American Junkie advertised no cover and open bar from 8pm-10pm for NYE. There was a small line when we arrived but it wasn't moving. The door man said they were only checking in bottle service customers and they will let the general public in at 11pm. We asked about their open bar promotion and they said if we want to get in we have to pay $60. We were very unhappy with their customer service and happily went somewhere else that charged a cover but treated their customers with respect. Firehouse and The Lodge are better options if you are looking for a casual bar in Old Town Scottsdale.,0
"Last month a group of 10-15 of us went there for a bachelor party.  I was recommended here by a couple of friends.  We decided to get a VIP booth because of the sheer numbers of people that we had (roughly $1200 for 3 bottles).  Most of the girls are pretty, but a lot are really stuck up.  I had 4 girls literally walked away from me.  Here we are spending money and they think they are too good for us.  The waitress that waited at our booth was pretty nice, but somehow forgot about us at times.  Overall, I don't know if I'll go back to Spearment Rhino.",2

I had really hoped that auto shops had come away from trying to hustle female customers. Apparently I'm wrong. Disappointed.

"Fortunately, I didn't have the pleasure of experiencing the inside but I did however get to hang out with the drive thru crew at McD Union 3185. Not so customer friendly voice promoted me to make a selection and I quickly warmed her heart with my awesomeness and she changed her tune to a more friendlier approach.

First impressions - clean, small, open and friendly.   \n\nI really like spring rolls, so I didn't want to miss out on a wonderful opportunity.   I decided to splurge and get 2 orders of spring rolls and share with my friend.    I got the Shrimp and Pork (tom vat hit - #3A) and BBQ Pork (Thit Nuong - #3D).   Admittedly, after my first one, I didn't want to share!   They were excellent, fresh, and filling.   The Chili-lime fish sauce added an extra zing that made the experience even more rewarding.   \n\nFor the main course, accompanying the delectable delight of the appetizers (a meal in and of themselves), I decided on the Noodle Soup (Pho).   I went with the Rare steak, flank, brisket, tendon, and tripe rice noodle soup (Pho Tai, Nam, Chin Gan, Sach - #61).     It was delicious and very satisfying.   \n\nThere are so MANY other dishes on the menu!    I plan on going back as frequently as possible so that I can try them all.

"Wowsers, this stuff is good!  I love the concept of serving yourself and pay by weight!  You pick the flavor and there are plenty of toppings to choose from - healthy and not so healthy.   There are even little sample cups to try a couple flavors before committing.  Like others have said I would have liked a smaller cup choice, but then again I ended up filling the big cup pretty good so I'm guessing that's the point.  Too bad I forgot to bring my self control. \n\nAnyway, great idea for a yogurt place - and a friend I was with stated that it's on par with Pinkberry.  Yum!",4
"I have a professional pastry background and was severely disappointed with the lemon mousse. It was a plate of drops of \""sauce\"" with a very small, 1mm thick short bread cookie. It looked like a plate with decorations that was missing the actually mousse for $12.

I had a steak and fried shrimp special which included a soda (w/ free refills), all-you-can-eat salad bar, and the steak and shrimp w/ mashed potatoes.  Okay, so the mashed potatoes were crap... I'd recommend getting fries instead, or maybe something else...

We have been going to this restaurant since it opened and now only get our food to go, which brings up the second issue.  \n\nAll of the food is really good, with exception to the Fisherman's linguine or Cioppino, which ever they are calling the dish.  When I ordered the Fisherman's linguine it was described to be completely different from the Cioppino.  I ordered the Fisherman's linguine.  When I got the order home I found they had given me Cioppino, it was written on the box.  I called to have the order corrected only the be told it was the same dish.  So they refused to fix their error and then hung up on me.  Whatever you do do NOT order this dish.  It's disgusting.  Order something else, anything else.  The rest of their food is amazing, but just remember if you see a 40 something blonde waitress order your food to go.  You'll thank me for it.  She is a complete bitch.",1

"One aspect I was impressed by was the night I came here, the atmosphere of the pool hall wasn't as smokey compared to other pool halls I've been to. I'm further impressed with how clean everything is here for a pool hall, as well as all the tables & equipment seem to be in perfect condition without any wear & tear to it.\n\nThree of us played & it was about $5 a person at the end of our game, so the pricing really isn't bad at all if you're in a group & willing to split all ways. Good beer, good jukebox, the bathroom is kept clean (thank GOD, since pool halls usually have scary bathrooms depending where you go!), & an overall good time. Highly recommend for people looking to shoot some pool in the area, whether you're a pro or not.",3
"I went here with my parents when they came to visit.  Our first experience with fry bread was down in Organ Pipe Cactus National Monument several years ago, and we were looking to try more.\n\nThe chili taco was very good -- not what I expected, but who cares when it's good?  We also got cinnamon and sugar fry bread, and honey fry bread.  *nom!*  The only bad thing was it's fried (duh) so the grease factor is extremely high.  I really can't eat a taco AND share a dessert bread without getting sick.  Unless you are used to eating a lot of unhealthy foods, pick either the meal or the dessert (I'd pick the dessert!) or go with a friend and split everything to cut down on your grease factor.",3
"The show is good if you're paying less than $30 per ticket. It's a small theater so just about any seat is a \""good seat\"". The only reason I'm giving it an \""A-OK\"" is because it was cheap entertainment and my friend thought his was very attractive. Her good time gave me a good time ;-). \n\nMost of his songs are originals, but they have a good beat/tune. The band is also good as they have a few girls playing the violet, cello and double bass in addition to the drummer, electric guitars, sax, trumpet and trombone.\n\nThe few disappointments in the show was when he was promoting his champaign, a when a champaign flute \""accidentally\"" falls on stage causing a delay in the show. Another disappointment was when he had his son go on stage to preform his rap.\n\nThe show is only 60-70 mins long. I felt kind of ripped off because a sold ten of those mins was due to the broken glass on stage and his son rapping. What do you expect for the $20 per person ticket I paid, right?",2
"Was excited to see this in town as I tried them on my last trip to Florida and loved their bagels. I ordered a pumpernickel with cream cheese... the bagel was disappointing, it was very chewy and a little tough to eat, I had not tried the pumpernickel previously so not sure if that's the style of it or I had a bag bagel, there was also a TON of cream cheese on it... enough cream cheese for at least another bagel, if not maybe two... I would definitely ask for it on the side or super light next time. My friend ordered a whole wheat bagel with egg and cheese.. it was huuuuge, TON of egg on it... (cant complain). We should have shared breakfast for sure!\nI will go back and give it another try and opt for a different type of bagel, loved this place in FL!",2

Also their take out is very cute boxes that seem structurally sound for the tranport of ramen.",3
"It Hurtz Horrible. Two painful experiences in a month. On my first  the front desk persons were slow, unfriendly and grumpy. Car was filthy and when I pointed this out and requested a clean cat they offered me an upgrade for a fee. I returned car and left two phone/lap top chargers in car charger. They have not been turned over to lost and found so the staff is stealing. My second trip reaffirmed that the staff was not just having a bad day but that were bad everyday. On my return I was hurrying and did not refill gas. Drove locally around Charlotte for two days and used about 1/4 tank. I was charged $115 for a full tank and service. The mileage recorded is EXAXTLY 200 miles indicating that the just guessed an amount. HurtZ claim I returned the car completely empty but has no record or the inspection sheet. So I thought I would be helpful and do the customer survey on the hertz web site. But I needed a 5 or 7 digit access code. Three reps gave me codes that did not work. I asked the third to hold while I tried the code and he said I should call back if it did not work. http://www.hertzsurvey.com/  My exp with Hertz has been very good over many years but at Charlotte Douglas airport I will use another company, next time.

"Very Americanized; haven't tried the sushi, but why would you eat sushi at a Chinese restaurant?",1
First rate sports bar. Service is excellent. Food is very good and their house beers are scrumptious. $2.50 pints at Happy Hour. Made a fan out of me.,3
"Food good, view spectacular, decor nice, but our server, 20023 Jacinto (from my credit card reciept) needs help. Couldn't understand him much, was scarce (maybe slammed), just kept trying to sell us sides, desert and things and didn't care about us at all. Barged in our biz conversation repeatedly. At those medium--high prices, I expect more NYC like quality waiters. I hope this is read by Voodoo mngmnt and that you talk with this gent.",2
"So, we decided to enjoy Soho today, during the lunch rush, ugh! The place was very crowded, but as others mentioned the service is definitely quick, a little too quick.  We all chose different entrees, which included rice, white, brown, or fried, and a spring roll. I ordered the Chicken & Shrimp with vegetables, and fried rice. The spring roll was a little disappointing, no real filler.  As for the veggies and chicken, delish, but skimpy on the baby shrimp, will pass on that option next time. And, unfortunately I was given brown rice, or maybe it was fried, if so, not great, and on the colder side. Overall, it is a quick lunch, with good prices, but nothing stood out in my mind.",2

"I attended a networking event at The Grape last night with the Las Vegas Network for Professionals and really enjoyed the atmosphere from the low lighting, to the art and the color scheme. It really has a very cozy/quaint feel to it that I think in Vegas can often be hard to find. \n\nI had a few glasses of their Happy Hour Wine ($5 a glass!) and some toasted bread with marinara and cheese dipping sauce, it was so yummy.  \n\nI'm excited to go back and try their lunch/dinner menu, if the food and service is as good as what I experienced last night, I would move them up to 4 stars. \n\nI also have to give Glen the bartender there a shout-out, he was on top of it, informative and friendly.",2
"The perfect place for the near-east side. Good to very good drinks (depending on the bar tender) and yummy pub food -- especially the walnut burger. It has a workaday feel, with a side of liberal politics and an accepting and welcoming attitude. Somehow it's not overpopulated with posers which makes it just about my favorite place in town.",4
"First time I saw my waitress roled her eyes because I changed my side order before she placed the order on the computer..... I admited that it was my fault to change my side order but as a waitress, you should not let your customer see your attitute, missy. \nSweet potato fries was good. I really enjoyed it. If you haven't have sweet potato fries before, you should try.\nFrozen Hot Chocolate was ok. It is nothing special about it. For me, it just tasted like cold chocolate drink.\n\nps: if you dress a little bit getto, the people working here might give you a dirty look which happended to me.",2

"We went on a Friday night about 30 minutes before closing and never felt rushed, although we were the only ones in there and employees were starting to leave.  The wedding soup was good (never had it before), and the pizza had light, cruncy crust, which is how I like it.  I'll be back!",3
"So...Yelpers get a bad rap because people complain about stuff when something isn't perfect, yet they didn't try to get the situation rectified.  Here's an example of a problem and a perfect and nearly immediate solution from a franchise!  Kudos!...\n\n\nMy initial experience with Which Wich wasn't exactly awesome.  I ordered 2 sandwiches online.  You are promised an email confirmation.  I didn't get one.  No worries, 'cause the order is under my name, and I know I'll have no problem picking it up on arrival.\n\nGot to the shop, my sandwiches were ready!  Score!  Brought them back to the office and my co-worker's was perfect, just as ordered.  Mine?  I literally had nothing on it.  I ordered the tomato/avocado with a smattering of toppings and sauces.  I got bread with tomato and avocado.  Dry.  Sad.  And worst of all, no cheese!  Apparently the online ordering system has some kinks to be worked out. \n\nAnnoyed and mostly hungry, I sent a belligerent email to Which Wich about my \""shitty sandwich\"" experience. (Not proud, BTW).  Within 20 minutes, I received a phone call from Peter, the franchise owner apologizing for 1) not getting my email confirmation which would have alerted me to the ordering glitch, resulting in the incorrect order and 2) an offer to come back whenever and get my sandwich corrected, gratis.\n\nWell, I went back the next day and ordered in person (not about to try the online thing again!). The staff was friendly, didn't make me feel like a cheapass for getting a free meal, and hey, my sandwich was perfect this time!\n\nThanks, Which Wich, Peter, and your awesome staff!\n\nBonus: sign up for their emails and get some decent special offers (not all crap like some fast food email lists)",4
"The worst huevos rancheros I've ever tried to eat. Two diners near me sent their lunches back, both for being cold.I just ate a little of the rice and beans and walked out. No salsa, generic hot sauce in a squeeze bottle, a dollar if you want some chips with it. I was tempted but for the fly under the saran wrap of the next bowl in line.\n\nI've seen reviews in favor and one said it can go either way. I must have hit a bad day, too bad for me to return anytime soon.",0
"Napoletana pizza at it's finest - I would recommend ordering the Settebello pizza and sharing the Insalate Grande - Most ingredients are from Italy,  that is what sets this pizza apart from any other! Even the chefs were flown over from Italy! Thin crust and they don't slice it for you - just like in Italy- fold and enjoy! (unless you request it sliced).  This is certified Napoli Pizza - hard to find just anywhere!  The staff is attentive and happy!  They have a happy hour at the bar M-F 3-6PM $5 mini pizzas and apps. 2 for 1 drinks!  Great location - just off the 215 Fwy.",4
Feels like a small town watch repair shop.  Simple solutions to seemingly complex problems.  Refreshing.  I highly recommend.,4
Great Pizza place.  I like the thin crust but must warn you that if you order for pick up by the time you make it home it will be cold and soggy.  I had it there and enjoyed it freshly out of the oven.  The place is very nice and always busy.,3
"I came here based on Yelp reviews alone. But I'll be back on my own for sure.\nI had the Comet Classic burger based on the recommendations and it was totally worth it. Had a little kick to it (maybe in the mustard) and is topped with pimento cheese. Just enough of everything so it's not a towering burger. The fries that came with it were also really good.\nMaybe it was a $1 or $2 more than I think it should have been, but it was close enough and good enough that if a craving strikes, I'll meander back in.\nI'll also be back on a Monday night because they have $.50 wings and I couldn't get them to go. Which is fine because it looks like a great bar to hang around in.",3
"Went to Kokopelli for the first time on Sat., 3/20/10.  We had a large party and no reservation, but the hostess assured us that they could accomodate us.  We were seated in about 15 minutes - good to go.\n\nWine:  We ordered a bottle of Kokopelli's cab - and it was exactly what I was looking for - BIG, complex, etc.  Not an AMAZING wine, but very good.  (can't remember the name of it....darn.)\n\nFood:  I ordered a pork dish, that was served in medallions with some insanely good mashed potatoes and a great chipoltle sauce on the side.  I also tasted a pasta/chicken dish and a blackened salmon w/ crab meat dish from my fellow diners.  All were quite good.\n\nService:  The service was very good - especially considering how busy they were on Saturday night.\n\nOther:  They had a live jazz duo playing (guitar and double bass) and they were fantastic.  They were playing a great Santana jam, and they kept on inserting riffs from Metallica, and nobody even noticed.  (except me, I'm a musician, can't help it)\n\nSo - I'd go back to Kokopelli anytime.  4 stars.",3

"Terrible.   My only word for it.   Ran in here while in Vegas for business, and needed a quick polish change.   The man doing the manicure was doing such a poor job, I made him stop after 45 min and left.   He was going to use the same implements on me that had been used on others, but did agree to get a new emery board when I insisted.  We could hardly communicate, but he managed to express that he expected payment, even tho the existing polish had not been entirely removed.\n My nails were filed down so short, I actually had trouble picking things up for the next two days!    With SO MANY nail places around these days, how can any of them be so poor and keep their doors open?",0
"This a museum not really a pawn shop. People come in and look around to see where the show was taped. They have a ton o swag for sale and people are buying it like crazy.  The only negative is I realized the show was fake. You could see that when it is taped they clear everyone out, bring in the actors and stage the whole thing.  Ruined me for the show.",2
"First and foremost I am not here to bash the business. When I was in the Army I once heard that gun store employees come in two flavors, \""Wanna be's\"" and \""know it all's\"". And this store was no different. The staff of gun salesmen that I encountered there all looked to be about 16 years old. And every time I  asked a question the kid who was helping me either \""knew someone who had\"", \""had a police officer friend who uses\"" or \"" seen on the internet\"". Now like I said i'm by no means here to bash the business but I was not impressed by the customer service.  When I go someplace to spend money I would like knowledgable staff. After 10 minutes in the place I got the feeling I was being helped by a guy who had more time playing video games then he did behind the trigger. The gun selection consisted of their house brand AR15 which seemed to be just assembled by the store and not machined by their company. The \""tactical\"" gear they carry is all cheap foreign made low grade knock off stuff that wouldn't last 2 minutes in the military.  They didn't carry any of the 1911s I wanted, but then again after listening to the staff I realized this was just a trendy main stream gun shop. It was like a living breathing forum from AR15.com, just a bunch of rich kid wanna be's playing with their toys. I guess I should have know better considering the fact that this place has a facebook page, which was I was informed by the staff I could follow them online. And the look I received after telling the salesman I did not have a facebook reassured me I was in the presence of amateurs. Not the place to go if your an avid shooter or involved in anything more than shooting cans with your friends on weekends. However if you are, then this place might just suit you. And don't let the name fool you, there is nothing tactical about this place. When I think tactical I think Special Forces or police SWAT team this place was the last thing from anything tactical. I would be surprised to hear if any of the staff has any tactical experience away from video games. The fact that they were polite kept this from being a one star rating.",1
"I was in my Hometown for the Christmas celebration with my family. My Dad wanted to treat us to an All-You-Can-Eat Friday Night Fish Fry and gave us a couple of places that serve one. It wasn't hard for me to choose. Prairie Lanes was a place that I spent many hours at as a kid. The Bar & Grill part is all new & refurbished, so I wanted to see the new changes. Plus, I remember there not being a menu because of the limited options they had \""back in the day\"". Now, they have a full menu to offer. We made plans to all meet up at 5:30. \n\nPrairie Lanes has ample parking all around and we found plenty of spots available. They have entrances on the North, South, and smack dab in the middle of the place. The best entrance for the Bar & Grill is the middle. You will find the Bar area immediately. There is a host stand, and they will find you a table or booth. We needed a table for 7 and there was no issue with that. We got a big round one right away. Getting settled in, our server stopped by asking about drinks. I don't think anyone of us knew what we wanted. She offered waters to us all, which we accepted. When she returned with the waters, only two of us had figured out what we wanted to drink. I asked about tap beers and our server grabbed a table tent off a booth to show me. She said she would be back with the two sodas that were asked for. Most choices seemed domestic on the tap list. Our server brought the sodas and started taking our food order at this time. In all, 3 AYCE Fish Fry's, one senior Fish Fry, and two kids meals. I also ordered a High Life on tap. The Fish Fry comes standard with Beer Battered Cod, Salad Bar, Soup Bar, & choice of potato. The choice of potato is French Fries, Baby Reds, or Potato Pancakes. I went with the Pancakes. Alyssa did Baby Reds. \n\nI checked out this Soup Bar first which is right next to the Salad Bar. They offered up 3 kinds of Soup. Clam Chowder, Chicken Noodle, & Wisconsin Cheese. They also offer bowls & cups for dishing your Soup in. I grabbed a bowl of Clam Chowder and headed back to the table. Alyssa made her way up when I got back. I put a little pepper in my Chowder & dumped in the little packet of oyster crackers offered. Creamy, Hot & Fresh. But as Alyssa put it. It tastes like it came out a bag. It wasn't bad. Just....basic. I went up a second time to try the Chicken Noodle. I did a cup of it. The noodles are big and thick. The broth is flavorful. Hardly any chicken in it. Next up, Salad Bar. This is surprisingly solid. They have all the bases covered on this one. Everything was fresh & full. They had an attendant right there monitoring it. Coleslaw is available here, too.  It's something that I didn't try. \n\nI was a couple of bites into my salad when our dinners arrived. The Fish looked good. Two pieces of Golden Fried Beer Battered Cod. The Potato Pancakes not so much so. When I think of Potato Pancakes, these I didn't have in mind. They were little McDonald's like Hash Browns. Or Larger Burger King like Hash Rounds. Take your pick. Tasted like 'em, too. Straight out the freezer. Slid out the bag. Into the fryer. They tried to make them authentic by providing Applesauce & Syrup to dip them into. The Baby Reds Alyssa got were nice. They looked pan fried. The Cod Loins were cooked too much. Cutting in, they clumped instead of flaked away. Biting down, you knew it. Firm. Not tender. It's one of those thing where it's not bad, just not good. Seeming that they only offer one kind of Cod, Deep Fried. They should be able to handle cooking it the right time. Ah well. There's always the reorder, right? Those were overcooked as well. Not burned, just over done. By 2 or 3 minutes. When I mentioned this later, everyone who ordered Fish thought the same thing. I had to ask for lemon, as for that didn't come with the supper, but tartar sauce did. It tasted fine, just seemed like it came out the bottle.\n\nOur server was so very patient with us. When we were indecisive of drinks, she didn't blink an eye. She was always checking up on us. Awesome job by her. The AYCE Friday Night Fish Fry costs $11.99 here. Could be worth it, if the Cod is cooked proper. For what we got, it's a little steep. The menu here is nice. They have a burger that me, living in the Twin Cities, was surprised to see. The Juicy Lucy. While it might not be the way I'd spell it (Jucy Lucy), it sure was a welcome to see. I tried to get someone at the table to order one, to no avail. Probably a good thing. I'll take 'em out for an authentic one when they come to visit us.",2
Don't ever order the Supersonic breakfast burrito unless you like a mouthful of raw white onions first thing in the morning.  What place makes a breakfast burrito without at least heating the veggies?  Disgusting.  Wasted money since I had to throw the entire thing away.,0

"Well, I'm just arriving from the first audience & preview show of VIVA ELVIS... \n\nIn my own opinion.... what a great show!!!!!!!!!!!!! Really amazing and if this is the preview.. I can't imagine once the show becomes stronger after some time. The theater is really huge and big...the sound is one of the best things of the shows in my opinion...=) \n\nThis is a really tribute focus show on Elvis...totally, so for me it was like a journey thru his life. This is a really acrobatic show with a lot lot of dancing... I don't want to have spoilers on my comment but I do really enjoy all of them. Also this is a totally different kind of show, since is more like a tribute, there are several themes that the show has ( example the song of VIVA LAS VEGAS...) so you can imagine what are all the elements in the show when you mention LAS VEGAS.. \n\nAt the end of the show there was an standing up applause and the audience had a really nice and warm applause to the artist of VIVA ELVIS. \n\nToday I was seating in the balcony and I have to say that the view is EXCELLENT... do the fact that the theater is so big, things even in the balcony looked really great... I cant imagine tomorrow when I see the show (my original one) in the middle section at the orchestra! There are no bad seat... even the side seats have a great view.. =) \n\nThe VIVA ELVIS store was totally full after the show and I saw a lot of people buying the program \n=)... So, I can say this is going to be a great show, hopefully will also be successful as \""O\"" or LOVE...=) \n\nSo, VIVA ELVIS! \n\nPS. My suggestion is that you book by phone the tickets. Do not use Ticketmaster, is more expensive and you will get one only option of seats, if you call, MGM/MIRAGE agents are more friendly and can be flexible with seats location. Also if you book with Ticketmaster your ticket will be a Ticketmaster format, if you book by MGM/MIRAGE your ticket will be with on an Aria's photo ticket with show logo on it.",4
Terrible food. The cheapest nastiest tortillas I've ever had. And how hard is it to roll a burrito that doesn't just fall apart? Hate.,0
"I'd give this place more like 3.5 stars.\n\nLocated in a converted house in downtown Scottsdale, this easy to miss restaurant is indeed petite.  The inside had a cozy French countryside theme.  The menu was limited.  Noteworthy dishes we ordered include a foie gras starter, diver scallops served with bacon and mustard, and the souffle.  The souffle was amazing-very light with a citrus taste.  Although the onion soup was flying out of the kitchen all night, I found it just OK.  Service was good throughout the night.",2
"I haven't stayed at the Hard Rock for a year but was eager to go back. I've been pleased in the past with their friendliness and great service. Unfortunately, the service has declined dramatically. Our room in the HRH tower was very nice (none of the cleanliness issues mentioned in other posts) but that's my only positive. \n\nOur check in took 35 minutes and when we reached the window there was no apology or acknowledgement of the long wait. There were, however, lots of reminders that outside food and beverage are not allowed as my water bottle was getting the stink eye. Really? Seems rude and disrespectful. The next morning I went to the coffee shop and paid $7 for 2 coffees. There was no real sugar at the counter. When I asked the \""barista\"" for sugar, he gruffly said they didn't have any. I stood there dumbfounded. I eventually went to the diner and got my own. Later that day, I ordered a margarita with salt at the pool bar. BTW, don't expect a waitress to take your order either by the pool or while in the casino. The waitress told me that she didn't have salt for my $16 margarita. Tamara was very giving with her attitude, however.\n\nOverall, my stay was disappointing. I felt like a nuisance, not a valued guest. Oh well Hard Rock, it was fun for awhile...",1
"I was riding the light rail home, in the mood for Chinese for lunch, so I got off @ 44th st, and walked up to the CofCo Center, assuming (rightly) that there would be some restaurants in there.\nWent to Lao Ching Hing.\n\nNice decor. \nOrdered the Combo Chow Mein. It was OK, nothing spectacular. The unusual thing was the noodles were smaller than what I am used to in chow mein. It was more like spaghetini rather than spaghetti.",2
Better than Starbucks!,3
"I was excited to eat here. Looked like just my kind of place.\n\nI actually like the ambiance. Very diner/casual feel. Very homey.\n\nI would not order sushi here. The salmon was very not fresh. The tuna was not fresh. Even the cucumber sushi was not great as it was mushy.\n\nThe Tempura was pretty good although the sauce was too sweet for me. I am used to a salty/briny sauce.\n\nI would come back for Tempura. And if I ever start eating wheat and other carbs like that I would love to try the noodles. Which is why this review is not a 1 star.\n\nOh, the little salad that came with the meal was very good.",1
"0 stars please.\nThis place is the worse. There is no warmth, just about everyone who works there are rude and don't give a flying you-know-what about their JOBS. Had they cared about their food even, it would not be greasy and tasteless and buried under cheap cheese. The only thing I have been ordering these days are the nachos as that is the only thing I can tolerate, until recently. I ordered it again, with extra guacamole this time. It usually comes with it, but not enough for me. The wretched woman taking my order even asked me a second time about the guac and I acknowledged her. Lo and behold I get home to see that there is no guac at all, not a spec. How do you ask for extra and not get a thing? Simple, the idiots there that work don't give a damn. Its not worth the time or money, do yourself a favor and DONT GO.",0
"I come here to ride the rollercoaster and play the arcade games when I am in Las Vegas.  They do a good job of capturing the New York atmosphere, right down to hiring a lot of people who are apparently from New York or very good at faking the accent.  The coaster itself is a lot of fun, especially if you like vintage-feeling bumpy coasters (it feels like a wooden coaster) as opposed to super smooth rides.   \n\nGetting on the coaster is not as much fun as actually riding it because you have to rent a locker for all your stuff.  You can't just leave your glasses or cell phone or whatever on a shelf when you get on and grab it when you get off - You need to rent the locker.  Since you have to walk quite a long distance to get to the coaster after you put your stuff in the locker, it's a bit of a hassle especially if you left your glasses and can't see without them.  Also if you want to ride twice they make you go out and come in again even when there is no line.   Finally, when you leave you have to go out through a very overcrowded souvenir shop.  \n\nI like the arcade game room and again it does a pretty good job of capturing a New York amusement park vibe.  It tends to be way full of kids though since they have to have something to do other than the casino and this is one of the only options available. \n\nYou have to walk what seems to be a super long distance through the casino to get to any of this fun stuff, which is a pain.  The casino itself seems overcrowded and a bit grubby and noisy, which puts me off from actually renting a room at this establishment.",2

This place is a shadow of its former self. When it first open I was in love. I brought all my friends and a family and was a strong advocator of the great quality of meat and flavor they had to offer.Now the meat tastes like bad vons brand and the only you will taste (and continue to taste long after you leave) is salt. i love salt but i couldn't eat anymore after a while. Not because of how full I was but because my tongue hurt from all the sodium. I really thought this was a fluke because this place was it for me but alas they still suck this hard 3 times later. i guess we have to part ways Texas de Brazil. And it definitely is you not me :(,0
"I've read a lot of great reviews about this place. Now I know I've read about the sometimes long wait, which I understand for a off the strip casino for their restaurants. Tried hitting up the BBQ spot and the restaurant. Both of which had an hour wait. It doesn't seem to be too shady of a hotel as others have described. The only problem I had beside the wait was the group of emo scenesters that don't know how to drive. I will definitely try and give this place another shot next time I hit up Vegas so I can give them a real review.",0
"I felt robbed after I ate here.  The steaks were extremely overpriced. This is a real tourist trap.  They charge about double, or more the fair value of the items here.  I was terribly disappointed.   The steaks were sub par, and priced nearly $50 as I remember.   There are MUCH better places to blow your money than going here.  If you want to gamble, don't gamble by eating here.. Bet on Black, and eat at McDonald's.. You'll thank me later.\n\nThe service was incredibly bad as well.. Slow.. slow slow!  It was loud and cramped in here as well.\n\nThe high ratings surprise me.. I expected 2 or 2.5 consensus maybe at best here. I'd much rather go to CUT and spend a little more for consistently good steak than go here.",0
Good as always.  friendly staff and good food.  They let the Peoria Fire Dept. fund raise money for the 19 firefighters who just died in the fires.  This really shows how they support the local community.  This makes them top notch in my book.  Will come back in the future.,3
Love this place! Fantastic burgers! Great service! Dog friendly to boot! More detailed review to follow.,4
"The official grand opening is Nov.16 however they are taking new clients now. The pricing is great, get in now before the Founders Membership special. Decibel CrossFit has 4,800SF of space equipped with the best gear in the business and pride themselves on their 3,200 watt sound system.\nHere is an excerpt from their website:\nOne last thing:  Are your ears not getting the same quality attention as your body?  Heard that same AC/DC or Metallica song for the 10,000th time??  Due to a multitude of crimes against humanity, can't decide if NASA should send Pitbull, Nicky Minaj, and the Black Eyed Peas on a rocket to the center of the sun, or simply destroy them with lasers???  Life is too short to work out to played-out rock and lame, top 40 bubblegum pop.  We play nothing but the newest and best electro/house/dubstep/DnB/trap and modern, alternative/hard rock; the music you want to help power you through an intense WOD and sets of heavy lifts.  Did I mention our 3,200 watt ISP Technologies Pro Audio sound system?!?!?\n\nAll in all I like the gym so far. Terrell was a great guy and did a great job of explaining why this gym is different from the plethora of crossfit gyms in the valley. I didn't do a workout today but the fianc\u00e9 did and he loved they gym. He has been crossfitting at another gym in town for over a year. I plan on starting the on ramp program on the 28th which is basically a 2 week introduction. Come on and join me or just cheer me on.",4
"Left my Mexican paradise \nOn a big vehicle that flies.\nBack to Tucson and my personal fort\nBut first a stop in Charlotte's airport.\nHad a burger earlier from the Cozumel airport food crew\nSo all I really wanted was a cold and tasty brew.\nFound Bad Daddy's and enjoyed a Blue Moon\nMaybe I had two on this rainy day in June.\nWhat a great way to spend a layover, drinking and watching the World Cup.\nIf ever back this way I'll stop in again to say, Hey Bad Daddy, What's up?",3
"For the most part, FatBurger does an ok job with their food and drinks. In fact they are pretty decent about making sure that everything you get is on par with many of the other locations both in NV and Cali. \n\nFor some reason this location just misses the point! Now, I understand it is in a high volume area, with heavy foot traffic and etc. Catering to tourist who probably will not come back, but regardless of who comes into eat, Consistency & Quality is key!  \n\nMeat-overcooked\nBun-A little stale\nProduce-Not very fresh-BK & Mr. Jack-had better. \nExtra items?-Actually paid extra for something I didn't get! I know stupid me! \nOverpriced food, drinks, and etc. \n\nGo to \""In-n-Out\"" a few blocks away, if your really dying for a egg in your burger, go up the street to Fireside, I know they'll do it right! \n\nCheers.",1
"02/04/10\n\nHappy hour w/ Violeta.  Loved the furniture (dark wood and slightly reminiscent of old Mission churches or Spanish villas that one may find back home- I'm from the Philippines), and the ambience.  I liked how the doors/paneling opened up to a patio- it was a little chilly that afternoon, but I imagine that w/ the perfect weather we have now, happy hour at TLR would FEEL nice.  What I did not like about the LR is that it was NOISY.  Now, I didn't mind so much that the music selections were eclectic (country to jazz to classic rock, and even Motown); After all, we were AT The Living Room, and, as in different households, one can find different music playing.  No, it was just too noisy.  I'd hate to imagine what conversing would be like if the doors opening up to the patio were closed...  What I also noticed was that while there were smatterings of all age groups (there were even children running around in the patio!), most of the people there were in their mid-40s to mid-50s.  I usually check out happy hours at restaurants for the food offered, and not to meet potential love interests, and this venue would definitely be somewhere I'd just go for the food MYSELF.  I can't even picture being able to do some work on my laptop here... maybe it'll be different in a few months?\n\nService was a little bit lacking, but the place was packed!  A chair was even taken from our table (I didn't mind, but I think V. did, since she was keeping her fingers crossed that her hubby would join us).  As for the food, we were going to keep it light by ordering bruschetta.  (I knew that TLR was affiliated w/ Scottsdale's 5th & Wine, and I had tried and enjoyed the bruschetta there.)  The bread pieces here were sliced much thicker than those at 5th, and while they may have reminded me of Postino's bruschetta, the flavors, while good enough that I enjoyed the dish, made me wish I was at Postino's, or even at 5th & Wine.  Especially when it was so noisy we had to raise our voices to hear each other; Violeta wasn't enjoying the music; and children were running around not two feet away from me.\n\nI would like to give TLR another chance, and hopefully, my guests and I will find a younger crowd (no children present, please!) to enjoy the ambience, music, and food with.",1
"I like MADCAP. This is the type of theater I can see myself in often. I love the vintage, love the vibe, love how I feel when I'm here. I want to go more often. I may actually enjoy going to the movies again, something I really haven't done more than a couple times in probably a decade. \n\nWhat makes me sad is that I almost never hear about what is going on there. I wish they had some sort of mailing list that informed me of events because I occasionally wake up in the morning wondering why I haven't been in ages and then it's like.. yeah... because we never talk. Like the friendship you want to keep going and you have a hard time communicating for some reason. Ugh. If they have a mailing list I haven't found it. \n\nI really want to give MADCAP four stars... come on.. find a good way to promote your events and awesomeness. Make me spend my $$.",2
"I used to really like this office, and Dr. Dobrusin is a great doctor. But it's nearly impossible to get an appointment here anymore, and Dr. D doesn't work Fridays anymore, which is becoming extremely inconvenient for me because that's the only day I can get off. I think I'm going to change doctors now. There used to be a time I could call in the morning, and get an appointment that day. Not anymore.\n\nI don't like the front office staff. They are not very knowledgeable, and I think there's some language barriers. \n\nHowever, I still recommend Dr. D for newborn circumcisions. He's very experienced with them.",1
"When it's late and you want a pint and some wings, this isn't a bad spot. Granted they aren't free range organic, but better than the stuff you'll get at BWW. The place is usually empty after 1am, so the service is great.",2
Had a frustrating problem with my billing.  Spoke w/ a very NOT nice person from Atlanta I think... Was called by a local Tempe manager and it was resolved.  Thank you.,2

"For fifteen years I believed that I was not an athletic person. (Tripping over one hurdle in high school brought me to this conclusion, but that's another story). After joining Allied Crossfit  3-4 months ago I can honestly say that I was wrong. I am athletic. That's huge for me, and it says a lot about Allied Crossfit, because I believed that lie about myself for fifteen years.\n\nHere's a list of things that made me change my mind about myself.\n\n1.Gareth-He's the owner of the gym. He's also the heartbeat that pulsates throughout the facility. Gareth is motivated by a passion for Crossfit and what it stands for, and it's contagious, because he's passionate about the sport, his staff, and the membership. It motivates me and encouraged me to keep going. \n\n2.Trainers- All of the trainers are knowledgeable, observant, and encouraging. I trust the instruction they give me, and they encourage me to push myself every day. Anyone can claim the role of 'trainer' at a 'gym', that doesn't mean that you should trust them. The trainers at Allied Crossfit are not posers. They are legitimate trainers you can trust. Their expertise has made me better, and has built my confidence in my athleticism.\n\n3.Members- Everyone supports each other no matter what. You don't have to be ashamed of your fitness level. There are people of all shapes, sizes, and fitness levels in the gym. There have been a couple of days where the encouragement of the members got me through the workout.\n\nI am forever changed by Allied Crossfit, and I'm thankful for it. I could go on and on. You have to experience it to get it. Stop in, and I'll chat with you about it. If I'm not there, talk to Gareth, or the trainers, or the members. We're a friendly bunch!",4
"Not impressed.  Went here for a group lunch and ordered the Reuben.  At first bite, it was OK, but then I got a big mouthful of fat.  I opened the sandwich and the rest of the meat was so fatty, I simply could not eat it.  I mean big globs of fat and hardly any meat.  I tried cutting out the fat, but it was pretty much all there was to the meat.  Eventually I gave up, piled the meat on my plate, and ate the soggy bread.  My colleagues also commented on the fat and how little meat was actually in my sandwich.  REVOLTING.",1
"First of all, please put up pictures of your more exotic dishes at the restaurant.  Sometimes words can not describe what this dish is supposed to taste like, but pictures speak a thousand words.\n\nSecondly, the Kiwi Watermelon Lemonade is a pure stroke of genius.  You have given me an idea for a new party drink creation - KiwiWaterLemon Soju.\n\nNext, let's go on to A_____, your very defensive waiter.  I asked him to describe a \""Scramble\"" and he told me what it was.  My response was \""Oh.  Okay,  So it's kinda like a Denny's breakfast skillet.\""  He then got pretty irritated and told me that it's not anything like that.  \""And unlike Denny's, we use fresh ingredients that probably came in from California this morning.\""  Geez.  Okay.  Relax.  So I was fucking wrong.  Excuse me.  Just correct me, don't treat me like an idiot.  I should have walked out at that point.\n\nLastly, do NOT eat the \""HH Famous Meatloaf, roasted red peppers, fresh spinach and smoked mozzarella\"" (House Hash) served with eggs on a bed of crispy potatoes.  The meatloaf is tasteless, dry and gray.  There's a great biscuit, but no country gravy.  I ate the eggs and a little bit of the meatloaf, then let the rest of it rot.  This is a poorly designed dish and it should be removed from the menu.\n\nWould I come back and give Hash House A Go Go another chance?  Of course I would.  But to be fair, except for the great lemonade, my experience was pretty sub-par.  I need to be 'WOW\""ed the next time.",2
"Celebrating your 50th birthday here is ill-advised if you have a heart condition or are not ok with the randomness of the Grapevine and its Saturday night karaoke crowd.  All the sudden I look up from the birthday friend being serenaded on stage to \""Like a Virgin\"" when some meathead (rumor has it he's a stripper) starts dry humping said friend lifting her up chair and all. \n\n* Good times.  \n* Immense song list.\n* Slow drink service.\n* Kick ass bongo drums.\n* Slow karaoke service.  Took me about 90 minutes to wait for first song. (Bob Marley - Is This Love)  \n* Too many drunken \""Sweet Carolines\"" and \""Black Velvets\"".  Let's be original, people.\n* And, yes, it seems that many of the clued in regulars get to sing more often. \n* Here's a tip.  I saw the same guy sing as Joe, Joseph and Jose.  If you can't beat em?

"You want to get your dog groomed the right way - then this is the place to come!  Remember stay and support your local business.  Don't take your pooch to those large pet business chains for grooming!\n\nLocation - conveniently located in Surprise along West Bell Road opposite Walgreens, just on the corner with Reems Road.  \nThe business is located in that shopping center/strip mall on the corner behind Sonic and next to the gym/fitness center.\nLots of available parking and the business is not difficult to find with large signs and two easily identifiable entrances.\n\nAesthetics - Inside is very large - both the dog grooming area and the waiting area.  As you enter, the business is bright with soft colors on the walls, lots of windows/glass, and smells great!  \nThe last part is important because you don't want to visit a dog grooming business and it smells doggy or of anything else!  \nEven the area where the animals are groomed has lots of space for them to run about and socialize with each other!  No evidence of cramping at all!\n\nService - Only one word the sums it up - excellent!  The business is run by Margo and she's there taking calls, greeting folks as they enter, and grooming.  Very warm, welcoming, and pleasant lady!  Initially when I visited I thought it was a one-woman-show but later when I returned to pick up my dog, she had help.  Despite being busy, she is very organized and excellent with the dogs.  She doesn't shout or yell at them and was very patient.  \nShe's very accommodating in terms of timing and scheduling and was willing to accommodate my schedule.   She can usually get you in within a day and that's what she did with me - I called on Friday and was able to get an appointment on Saturday which fit my schedule perfectly.  \nPrices are affordable for a grooming which includes everything from teeth cleaning, nail clipping, to hair cut, etc. and you can tell what you want and what you would like to omit.  There's even a 10% discount for new customers.  \nEach dog is individually cared for and not treated like a conveyor line production like you might find at some of the large pet chains.  \nI have been going to many dog groomers and usually my dog will come back with some kind of problem, e.g. an allergy to the shampoos used but this wasn't the case with Margo.  My dog returned home happy and healthy without any problems!\n\n\nRating - 5/5 stars!  Definitely will be returning and have already scheduled my 8-week follow up appointment!",4

"This was a nice option for a restaurant that doesn't scream \""Vegas\"". Our party of four stopped by after an event without reservations on a Sunday night and 10 minutes later we were seated on the patio with a nice view of all the guys handing out escort cards. Besides the \""view\"", good food for what I had. I wasn't feeling a large meal so I ordered the tomato and mozzarella salad, crab cake, and split calamari. Our table split a bottle of wine. \n\nAs someone else mentioned, the rolls are amazing. The calamari was very good, as was their tarter sauce seasoning. It did bother me the calamari didn't come with a lemon, so we had to ask for one, and the dish was a bit cold by the time we got our garnish. The crab cake was good, and expensive (I believe about $13 for one crab cake), but nothing to write home to my Maryland peeps about. The mozzarella and tomato salad was very good! Huge slices of tomato and generous portions of fresh mozzarella...very good!\n\nA great stop-in place in Vegas without the hassle of a big name, star chef restaurant. Prepare to drop some dough for a full meal.",3
Meh....I could have lived without having to experiencing this place. Food was alright and the service wasn't the greatest.  (And not in the New York kind of way...just not available)  I could have spent $20 on breakfast somewhere else.,2
Awesome custard and burgers.  Nothing says greasy happiness like cheese curds.  They do it right considering they are a big chain..,3
It was absolutely disgusting. I think I had the bulgogi burger and it was covered in this gelatinous muck. The garlic parm fries were covered in salt and over cooked. The guys there seemed nice but I will not be returning!,0
"The question, of course, is: What do you order at a place named U.S. Egg? A hamburger, right? Right.  In doing so, you'll get to devour one of the best burgers to be found in downtown Scottsdale.\n\nThe second version of this two-store operation (the first is in Tempe) offers terrific breakfast and lunch grub at reasonable prices. I've had the eggs and all that. They're good, too. And, I suspect, most people come for breakfast rather than lunch. But if you're steering your car into the neighboring Red Lobster or Olive Garden, or, for goodness sake, Denny's to stuff yourself full of corporate crap, stop. Do yourself a favor and pull into the U.S. Egg. Or do other people a favor and park in the Red Lobster/Olive Garden lot and go to U.S. Egg. Perhaps the lot will, with your help, fill up and terrible eating disasters will be avoided.\n\nAnyway, U.S. Egg has burgers, sandwiches, eggs, pancakes and all that stuff. They're open everyday until 2:30 p.m. Seating was speedy as was the friendly, helpful service during our visit. The atmosphere is mellow and the two-seat booths offer a coziness not found at other joints. It's easy to overlook this place, for whatever reason. Stick it in the back of your mind and try it out someday. I think you'll be happy you did.\n\n* You'll find the menu, hours, addresses and other such information on the website.",4
"They were closed from 2-5, What the Hell!!!! Trek all that way from Mirage and you're closed! What kind of Vegas stop are you!",1

"I fell in love with this place at the Mesa location but I haven't been impressed with this one. First of all, they have all 16 year old kids working there. Now, they're nice enough, but frankly they're slow and all they do is socialize. After the 15 minutes it takes them to put some ice and syrup in a cup, I often realize that it's not even the correct order. Still decently priced and good tasting ( except the passion fruit syrup-- that's nasty) but lots to be desired service wise. Where's the management?",2
"As far as diners go I'm not that impressed.\nThe pancakes are unique but nothing else is worth trying in my opinion. I gave this place a few tries and while I know it isn't supposed to blow my socks off, I would say that the prices are a bit high for what they're serving. \n\nThe service there is nice and pretty fast. That's all I got.",2
"A total dive, but worth it. Service is good and the Pho is authentic.",2
"I have a medium sized cockapoo that I used to take to Petsmart to get groomed. I was never happy with their service - they would give him the atrocious poodle cute even when I specifically asked not to and I noticed sometimes his breath was still smelly even though teeth brushing was in the package. He was also deathly afraid every time we went to the stark white room in the back of Petsmart.\n\nI was SO happy to have discovered Malinda's. Not only was it much less expensive, they service was amazing! My dog came out looking adorable, following the exact instructions I gave them. He was clean, smelled fresh and even fresh breath. The groomer also found a tiny weed lodged deep in his paw and took the time to tell me how to check for things like that. The place also looked adorable and front desk service is friendly as well. Arthur and I are so glad to have found a new groomer!",4
Very friendly staff. Great food. The girl at the register also took the time to work with us on our order so we got the best fit for our family at the cheapest price. Great service!,4
"Apparently the new owner has trouble keeping employees.  The cook had not shown up in two days so the owner (who is not a cook) was cooking.  The server made it obvious to us that she did not like the owner or her ability to cook.   Service was not good, food was ...ok. Was charged extra for fries with sandwich instead of potato salad, but server never mentioned it was a dollar more.  That info was hidden in the tiny fine print on a different page of the menu from the sandwiches.  The bathroom was even dirty so I guess the dishwasher quit too. \n\nDisappointed in the total down grade of the place.",0
"I hate to give bad reviews but it was slow inside yet still service took forever because the pick up n to-go orders didn't stop. Only one lady there, poor thing. We were there for 2 1/2 hours way too long. Pulled pork was yummy and brisket as well. Not a fan of ribs... Fatty, dry and tough. Hot BBQ sauce had 0 kick. Cold corn and definitely not my momma black eye peas and rice :(. Still in search of a great bbq spot in Vegas. Any ideas?",1
"Stopped into this new location today for a pair of their Rugged Exposure Journey Plus walking shoes.  I've been buying shoes at Big 5 for many years & have always done well with them...  This variety, for example, are comfortable right from the start & last me a couple of years.  That's better performance for $20 than I get from Florsheim's that cost $100!     :-))",4
"This was the singularly worst meal and dining experience I have had in a very long time.\n\nThe menu promises there will be a great meal here. The actual experience is extremely different. We ordered our meals and waited an hour for them to arrive. Our waiter was absent during this time. When our meals arrived via a different waiter the food was all lukewarm. My chile relleno was so small and unrecognizable I thought they forgot it. It consisted of small flat piece of pepper covered with a tasteless sauce and some sort of cheese. The tamale was cold, filled with unseasoned ground beef and quite tasteless itself.  We never received our check until we stood up to leave. Then our waiter magically materialized, for the first time since taking our order over an hour earlier. \n\nTry any other Mexican restaurant, even Taco Bell, before going here.",0
"Myself, my husband and my son came in for happy hour on a Thursday afternoon. It was a quiet day in the 808 so we were told to just grab a seat wherever. We sat at a table for 4. We ordered our food and my brothers' food who was to join us. Not too long after the food arrived my brother showed up along with our friend (unbeknownst to us). Naturally we all want to sit together, so, my husband grabs a chair from an empty table behind us for our friend. As soon as that happened the waitress rushes over to us and says that we can't do that so I told her ok than can we move to the table next to us that was a table for 6. And she tells us we can't do that either, she says in order to be sat together we would have to arrive together..WTH!!..mind you it just us and couple that was dining at the time. So, explain to me what the issue is here? My brother left along with our friend. Of course I'm confused of what just happened and wanted an explanation. To make a long story short she said it's Dean's policy (the owner) cuz there's been numerous complaints blah blah blah and that they are trying to figure out blah blah blah...really right now, save it, if you're still trying to figure $#!+ out on how to run things in the dining area than use your better judgment or your own discretion on on certain issues...like I said it was a slow day in the 808... \n\nbtw...get your knives sharpened or somethin cuz there's gotta be something wrong when you pick up one sushi and the whole roll is still connected....sushi gone wrong! \n\nYeah, such a shame to call such a place 808 when there's no ALOHA spirit or service! \n\n1 1/2 ago I raved about this place and would rate it 5stars...NOW if You ask me today I would rate this place ZERO stars but I have to rate at least 1 star to post my review.\n\nJust so you know we were here 2 weeks prior to this incident with disservice and today we decided to give it another chance...and it has gotten to this point. Done with the 808.",0
Great pest control company! They're always on time and I've had the same guy spraying my house for years now.,4
"It's alright.. Not bad but not awesome!\nAYCE could be a little better. Kalbi ribs looked like some mini leftovers and I barely got any meat to get a true itdea what I'm eating. You can only order that item once, the came some Japanese Steak and It was some ground beef with teriyaki.. Wth is that? The sushi is decent but not like damn yo!! I travel for a living and try out a lot of sushi and this place is Aightt. I may visit again but not anytime soon.. I'll try the bento and give them a second chance.",2
The room is very spacious and nice HOWEVER we found bugs right next to our bed probly anywhere between 15-20 small bugs. We investigated more and found two spider webbs and a dirty towel in a drawer. The lady at the front desk nicole was very sweet about got us a new room and a $50 credit to there resturant. When we got our new room there was a leak from the codensation :/ wont be coming back!,1
"My wife and I ate some food from here for take-out, we werent impressed.  OK, but I wouldn't order from here again. I'm not sure why it got such high reviews, we just moved here and this is the first Chinese place we've been to so maybe this is good for the area, I don't know. The entrees were reasonably priced, but the appetizers were overpriced.  $5-6 for crab puffs is way too much. My biggest complaint about the food is that in the Kung Pao Chicken we ordered the chicken wasn't the breaded and fried variety typical of american style Chinese food, and sauce wasn't very flavorful.  Maybe they are trying to be more authentic with the chicken, but the rest of the dish was your typical americanized Chinese, so there was a mismatch there.",1
Mmmmmm! I love their breakfast burrito! Although I cannot finish it because of it's mammoth size I will return again and again. Don't forget to order some Gac+Chips! THE BEST!,4
"Great food, always fresh love to come in and eat with the family\nthey have great breakfast lunch and dinner, sea food is always fresh and the people are great and have the best lunch specials.  Food is unique",4
"I guess I should have known that this place would suck, because it is inside of the Excalibur, but I didn't use my common sense. $22 for a White Russian, a Heineken, and a Coors Light? Come on. I mean, I guess it's strip prices, but YUCK! I'm used to my California dive bars, not this. I tried to tell my pals that we should go to one of the GREAT video poker lounges around town and get hammered for under $20 a piece, but nooo, they wanted Dicks. Alright. I mean, the bartenders didn't even harass us, and for a Thursday night at midnight it was empty. There were two people dancing to the bad cover band.\n\nI guess it's fun for some folks, but not for me.",0
"I've passed by this place several times and wondered about it- exterior was interesting enough to catch my eye. Place actually had the fee of an older steakhouse. Service was decent. All of the food I tasted was excellent- fried octopus, a water melon salad, and samples from two different cuts of steak. Steak was actually amazing. Beer selection was reasonable but not extravagant...better than average bar of course. Lighting was a little dark..seems like a good place to take your family (parents I mean, didn't really seem geared towards families with children). Business casual dress at least.",3
"Enjoyable fresh flavors with crispy fresh chips, relaxed atmosphere and nice friendly bar.",3
"Granted the set pieces are dated, and the songs are Classic Hollywood, but this is what I love! \n\nWhat made this show extra interesting to me is the backstage tour I took before attending the show. Julie, our showgirl tour guide, was very informative, and friendly. It was absolutely fascinating to see the costumes, headdresses, back packs, jewelry, props, sets, etc. To learn about the stage and how they move the scenery around, and deal with quick costume changes, plus how often everyone has to audition. \n\nHaving this knowledge in my backpocket really enhanced my appreciation of the show. It also didn't hurt that I got a free seat upgrade when the usher took one look at my seat location and said that my view may be blocked. And, if it was, to come back and see him and he would move me. Well, it was blocked, and he did move me. Score!\n\nWithout the tour, I'd probably have given 3 stars, but with the tour, I've bumped my score up to 4 stars. And, contrary to other big ticket showroom shows, there's no drink minimum.\n\nI completely agree, however, that the men are spectacularly lackluster.",3
"Worst Embassy Suites Ive been to in my life. They need to remodel the rooms, it doesnt feel like a hotel at all it feels like im in a cheap motel. Shuttle was 30 mins late and the breakfast opened so late. It says they open at 6am and we waited till 6:45 but they havent served the food yet, so we just left to catch up for our flight after wasting almost an hour of waiting for the food... Worst hotel ever! Dont be fooled by the name, my family and i love Embassy suites  but this one is just awfully bad.  Not worth staying at all, id rather go to hyatt or renaissance just next door next time Im here.",0
"Just like all the other Firehouse subs that I've been to.  They make great subs, much better than Subway.  Service was fast here, even with a group of 15.",2
"This place really needs some pointers on customer service. The front desk, Claire, was rude and didn't even acknowledge me or give any type of instructions when I walked in. I waited because she was helping another patient. When she finishes, she STILL doesn't say anything, doesn't even look up, and makes a phone call. Then this guy walks right in, goes in front of me, signs in, and he obviously sees me standing there. Then when I say something he continues to sign in before me. There is absolutely no privacy at all. The staff discuss the patients information all at the front desk and they are very disorganized. I asked for an estimate of how long I'd be waiting and all Claire says is \""there's three people ahead of you\"" and then I get called 1 minute after. Really?? I got called up for my information more than once. There is no communication between staff members and they talk down to each other in front of the patients. Overall, if you could choose another location, I would.",0
"Came here for lunch because the kiddos wanted to hang out and feed the ducks. My husband and approaches the hostess stand and was rudely told by Robin that they were not seating any one outside. We talked it over for a bit and the kids really wanted to stay. I re-approached the hostess and she asked if we wanted to sit by the window. I said yes and she reiterated that no one could sit outside. I laughed it off and made a comment about the kids wanting to be outside to play. She said (very curtly), \""Well, this IS a restaurant and kids can't just run around.\"" I laughed and told her that we would be dining elsewhere. My kids had been standing there quietly the entire time - no running, no yelling and no fits. I guess she had to assert herself and put us in our place. I'm not sure why they have the ducks and allow kids to feed them if they don't want kids playing outside. My husband then asked her for her name and her supervisors contact information. She told us she was in charge - we asked her if she was the owner of the restaurant (to which she answered \""no\""). We then requested this individuals contact information. She reluctantly have us an email address. She then told my husband \""well, what should I have said to your wife?\""  At this point we disengaged with her and left. We headed down the road to the Buffalo Chip Saloon and had excellent service. \n\nThis was the straw that broke the camels back - the food was mediocre and this type of service is abhorrent. If my children are misbehaving then feel free to tell me something but don't provide me with preemptive and unsolicited parenting advice. This place is definitely off of our list of places to eat. We will use our hard earned money to patronize establishments with staff that knows how to treat its customers.",0
"I had high hopes for this place and really wanted to love it since it seems like the only boba place in Henderson. I got 2 avocado smoothies for me and my friend...as soon as I took my first sip, I said to my friend, it's not as good as the one in Chinatown. I'm not sure if they used less avocado in their smoothies or if the avocado that day was just not as ripe? Either way, I haven't tried it again since. Maybe I will give it another try. However, I will say that the service was friendly.",2
"My opinion may be a bit biased because we were given near VIP treatment for our first time there.  Thanks to Herman N. we were placed on the guest list (funny story if you want to inquire).  We didn't think too much of it, as we thought we'd be able to just stand in a different line and pay the normal cover charge.  I was wrong.  The night we were there, there was a long line to get in.  The club was relatively new at the time.  Our guest list privilege allowed us to not only skip the line completely, but to get in for free.  Crowd was fun and the layout was nice.  The outdoor area with the waterfall was a nice touch.",3
"If you don't like having smooth, relaxing craps, and pleasure yourself in hot, anus ripping diarrhea, then look no further- Basha on Sherbrooke and University is the place for you!\n\nThis lovely little toilet nightmare is placed in the basement suite of an old, semi-abandoned office building, sharing its prime real estate with a shady currency exchange store that opens for only 3 hours a day and a Tim Hortons above it that, for lack of a better word, is as pleasurable in dining as is eating the asshole an obese computer technician named Fred.  The decor in this Basha's is lovely:  it features crumbling drywall, piss yellow cracked paint, and an orange trim that is peppered with cigarette burns and ashes from the staff after working hours.  The floor is also missing a few tiles and it's been mopped with outdated cleaning products from the 50's that smell like ass-juice vinaigrette.  The decor and ambiance of a Middle Eastern building in the midst of a warring conflict is achieved in all 5 senses...truly a design award is necessary for this place.\n\nThe food is affordable...some would even argue cheap as hell.  And hell it does seem to exemplify once tasting it.  The hummus is about 5 days old and unrefrigerated, giving it an extra bit of sour mold to for a reduction in taste, while the kebab meats are uncooked, still dripping fresh in its juices when killed when served to you coupled with vegetables from Lobo.  If you're lucky enough, this delicious meal will also include an extra bonus of a piece of fur or bone from the mystery meat you adventurously embark on tasting.  This is truly a wonderful spoof at the poverty some must undergo in the slums of war torn countries and the owners do an excellent job simulating poverty's finest dishes to an elite group of college students.  Truly, this ploy of forcing empathy through taste is a great charitable cause and is noteworthy in decor, ambiance and especially in inducing you to excretion levels so high that your bowels and esophagus will be taken to unseen heights.",0
"We used a groupon to check this place out. Despite having a pleasant sever, the service was poor. We ordered the dumplings (delicious), spring roll (not tasty at all. Probably the worst i have ever had), and chicken and steak hibachi (very salty). I can't say I will be back any time soon. It was just okay for us.",1
Good eating buffet: After eating a few soso buffets we found this place to be really good for the price. Me and my lady really enjoyed most all of the food on it. i had the prime rib and it was rare & tasty the way ilike it. My girl had the salmon and truly enjoyed it. We both liked the desserts also but didn't have a lot of room the tummy to eat. This place was very clean and all the wait staff was very friendly. I highly suggest this buffet as we would go back again.,3
"Damn you, Priceline!\n\nDon't get me wrong, I love a good Priceline deal.  Most hotels I found through Priceline have been cheap and better than expected.    However, in this case, my experience was a big fat disappointment.  It is partially my fault, because I failed to read the disclaimers.  You see, about 12 months ago, Priceline changed their hotel \""zones\"" from \""North Strip\"" to \""North Strip & Vicinity\"" and from \""South Strip\"" to \""South Strip & Vicinity.\""  Oh boy.\n\nThe last two times I was in Vegas (Final Four Weekend and Kentucky Derby Weekend), I was unfortunate enough to have been relegated to the \""vicinity.\""  I am talking about Hooters Hotel and Casino, formerly known as San Remo Hotel.  The Hootel, as I like to call it, is located just behind Tropicana and just across the street from MGM Grand.  The location is really not that bad.  Besides, I only paid $69/night, which my friends found to be hilarious in itself.\n\nHowever, was it a good value?  NO!!!!\n\nThe Hootel is worse than you can imagine.  Only one of the two elevators in our tower worked.  The Hootel seemed to have a shortage of hand towels and regular sized towels.  When we called housekeeping, they promptly brought us more bath towels.  Hmmm.  The towels weren't even all that white.  Hmmm again.  The latch on my balcony door wasn't working.  Hmmm one more time.  The walls are paper thin, so you can hear a lot of what's going on in the adjacent rooms.  Hmmm and shrug.  We stayed on a non-smoking floor, but the \""no smoking\"" designation must have included tobacco only, because the distinct smell of marijuana emanated from the hallway (I am talking to you, obnoxious guests in Room 1008).  Hmmm and sniff-sniff.\n\nThe room itself is a sight to see.  It's not your average Zach and Cody's suite at the Tipton Hotel.  It's more like Hannah Montana's after-school Malibu hangout . . .  if she and her friends wore orange shorts and served you beer and chicken wings.  (OK, even I don't know where this analogy came from).\n\nHave you ever dreamed of having your own Hooters Restaurant in your house, without the women or chicken wings?  Well, your fantasy is realized right here, in your very own Hooters hotel room.  Your room decor will feature tables and backboards made of unfinished wood, bright orange lampshades, a painting of a Hooters restaurant on the wall, a fake palm tree, and ... an orange bar stool and a bar table right in your room!!!  Score!\n\nUnfortunately, no amount of orange decorations could make up for the white trash appeal of this hotel.  The clientele of this Hootel is unbelievably white trash.  Never in my life have I seen so many Harley Davidson and Lynyrd Skynyrd t-shirts on a casino floor.  Every group of frat boys checking in had a case of Pabst Blue Ribbon or Bud in tow.  Women had questionable tattoos and wore Daisy Duke shorts.  Casino featured neon lights and an original Alan Kulwicki's NASCAR vehicle.  I kept hearing Jeff Foxworthy's \""You might be a redneck if . . . \"" routine in my head.  'Nuff said.\n\nI love a good bargain, but this isn't it.  Do yourself a favor and spend the extra $10-30 a night on a real hotel room.  I am never staying here again, EVER.",0
Wow...I wanted to like this place...It is ascetically pleasing but thats about it...We went for drinks on a Sunday night as I had some friends in from out of town...Weak watered down over priced drinks...The bartender informed me to order a double as it would be a better deal..So I do...and what does this guy do...pours the exact same amount of liquor in my drink than the previous one that was a single... What a dickhead the bartender was...Watching him awkwardly dance to shitty house music was about his only redeeming quality...Also our drink prices changed depending on who went up to order...Good luck casa...I don't know what kind of demographic you think your serving...You can't charge Scottsdale prices on Mill and last...,0
"Oh I want to rate this one higher than I think it deserves so badly!  Having been in Las Vegas since I was a wee little one, Macayo's was a household name.  We used to get their chips and salsa as a special treat and bring the chips home in s poet bag and the smooth salsa in a styrofoam coffee cup!\n\nI still enjoy to this day their chips and salsa. The TCT is always a great appetizer as well. However, I'm saddened to say that overall, their food sucks.  I have tried a large portion of things on the menu at one time or another and 90% of it is nothing special at all.  This is a terrible reality for me as I want to say it's great.  After being served what looked like a bowl of vomit today aka Chicken Chiliorio, I had to write the review.  This sounded so tasty on the menu but comes out so awful looking and tasting I had to end lunch without eating it.  Fortunately, the great service which is typical of Macayo's staff took it off the check.  \n\nGood things:  chips and salsa & TCT\nMediocre at best:  everything else I have tried. \n\nI wish I could find a better place that hit the spot on both the chips and salsa and the main course. Those are hard to find a good balance of.  \n\nThree stars if you're selective on what you eat",2
"I got a take out order from them on Saturday morning right as the opened, I have been training for the past 3 months for a fitness competition, once I competed for some reason all I was craving was Belgian waffles!  My waffle was the biggest disappointment ever.  It was rubbery, and had no fluff to it, it actually seemed like they just took pancake mix and attempted to make a waffle out of it.  It wasn't crispy at all, and not because it was in a take out container, we live maybe 2mins from the establishment, it was never crispy to begin with.  On top of it just being poor in taste and texture it looked horrible, burnt edges and they didn't even bother to clean off the over spill edges which is that parts that were burnt. \n\nIt tasted like they hadn't cleaned the waffle iron in some time.  There was s distinct taste of charred waffles that had been their before.  This was my first experience here and my absolute last.",0
"More expensive than it should be, but they have very good carne asada, and the only authentic el pastor I've found in Phoenix (cooked on a gyro rotisserie with a pineapple on top). Definitely the most authentic taqueria near ASU. The el pastor taco special on Tuesdays is my favorite.",3

"The bagels are okay, some are actually tasty.\n\nThe \""schmear\"" (flavored cream cheese) is way too sweat for me.\n\nThe coffee is some of the worst I've ever drank.  Extremely watery, even the dark roast, tainted with stale flavors, and too expensive.\n\nTheir sandwiches are overpriced; thin toppings and not very satisfying.\n\nAnd if it looks like you are walking towards UNLV, your car might get towed by the property owners (although I haven't seen this happen lately).\n\nThey like to put \""Darn Good\"" on everything but I just say \""Darn\"".",1
"One of the best views in town... and the food is marvelous... (tip go early... like 5:30 when they open and you can get a table by the window....) I usually just show up as they open, have a martini and a couple of appetizers... what a lovely light meal in a beautiful location...",4
We tried this place a couple of times and really like the food.  Drinks are okay and small though.\nRecommendations: Guacamole and Fajitas - we found these to be really good dishes,3
"We had spent the afternoon out in the hot sun and hadn't eaten all day. I'm the kind of girl that needs to eat every two hours or I grow a second head and start screaming about any minuscule thing that happens to set me off. Needless to say, I needed to eat before someone got hurt. \n\nWe had been wanting to try North End Pizza for awhile; so when I felt like devouring 56 slices of saucy cheesey goodness after my day in the sun we decided to finally make the stop. \n\nNo debating for me over what to order. Margherita special for the day? Yes, in a large please. And a side of fries. \n\nThe fries weren't great, weren't bad. I dumped some garlic salt on them and they instantly improved. They brought out the pizza and I was a little disappointed- it was a bit skimpy on the cheese. \n\nAfter my first slice I was hooked. The crust is thin but not super thin, the sauce has a lot of flavor, and the mozzarella (what there was of it) was fresh. My husband and I ate the entire large pizza right then and there.",3
"I feel rather sheepish writing this update. I was very impressed with my nurse, Sheila, who had year of experience and new ideas about what to do with drooping corners of my mouth and eyes. \n\nAfter ten days, there is improvement, but not what I was hoping for. I am disappointed. I had always gone to a dermatologist for Botox or other fillers and always got the results I was expecting.\n\n\nMy husband also had Sheila use Botox on his prominent forehead lines, lines between the eyes, and crows feet. His forehead shows definite improvement, though one line is still quite noticeable, only one side of his crows feet are better, but the lines between his eyes are as deep as ever. He is very disappointed and refuses to use Voci Spa again.\n\nI am wondering about the quality of the Botox used, how fresh it is, if it is indeed what is used in a dermatologist's office, or if it has had other ingredients added to it. The price was $10 per unit, which is about right, though many places charge $12.\n\nI still think Sheila is great at knowing where and what to inject, but if management's policy is to use a less effective product, then expertise can't possibly make up the difference. \n\nI doubt I will return to Voci myself. Like my husband, I'll be looking for a derm's office who specializes in injectables. I am sorry I had to write this second review after my initial enthusiasm and hopefulness.",0

"My parents live down road and we were in town visiting them, I decided to look on Yelp for something new and different to take them for dinner. We got sat right down with very friendly service. I love older authentic home style places like this. The menu has lots of different offerings with some great choices. They serve warm chips and a couple kinds of salsas and dips (and Hot !). We all got a vast array of choices and the portions were good and tasted great. Everyone told me great choice on picking a new place and I said its all about Yelp! . They checked on us numerous times and kept the drinks full without asking . We always have gone to the other place in town but decided to change and we are very glad we did, If we lived in town we would eat here regularly !",3
"Amazing food. I could care less about decor and all that stuff, they clearly invest where it counts! I got the basil fried rice, extra spicy, and subbed fried tofu. The waitress was extremely friendly and my tea never got under 3/4 full. They use jasmine in their iced tea, which gave it a fresh taste that was amazing! The fried rice had fresh tomato, cucumber, carrots, and basil. I love how they left the veggies fresh and didn't stir fry them into the fried rice. The veggies were sooo fresh, I've never had fried rice with such fresh veggies. The fried rice was extra spicy, just like I asked. Best authentic Thai food in town. If you're a stuck up snob who cares about decor, order it to go or go to some hip new Japanese fusion restaurant in town with mediocre food. If you like good food, eat here. Veggie/vegan friendly also, they even asked me \""no fish sauce/chicken broth/egg etc before I even placed my order. I wish I could 10 star this place.",4
"Mal wieder im B\u00f6ckeler gefr\u00fchst\u00fcckt und leider hat sich das Management wieder etwas einfallen lassen, um die Kunden zu \u00e4rgern. \nAb sofort kostet die Toilette (gesetzlich geregelt, dass diese f\u00fcr G\u00e4ste gratis sein muss) EUR 0,50. Diese bekommt man mit der Rechnung verrechnet. Das bedeutet allerdings im Umkehrschluss, dass man nach dem Bezahlen (also auf dem Weg zur Garderobe oder eben wenn man geht) die EUR 0,50 einfordern muss, wenn man dies nicht gerade bei dem Kellner macht, der einen bedient hat. Auch muss man ab sofort immer genug Kleingeld dabei haben, will man nicht beim Personal Pinkeleuros wechseln. \n\nSorry, aber das ging die letzten 200 Jahre auch. F\u00fcr mich befindet sich ein Traditionscaf\u00e9 auf dem besten Weg in die Systemgastronomie. \n\nWeiter Punkt, der mich massiv \u00e4rgert ist die Tatsache, dass man hier immer noch nicht mit Karte zahlen kann. Wenn man mit Bekannten zum brunchen kommt, muss man sich ordentlich mit Cash eindecken, will man diese einladen. Hier h\u00e4tte ich mich gew\u00fcnscht, dass die Investitionen der Pinkelschranke, in ein ec-Terminal gesteckt worden w\u00e4ren.\n\nDas Problem mit der Eistheke hat sich im \u00fcbrigen f\u00fcr den Winter erledigt, daf\u00fcr besteht das gleiche Problem nun bei der Stra\u00dfentheke f\u00fcr Backwaren.

"Saw great reviews on Yelp, so I gave it a try despite 40 min drive from my house. Doctor was perfect: thorough, kind, patient and informative. Unfortunately the people working in the office/front desk needs more training in professionalism and efficiency. Nice ladies, but not the brightest of every age group. Yes, I saw at least five people working the floor. And yet.. Spent about 30 minutes with the doctor, 15 min picking out contacts, and another 2 hours of waiting to get contact order submitted, price estimated, and purchase a very expansive $250 frame that a week later went on sale for 60 percent off. I'll find another clinic nearer.",2
So I went to a Mum & Baby/Toddler group here on a Friday last week....it was OK. I think a lot better for when your wee bairn perhaps hits the 2+ age bracket and they're racing around but if you're bringing a wee baby along it's unfortunately not practical enough. There's no real cordoned off area for people bringing small babies along like there is at St Paul's & St George's. You have the kids racing past you as you're trying to feed or even smacking into their car seat whilst they're sat in it. I think the mum and baby groups are a great idea and lifesaver for those of us who wish to get out and meet people but unless they change it I don't think I'll be going back again. Not for a couple of years at lease. I feel horrible writing this because I know they're setting it up off the back of the donations you give but for the age group my child is at (5 months) there are other places more suitable...,2
"I'm not really sure why the rating on this place is so low--we had a really great experience. Granted, we had zero waiting and the attendant got us in and out quickly.\n\nWe chose a moderate-sized vehicle and they told us to pick one out that we liked best, which we did. All in all, it was a great experience. The only reason for the four-stars is that our attendant wasn't very personable or overly polite, but that's being really nit-pickety. \n\nOne thing to note about ALL rental calls for Phoenix Sky Harbor International is that they are located off-site in one main area. It's a really quick shuttle ride (3 minutes?) and they really keep you moving both from the airport and back again. We LOVED the shuttle drivers!",3
"As I've said previously, I love Sacks and their sandwiches. Compared to the downtown version, this location is nice. The parking is a little confusing, since it is shared with another restaurant, but at least there is plenty of parking! Both outside and inside are pretty cool. I've always called ahead and had my order ready and waiting to be devoured. For such a delicious sandwich, the price is great. My fav is the Symphony - turkey, avocado, and bacon on wheat. Perfection. The employees are really nice as well. I like that I can get in and out quickly at this location (compared to the downtown location). I just wish there was a Sack's closer to home!",3
"I don't really go for nice hotels (as long as there's a bed & a shower I'm happy), but my papi decided he would take me here for a night for the experience. He chose this because this hotel is... Caesar's Palace! Caesar lived here! Of course we'd love to experience this, too.\n\nChecking in took forever. We were unaware that you can check in thru text 24 hrs prior to your check in day, so we didn't do that. It took 45 mins before we can have our room keys and the bellhop to take our bags to the room. And so we enter the room... \n\nIt was nice! I loved it! There's a bed, a purple couch... Ooops. The couch has a stain. We check out the bathroom. A tv in the mirror too! Just like the Flamingo! And the spa tub? None. The view? The strip... If not for the Colosseum blocking it. The comforter looked dusty-white, and the hidden part of it under the pillows were white-white. I wonder when they last washed these linen! Papi got confused. Our room should come with a spa tub and all the works. So he called guest services. \n\nThey said we can either stay in this room and we will be given a $50 credit towards food and beverage, or move to our new room. We asked if we can get a credit towards gaming instead. No, they can't do that. So we decide to move to another room instead because we have the Buffet of Buffets and we don't need their f'n food credit, our faces are already stuffed. And we have to use it within our visit. \n\n48 years later, our bellhop has not arrived yet. We came in at this hotel at 1pm, and it is now 3pm.\n\nSo... We FINALLY went to our new room. I know this hotel have different towers but this ours was just a freaking far walk! But, when I got in the new room, voila!!! It's twice the size of the other room! The bathroom is the size of our apartment living room. You can actually put a couch in there and a love seat and there will still be room for our flat screen... and the spa tub! No stains on the couches this time... And our view was the pool... or should I say pools. Pools of glory. Super fancy!\n\nBut.\nI would not have stayed here if not for the deal my husband found. I would come back to say hi to Caesar and maybe to try the Qua Spa (good reviews), but not to book a room. \n\nUnless somebody else pays for it.",1
"Just got back from a four day stay. Last year at this time I stayed at Luxor. I'm glad this time I did not.  I found the Hotel to be well maintained. The staff were delightfully friendly and well informed. Housekeeping was thorough and courteous. Yes, I was there for EDC weekend. No, I'm not 18 years old. I am a fifty year old business man who enjoys EDM . I found that Elara seemed to have a great handle on both. Never did I witness the disrespect that I had at other hotels for the younger crowd, ( Who also spend their hard earned money.) Yet, they also seemed to please the older crowd who were not there for the event. I love when a company understands and plans for these occurances as Elara seems to have. I truly felt welcomed... Great choice. Couldn't have been happier ... and a great price.",4
What a great place.  A little expensive but well worth it.  Staff is Awesome and food perfect,4
"I saw a stylist at the Chandler store.  I took pictures in of  how I wore my hair during the summer.  I wanted that style and she said she could do it.  It was an elegant hairstyle, about four inches long.  My hair is now about an inch long around my face, less in many places, and about two inches everywhere else.  I did not get anything near the style I showed her.  I really look like someone put a bowl on my head and cut it.  It is an awful style for me.  And I did not even ask for a new style!  I do not know why stylists feel they must do something different even when they say they will not.   If they can't do something you are asking for, they should say so and I would go elsewhere.   This stylist was recommended by friends and when I saw them last night they wanted to know why I didn't go to their stylist.  When I said I did, they were flabbergasted!  They both agree my hair looks terrible.  Now, It will be at least two months before it grows out again. \n\nI will not go back there and I cannot recommend them, especially this stylist.",0

"I'm not sure this Hollywood import will be around too long. First, the atmosphere. If you've seen the Hollywood Roosevelt Hotel, where the first 25 Degrees is, it's very similar in decor. It's very LA trendy and would be perfect for a lounge, but then you think about the fact that this is a burger joint, and suddenly the posh decor just feels like they're trying too hard. I'll take Delux's casually modern and hip for my burger place any day over dark LA lounge-y. Second, the service is just not good. They bring your onion rings/fries right after you order, but then your burgers don't come for 10 minutes, by which time your rings/fries are cold. They also neglected to bring any side plates for us to share the rings/fries. We asked for the sauce for the burger on the side, and when she brought it out and we asked for the sauce, she said, \""Oh, I think they put it on top.\"" The burger was also supposed to come with Thousand Island, which she forgot and we had to ask for. Then, we had to ask for water after my glass sat empty for 10 minutes with about 6 different servers walking by and not noticing. Now, about the food. It's just not good. The onion rings were greasy and the batter fell right off. The sweet potato fries were soft, mushy, and under-seasoned. The garlic aioli on my burger was basically mayo with a dash of garlic powder. The burgers are flavorful but not nearly as good as Delux, the gold standard for Valley burger joints, IMO. The worst part of all this is that they're overpriced and nickel-and-dime you for everything. Burgers start at $9 and then it's $1.50/cheese, $1/topping, $1/sauce. They even charge for dipping sauce for your fries (other than ketchup, obviously). Finally, there's this misstep by the owners: when you're designing a high-end burger place with a lounge-like atmosphere, a place for people to grab a bite before or after the clubs/bars, you probably shouldn't have the kitchen open up to the dining room so that people leave reeking of the smell of burger and fries grease. I don't know about others, but I prefer not to have the smell of burger grease all over my clothes and in my hair after dinner if I'm going out somewhere after. It's a classic case of a paradox between positioning and actuality.\n\nSave your money and head to Delux instead for a better atmosphere, better service, and MUCH better food.",1
"Let me begin by saying the food was pretty good and the steak was juicy and flavorful. I ordered the snails as an appetizer and the Manhattan Steak. First time I tried snail but they weren't too bad and the steak I really enjoyed w/ the sauce.\n\nNow this place gets 3 stars because the server took forever to come and welcome us and take our orders. We were a group of 7 not that huge of a group and dinner was for 3.5 hrs. I do not think he really enjoyed our table and didn't really converse with us at all.  But as I said the food was good, just the service needs to be a bit better...",2

It has such potential though!\n\nFirstly, who wants to be forced to valet when trying to have a quick lunch?  \n\nThe MAIN complaint is the service!  I sat at the bar to have a drink and an appetizer while I was waiting for my haircut.  I had 45 minutes, so I thought that was plenty of time... it wasn't.  There is one blonde \""hot\"" bartendress who is obviously not hired for her skills.  It took me 10 minutes to get my menu and water and then another 15 of trying my hardest to get her attention to put in my order.  The food came quickly and it was delicious... but this girl spent half of the time talking to two guys at the end of the bar and the other half on her cell texting.  By the end I was standing with cash in my hand to try to get to my haircut on time.  \n\nThey also short-change you.  My bill was $10.27 and I gave them a $20.  She gave me $9 back... I feel cheated because she kept my $.73 as a tip... she didn't deserve that at all.\n\nPS.  This is not my first time, I've given this place many chances and fortunately there are some places close by finally where I can take my money and tip elsewhere!",0
Worst experience ever. We planned to stay 3 nights. When we first walked in the Ac filter looked like it hadn't been changed in 2 years. The quickly replaced it. Then the AC broke. Instead of putting us in a new room they sent someone to fix it hours later and it didn't work. Then it took about another 5 hours to get us a new room. The new room had a huge leak in the sink and water went everywhere. On top of that the pool by our room flooded and they closed it. Then another pool was closed for a private party. The main pool was disgusting. Was super cloudy had floating bandaids and dead bees everywhere. Then I went to speak with a manager and check out and no manager or assistant manager or any one of authority was available to speak with. I will never stay here again. It is also in a rundown part of town.,0
"I call this review, High Hopes and Bubble Nightmares. \n\nI too went to a benefit here, which is completely separate to how in feel about the Bubble Lounge. The organization I was there supporting, couldn't be nicer...but the lounge needs some serious work. \n\nHaving it be part of Aria, you know it's going to be trendy.  The circular bar is nicely set up, as is the rest of the lounge. The finishes are rich and it feels modern and sleek.  \n\nThe problem my friends and I had was the service, or lack of it. We waited a good, 10, 15 minutes at the bar, and watched as the staff served champagne to the other ladies around us, but ignored us as we BLATANTLY HELD OUT OUR HANDS WITH DRINK TICKETS. It was almost like being in middle school again.  Ignored by the cool kids. \n\nWhen passed apps came around, that's what they did.  The servers with trays walked around, and didn't stop at our section of the bar.  When FINALLY a tray of mini crabcakes was set down, we each took one, and immediately, the server took it back.  \n\nThere were also no napkins passed at this time, so my friend and I at one point were left with a skewer of lamb...and left the sticky skewer on the bar.  Classy. \n\nThe passed coconut shrimp was ok...but reminded me of a soggier version of that Margaritaville frozen coconut shrimp in the supermarket freezer section. \n\nThe creme de la creme...\n\nI was sitting at the bar chair, and when the phyllo-wrapped asparagus came around, I stood up (butt still touching the seat of the chair) to get one. I felt something behind me, almost sat down, but REALIZED THERE WAS NO CHAIR UNDER ME! \n\nA woman had taken it from under my bottom!  I looked over her, asked her why she did it, and she, along with her smug boyfriend/manfriend said \""you stood up, so it's mine\"". (Or something to that extent.) \n\nThe manfriend then proceeded to hug the bartender who saw the entire situation go down. \n\nOne server was kind to us, but he was serving Aria, so we didn't deal with him much...which brings me to the conclusion the Bubble Lounge has some serving issues to deal with.  \n\nIn my book, it's all about service.  I don't care who you are, you could be my grandma, a supermodel, a TV news anchor or unemployed.  If you don't serve everyone equally, you've lost my service. \n\nI may try this place again...but it's going to take a lot of improvement.",1
"Unfortunately, we experienced very poor customer service at this hotel.  They were extremely rude with respect to the medical emergency we faced the day of our reservation.  There are businesses that train and develop their employees to stick to a 'policy' - no matter what the situation instead of relying on what makes good business sense.  If a person with lung cancer is not able to make to the hotel despite fully expecting to be able to, this would a situation where it is not advisable to have a monkey at the front desk.  This hotel, had placed a gentlemen at the reception desk whose world revolved around their policy instead of his brain and what is good for the overall hotel's business - it's unfortunate that either this person works for a hotel with such values or that the hotel hired a person with this level of thinking.  I do not recommend this hotel for the simple reason that businesses in 2012, if they want to survive are going to have to stop either hiring monkeys or stop training reasonable people to be monkeys.",0
The lady serving was very* rude. I had to keep saying a little bit more please. Her  serving portion was very off. & when I asked for more cheese I was charged extra which I didn't realize til I got home. Should have stuck to chipotle. Never coming again .,0
"What a deal - a $15.00 car wash for FREE.\n\nThis was the Grand Opening weekend, and they were offering a special deal, everybody on Fri / Sat received a FREE $15.00 Car Wash.\n\nThis is a new location in Charlotte located at the corner of Tyvola Rd and Old Pineville Rd across the street from Keffer Pontiac.\n\nThis location offers free vacuums with every wash, and they do offer a variety of washes to choose from ranging $5.00 - $15.00. \n\nThey do offer monthly packages as well, for high volume users and those who just want to maintain a clean car.\n\nWould highly recommend this location, while it is not touch free, it is very gentle on your finish.\n\nThe staff was very friendly, and should you need assistance, they are readily available.\n\nThanks for the Free Wash, I will back to have my car washed here frequently.\n\nOh Yeah, the vacuums rock! \nLots of suction, it will pick up everything that is not bolted down......the dirt must hate this place. (Just wish I had a bowling ball to test the suction like that old commercial.)\n\n5 Stars for Wiki Wiki Car Wash\n\nNCFoodGuy",4
"Went to this Cracker Barrel on Easter Sunday.  Not really busy but the service was HORRIBLE.  Our group was 8.  We were seated promptly and our waiter came and took our drink order.  His face was expressionless, no personality, no people skills,  just a robot.  I ordered the Chicken Fried Steak with gravy on the side.  When he brought my plate, it had Chicken Fried Steak smothered in gravy with fries and corn!!!  I sent it back and waited a good while until it came back the right way.  He was serving down at the other end of our table and I was waving my arms wildly trying to get his attention as the silverware I unwrapped had dried food on it!   He did not acknowledge me.  He never came back to check on us,  never refilled our drinks.   Terrible, terrible service, I will never go back there.",1
"Good tasting burgers, decent sweet potato fries, and awesome fountain choices (cane sweetened colas). A little overpriced. Wasn't a fan of the $5 milkshake and the manager/owner gave me attitude. Come on now, $5 milkshakes better be worth it!",2
"This is the ONLY place to go for waxing needs! Their waxperts are so knowledgeable and friendly!! Finally a business in Vegas who values their clients and their needs!!!!! The space and environment is so welcoming, private and CLEAN!!! It is not a huge salon that you feel like you are just \""another client\"". Everything about this place is amazing. I had the pleasure of meeting the owner on my last visit and it is no wonder the staff is amazing... she sets a standard that is matched by her employees. I would recommend Wax Hair Removal Bar to anyone who is in the need for a wax service.",4
I placed an ordered here about a month ago and just forgot to do this review so here it is. I had the chicken wing and pizza deal the wings were soggy but flavorful and the pizza was cold and bland. I literally ate one slice and threw the rest of the pizza away a few days later. I did warm up the wings and eat those but this is a place I will not be ordering from again.,1
Seriously tasty made to order taco joint! Great vibe and decor. Tried the enchiladas this time....perfect! Beware of the SUPER hot green salsa....it's lethal but highly addictive! Awesome affordable place to get your mexi fix...LUCHA LIBRE!,4
"9 holes ,I have been going to this place last year & this year once a week. It's always great, well maintained, nice putting green. Yes I seem to loose balls in the water also. MMMMmmm? The price seems very reasonable to me.",2
AJ Lydon is the best !! He finds EXACTLY what your looking for no matter how long it takes and keeps in contact with you during to search process.  A great ASSET to that dealership !!!,3
Great service on such an awesome day in AZ! Happy hour is good as well.,3

"The park is a work in progress, but that progress seems to be so slow. As of this writing the road right after the main entrance seems to be under repair and looks more like a wash than a road.  The main areas seem not to have changed much, except for the riparian simulation behind the pavilion; the water now flows. In all, I think the park could use a bit more attention and a little more TLC.",2
"I have been eating here since the place opened.  They have the best steak I can find in the Phoenix Metro area.  If the price were a little cheaper I would probably eat here more.  That is not to say they are over priced as you get a good deal for your money.  I've had almost everything on the menu, even the fried pickles, and it is all good.  The employees are courteous (and attractive) and the service is fast.  If you come later in the evening, especially Friday to Sunday, you could have to wait up to an hour but it is worth it.",4
Pretty good and super sweet older man as our server. He really went out of his way to check with the kitchen to accommodate me in my requests in changing some things on a dish that I ordered. We loved the sopapillas for dessert too ;) the only thing weird I noticed was the radio was breaking up and going fuzzy which was semi annoying.,3
Yummy food and large portions but very greasy/heavy.  Family friendly and with special cookie selections on weekends.  Worth checking out if not the kind of place you go weekly.,2
"Oh Jet Blue, such a love hate relationship we have going on.. I love your comfy seats, personal TVs, fairly decent staff, and reasonable prices. But I strongly dislike the two times in two months I was stuck in Vegas for over 2 hours due to MECHANICAL delays. \n\nI understand weather issues, but TWICE in less than two months, 2 different aircraft's were grounded due to mechanical issues, that's pretty scary. \n\nI say get it together huns!!! I'll be using my second credit for my 3rd flight at some point where I will be deciding if it will ever be worth using this airline ever again. \n\n3rd time's the charm?",2
It's over priced for what you get. The lobster mac and cheese says the lobsters blended in but what you get is cold lobster thrown on top of Mac & Cheese. \n\nThe only thing worth the money is the lobster bisque in a bread bowl.  \n\nIf you have money to spare you could eat here or save your money and eat at a sit down restaurant.,1
"Heard my order wrong...TWICE. First time I ordered Curry chicken, they gave me Kung Pao Chicken, I didn't accept the order and asked them to give me curry chicken, they just poured some curry over the kung pao chicken and gave it to me -.- \nSecond time I ordered Zha Jiang Mien (Noodle with pork, cucumber slices and sauce), I got Chicken Noodle soup, SERIOUSLY?\nOtherwise food is ok ad price is ok.",2
"I just moved to the area and needed a new salon. Don't go here though! WORST pedi ever! The woman stabbed me with the cuticle tool no less than 10 times, made my toes bleed, and then poured alcohol on my toes while they were still bleeding!! Are you serious?!?! No apology either. Then, when asked why I wasn't leaving a tip, I asked her if she was there during my pedi. I love getting this done, and I always tip well because I know what it's like to live on tips, but I don't feel bad about this and I'll NEVER be back. Don't go!",0
"Unfortunately my experience with this towing company was terrible.  They had two cars delivered to my house before confirming with me that I knew about this.  Since I had no idea they were being towed to me I was not home to sign for them.  I called the dispatcher, who was loud mouthed, belligerent and of no help at all.  She first tried to tell me my house did not exist and there was no such address.  I was amazed at the stupidity of that.  Then the dispatcher screamed at me into the phone that the cars were towed back to their lot and I would have to pay 190.00 impound fees to get them out.  I was speechless.  When I finally cleared that up a driver (who also had a attitude) brought the cars back out to me, and in the process of unloading them, he slammed my Dad's historic TR4 into the garage causing damage to both the garage and the TR4.  It has been almost 5 months exactly and  I still have not been paid for the damages to the car.  I do not recommend this towing company at all.",0
"This place has been here a couple of years but keeps improving. \n\nThe wait staff is quick and friendly and the happy hour specials (which seen to run all say) are great deals. My current favorites include the Kawaii roll, spicy crunchy yellow tail, spicy California roll, ninja roll, and the hamachi sushi. However, they have a wide menu and we have always enjoyed it when we strayed from our regulars.  \n\nKelley is the hostess most times we are here and she has routinely gone above and beyond for customers. Once, bringing a niece who was unsure of sushi, she offerred anime-style stickers to our neice. It was a big hit and really put a new food adventure for a 12 year old in a fun and positive light. \n\nDon't miss this place, it is awesome!",4
"Best time I ever had was in this restaurant! Me and my husband  booked our valentine's dinner with them and we had the most wonderful experience . While dinning , you could hear and see the Bellagio fountain running, the food was ok, and everything else worth going! Love it, highly recommend it!",4
"I was headed to TeePee, but at the last moment had a change of heart. I decided to go for a new Italian place, and this small restaurant caught my eye. Very small dining room, with nice tables positioned so you can sit close to your date. I had the prosciutto and melon, which came served as a single slice of Cantaloupe sitting on a bed of prosciutto. It was OK, but I was not a fan of the presentation. For my entree I had the Veal Parm, and it was sub-par. It felt like a chicken fried steak. The wine selection was nice, but not anything noteworthy. I noticed three servers, only one of which actually fielding questions, the other two in charge of bread and busing only. I would have preferred a darker, more intimate atmosphere, but it was not bad. The bill for two came to approx $80. I don't think I'll be back, there are too many spots to check out before this place deserves a second visit. Nice if this is your neighborhood Italian spot for a mid-week meal.",1
"After hearing all the raving about this place, figured I would try it out.  Went about 5PM on a Saturday afternoon and was told to expect a 70-90 minute wait, which was not a problem as they text you and give you a web link to check where you were in line.  We wandered the strip mall and saw us move quickly to under 10 and about a hour later, we got the \""ready\"" text.\n\nQuickly seated and ordered, the food came out, it was okay, not good, not great, but okay.  $85 for two kids meals, 4 shakes (2 adult, 2 w/o alcohol) and tip.\n\nGood but not great food, shakes were the best part of the meal.",2
"Ill give two stars but ONLY, because our server was awesome. Other than that save yourself at least $20 and go across the street to the Texas Roadhouse.\nIt was a Saturday night, so we did have to wait, but I would say it wasnt any longer than 10 minutes.  the staff was nice, and friendly, and as I stated before our server was great!\nThe food however was not we ordered the Parmesan Crusted Asparagus for an appetizer which was ok but lacked any real flavor. My boyfriend got a a 6 oz sirloin with mashed potatoes a chopped salad and a side of sauteed mushrooms and grilled shrimp. I opted for the Napa Chicken with the corkscrew mac n cheese w/bacon. \nThe highlight of our meal had to be the shrimp. It was cooked perfectly, and who can go wrong with lemon and melted butter.  The rest was just not very good, the steak was overcooked, and the sauteed mushrooms were not fresh, they were undoubtly from a can\nThe chicken was cooked well but definitely needed salt, and pepper. The chicken came topped with artichoke hearts roasted tomatos and Portobello mushrooms. The tomato and mushroom were fresh, but the artichokes were pickled and it threw the taste of the dish off. The mashed potaotes and mac and cheese were the same as the asparagus and were mediocre at best, and the salad, well it was definitely from a bag and I wouldn't be surprised if the dressing was as well. \nAfter tip the bill was close to $70. Not worth it by a long shot. We will not be going back.",1
"Das ist eine Apotheke mit Service...\n\n\n Au\u00dfer dem normalen Apothekensortiment gibt es meist gute Tipss zu alternativen Heilmitteln wie Hom\u00f6opathie und Aromatherapie. \nWas Hom\u00f6opathie angeht, ist das die Apotheke in Karlsruhe mit dem meisten KnowHow.

"The nicest staff you'll ever meet, great food and real southwest atmosphere!\nYou really can't go wrong with anything on the menu. Ribs (full rack), Steak and Cajun Shrimp a must! Start off with the onion block and then enjoy some cornbread as well prior to your entree.\nThe portions are large and the side dishes (2) come with each entree. So be careful how much you order- maybe one entree and some apps.\nSit inside or outside and use Open Table for no waiting! \n\nA win win for all the family!!!",3
"Awesome- tuna bowl- love this tiny place. The dishes are imaginative, fresh and fun to eat. Don't come as a gang- 4 diners together is max- a t\u00eate-a-t\u00eate is perfect.  Don't be out off by the lineup either- well worth the wait. This place is a jewel!",4
I don't know what all the hype is for this place but I was not a fan. \n\nI asked for recommendations and was let down. My cupcakes were nothing special and the cheesecake I had was ok. \n\nKinda seems out of the way unless you are in the casino.,1
"If you didn't walk into a bar, you wouldn't know you were eating pub food. Amazing mac & cheese. Great wings. The 'famous' pimento cheese is awesome. If you are there for breakfast, get the biscuits and gravy. They are the best I've had in Charlotte! \n\nThe atmosphere is great and with the new deck open it is the place to be! If i lived closer, I'd be there every night.",4
"It was a bit better than average for airport food.\n\nI did carry out - plenty of sandwiches for around $10 each, all including french fries.  I ordered the cuban sandwich - roast pork, ham, swiss, pickle, mayo & mustard on bread, then pressed.  The pork was a bit fatty, but otherwise, not shabby.  The fries were rushed, I believe.  It was like they almost had them cooked properly and took them out about 30 seconds too early.  Boo.  Oh well, salt fixes just about anything.\n\nThe gal who took my order at the carry out counter was very friendly & promised me that my order would be up in 8 minutes...mine only took about 5.  It was obviously fresh off the grill.\n\nSo, it was just a kind of yum, but for an airport, not too shabby, I suppose.",2
"Wow really impressed with this place! Really tasty food that doesn't give you that \""I hate myself\"" feeling after eating Chinese take out.\n\nNot terribly greasy, fresh veggies and tasty sauces that aren't overly slathered on their meats.  We had an awesome smorgasbord of spring rolls (delish), egg drop soup (one of the best I've had), general tso's- unique but very tasty!, wonderful chicken lo mein, very healthy portion and the Mongolian beef was a bit overly onion-y, but we enjoyed everything and delivery was even early! Check this spot out.",3
"First off this is not the original long wongs, how do I know this, because one I know the franchise owner and two because my father designed the original logo. This owner is very naive and claims he designed the logo because he put flames around the original logo. \n\nNo here's the objective view of this particular  Long Wongs. Usually I just pick up a combo of wings and fries. Prices are reasonable however if you do get wings your mostly paying for the excess sauce they put onto the wings. Fries are ok nothing really special, Burgers are meh, the only reason why I go to this long wongs over the one on Thomas is because of the proximity. I'm not afraid to say I go here just because it's close by, however there other places to go to like Native New Yorker as well as Buffalo Wild Wings right around the corner.\n\nOver all it's an ok place to dine nothing really special decor can use some updating. On a personal note this owner isn't even paying any franchising fees or anything plus some of the staff is rude at this location",1
"Just tried this place due to it's glowing reviews from several friends. I saw a Groupon for their breakfast and figured it would be the perfect opportunity. \n\nWe ordered the G&P breakfast burrito, egg whites with sausage, and the whole grain pancakes. The burrito lacked any kind of flavor and was very wet. It was literally laying in a pool of liquid. I didn't try the sausage for the eggs but my stepson didn't care for them at all...once again no flavor.\nThe pancakes were the best out of the three, but were kind of on the dry side. I didn't mind but my significant other doused them on extra syrup.\n\nI will try this place again, just not for breakfast. Maybe come back around lunch time bc that menu looked great.",2
"The white trash burger is mouth wateringly delicious. One of my favorite burgers anywhere. Tasty with waffle fries. Great, friendly service.",4

"The hotel was a great deal for the price.  We had a clean and comfortable room overlooking the strip, it was a Pyramid Deluxe suite.  The hotel was clean, service was friendly, they have good clubs, a nice casino.  The only thing I didn't like was their buffet, and the older style TV in the room.  However, it was on the strip and had shuttles to Mandalay and Excalibur which was nice.  It's hard to find a good deal like this on the strip.",3
"Grind seems to be a really popular spot for college kids to watch sports. It was packed with people watching games and they offer quite a few specials when UNLV is playing. It's a lot smaller inside than it appears and can get really busy. That's my biggest complaint for this spot. It got friggin LOUD in there, to the point where we felt like we were screaming at each other to talk. \n\nThis was my first Juicy Lucy burger experience and dang it was good! There's a good amount of toppings to pick from...I got lettuce, bacon, grilled onions and green chiles. The patty itself was delicious, great seasoning and really juicy. It was a tad overcooked for me but didn't take away from the flavor at all. If you love cheese like I do, you won't be disappointed with the Juicy Lucy. The cheese inside the patty just oozes out and it's hot, gooey and delicious! I really liked their buns too. They have a slight crisp on the bottom then super soft on the top. \n\nThey also have a bunch of sauces that you can choose which they bring on the side and I love that. I hate when places douse a burger with condiments. Best part is there's plenty to dip your fries in too. The fries were alright and they have a decent edamame appetizer but both were a little expensive. All in all this is a solid burger joint! The service was good too so I wouldn't hesitate to come back.",3
"What an amazing world we live in. We can cure diseases, put men in space, and pack literally thousands of songs onto one little MP3 player - but we can't make a better DMV.\n\nI came in here a few months ago because I had to have a duplicate license made, since mine had gone missing. I thought this was going to be a quick procedure with no major flaws.\n\nBut once I got up to the counter, the woman who was waiting on me (a middle-aged red-haired woman) was extremely pretentious and rude, and contradicted information explicitly stated on the DMV web site. The site said you needed a state-issue picture ID and one of another form of ID. I had a Social Security card, which was one of said forms of ID. I brought EVERYTHING the web site had asked me to. And she said it wasn't good enough.\n\nShe started bitching at me, even though I explained that this was exactly what the website said. The customer is always right, you pretentious jerk. Apparently you didn't learn that when you went through customer service training - if you went through it at all. Eventually I was able to find sufficient ID in my wallet, but this woman was extremely rude all the while. If you're working at the DMV, you damn well better know what the website says, and uphold it. Just because you chose to work in a job with rude customers doesn't give you the right to be rude to me.\n\nThe facility itself is actually very nice and quite large, however even so it STILL manages to get overcrowded, and wait times for things like this are unbearable. I thought getting my duplicate license made would be a pretty painless procedure, and I'd be out of there in an hour, hour-and-a-half tops. It took OVER THREE HOURS. \n\nThe parking is terrible, it is clear whoever invented this facility didn't know that LOTS of people go to a DMV. It isn't uncommon, as a result, to have cars illegally parked on the street. Furthermore, other neighboring shopping centers have begun putting up \""parking for customers only\"" signs, so that is looking to be less of an option. It looks like construction has begun on another parking lot, but we'll see what happens.\n\nAnother annoyance is that you no longer get your renewed/duplicate license/permit during your visit - they have to mail it to you now. I liked being able to leave with my license in my pocket. Why change something that wasn't broken in the first place? \n\nThis place either needs to be expanded or another DMV needs to be built in Henderson. And the bitchy woman that waited on me needs to be fired. Enough said.",1
"Im not a tea person, but my wife is.  Neither of us are in to social trendy scenes, but Urban Tea Loft deliver a great experience.  Friendly and down to earth not snooty.  Great selection of more than just teas (they even have hard liquors).  The food is fabulous.  If you are in Chandler and have not checked out the loft you are missing out.",3
"This review its dated: 1.4.15\nI decided to order a smoothie instead of a coffee this time to try it out. That was a bad idea. First off the guy at the bar asked one of the other workers how tho make it, I ordered the Orange and mango, it tasted like straight whey protein and water no flavor at all. I Will stick to my coffee from now on.",0
So far so good.  Great friendly staff.,4
"I had very high expectations going in, and I was not disappointed.\n\nI've eaten at a lot of amazing places, I was raised foodie, and very little intimidates me.  But I will have to say, I was kind of on the defensive when I came here.\n\nFirst of all, it was a little awkward as I was dining solo.  My dinner companion had bailed on me, so I was going in on my own.  Additionally, I didn't make a reservation and just sauntered in.  Glad I had an extra sportcoat with me.  The ambiance was amazing, beautiful, exactly what I expected.  The two hostesses were tall, gorgeous women in couture dresses.  As I was mustering up courage to enter, I pulled the two huge front doors way too hard, almost causing a scene.  As I sauntered up to the stand, quickly regaining composure, I announced I would like to have dinner and didn't have a reservation.  There was some murmuring and they asked me to sit in the lounge while they spoke to the manager.  I didn't even have a chance to sit and they whisked me away to my table.\n\nI was seated on the bench side of a table for two, with a couple next to me and a third gentleman dining alone immediately next to them.  This is significant, because I couldn't help but eavesdrop, as it was so quiet in the restaurant and we were all in such close proximity.  The male half of the couple seated next to me, was on the opposite side of the table, and the bastard would not stop looking at me during my meal, which was frankly just weird and did detract from my overall experience.\n\nThey asked me if I wanted a cocktail, and when I said Martini, they correctly assumed gin and asked for my preference.  I chose Hendricks and recommended they use a cucumber slice as a garnish.  The server came back with a perfect Martini in a crystal glass, and he told me that the bartender said 'thanks' for the idea of a cucumber garnish, that it paired perfectly - he said they would recommend it in the future.\n\nI started with amuse-bouche of a tomato puree served over a custard - perfect combination of flavors. I must take a moment as well to mention that the table setting was beautiful, all silver flatware, perfect china, and sparkling crystal vessels.  Whenever I would finish with a utensil or another dining implement, they would spirit away the offending dirty item to an impossibly large silver tray in the center of the room, which they would carry away only to immediately replace with another giant silver tray.  It was almost humorous when it was a lone cocktail glass.\n\nNext they arrived with a huge cart full of dozens of freshly-baked breads.  I spent half of my time just being walked through what was contained on the cart.  Not wanting to spoil my meal, I chose a modest selection, although the gentleman manning the cart was insistent that I try more.  I settled on a fresh Gruy\u00e8re brioche  and a roll that had bacon within.  Then another fellow came by and engaged in a complex ritual where he carved fresh butter from Brittony with a chilled spoon and put it on my plate with a little fleur de sel.  The bread was incredible, unsurprisingly.\n\nNext up, I had the langoustine ravioli with truffle, cream and chopped cabbage.  Not only was it a delicate flavor explosion, it also had fantastic texture.  Thank goodness there were only three, because I am quite sure I could have eaten a bucket of them.  The next course was a fava bean soup served over a rosemary foam, again, flavors were incredible and there was just enough to get the flavor, but not too much.  During the meal, the service was not only incredibly attentive, but also not pretentious.  I really appreciated that.\n\nFor my main course, I had a splendid duck breast with foie gras and almond-stuffed sweet and sour cherries.  Easily the most perfect duck I have ever partaken of, and the sommelier paired the perfect wine with it.  \n\nTo finish the meal, I chose the Earl Grey rice krispy with raspberry milk mousse, a nice blend of sweet and tart.  I ordered some fantastic coffee and they ended with the dessert cart, where the gentleman who manned that cart foisted more and more treats upon me.  I especially loved the baba ahrum, caramels and the jellies he offered.\n\nI felt as one should after a repast like this, completely sated.  Price be damned, this is what culinary art tastes like.",4
"Looking for some Chinese buffet, came across this place. Wandering in it was not busy and the buffet was depleted of everything. Finally the kitchen staff started bringing out items and filled up the buffet, only good thing about this place. Pretty bland, not worth visiting!!!",0
Great place for locals. Service is very good and made me feel like I was their only customer. I had the chicken Reggie with the hottest spice level. Great taste and will be back. My complements to the chef!,4
mannnnn this place is good!!!!!,4
"Food was okay, but horrible service! Our waitress barely came around & gave us attitude when we were ordering. I think Tawny was her name?",0
"Pretty good place to grab a quick lunch in Scottsdale Quarter.  The atmosphere was cool and relaxing, the service was nice and the food was good and super quick.  The veggie tacos were really good and the chips and salsa weren't bad either.  Hopefully this place will last longer than the previous restaurant.",3
"OK I am a sucker for wings.  I love them all unless they are afterthoughts like at many pizza joints.\n\nWingstop gets my votes for multiple flavor choices and the fact that they cook them after you order them.  Sure it takes a few more minutes, but you know they are fresh and crisp.\n\nAt this particular location they were very friendly and courteous.  The interious has an airplane motif, but otherwise it is non-descript.",3
"Delightful, practical, and a great spin on a deli/cafe!\n\nThe Pittsburgh Deli Company is anything but just a deli. It contains a wonderful assortment of sandwiches, salads, and soups mixed with the style of a local pub and clean cafe. I believe that the PDC stands out in the midst of typical Shadyside offerings that boast one-word names, pretentious menus, and expensive choices.\n\nTheir shredded jerk chicken panini will satisfy a hungry lunch-goer with any sized appetite. Check them out!",2
"She took 1 and 1/2 hours to blow dry my hair. I asked for a classic straight blowout with slightly flipped ends. She made me look as curly as Shirley temple. Then she charged me $45 instead of the quoted $35 because \""my hair is super long\"". My hair is NOT that long, but it is very thick so I think I was overcharged because I have thick hair. It's not what I wanted. It's not what I asked for. It's took forever. And I was overcharged. I had to go home and spend even more time flat-ironing my hair to get it at least a little how it I asked for it to look. $55 for a terrible blow out including tip? No thanks. Never again. It's infuriating to spend so much time and money and not get what you pay for. I do not recommend this place. I even had areas of hair that were still wet and I had to ask her to dry them \""again\"". What a waste of money.",1
"awfull!!! we paid 53 $ for 5 minutes of what you never pay in any amusement  park...\ndefenetly... t they rying to get the tourism to pay for an awful  experience.... we came from spain and we got that 1000 better in any ammusement park.... very, very  disappointing...\nand expensive.... probably they they need to amortized.... dont even waist your time...\nnada que ver! el pasaje del terror del tibidabo 1000 veces mejor! y gratis!!!!.",0
"Never been so disrespected in my life, I'm a repeat customer but I guess that doesn't mean anything because we don't tip? but last time I was there I didn't even receive my side of fries such a simple order but yet nothing, so why would I  tip? hell even confronted the bartender about it but she was very rude about it , I even had the receipt ! but I guess receipts dont count?  I've spent hundreds of dollars on their slots before , been going there for 3 years now, you guys say its dirt cheap but i guess my money was not good enough for the bartender, i wish i knew her name but i know its not Ciara she's awesome, i  dont have a problem with stone house i just have a problem with that new bartender .  GET IT TOGETHER",0
"Great concept for dining out - every dish under 475 calories all made with seasonal ingredients! I had reservations but was told it would be a few minutes or choose open seating at the bar. We opted for the bar and turns out the live piano player and her beautiful voice were a perfect complement to our meal. \n\nThe food was fresh, tasty, and beautifully presented. I had the lemongrass salmon salad. The lettuce is placed in a glass cylinder which is removed once the dish is placed in front of you. The moist and flaky salmon filet was cooked with a piece of lemongrass through it. The ahi tuna salad also received good reviews. The wine list was so-so. Anytime you put that a wine is from California but doesn't state where in California, I'm a bit suspicious.\n \nBut the BEST part of the meal had to be the dessert portion of the menu. All seven mini-indulgences are actually presented to you at the table and you can choose directly from the selection. Each mini dessert comes in what looks like a double shot glass so it's only a few bites but since I lack a real sweet tooth, it's just the right amount. And if you can spare the calories, you can order a few different selections as I saw other diners doing. Our choices: the chocolate peanut butter mousse (FANTASTIC!!) and the carrot cake. \n\nOur server, Hillary B., was friendly and knowledgeable and even has her own business cards! Overall, a great place to for a pleasant, healthy meal (as long as you don' t order multiple courses and glasses of wine). Would love it if this chain comes to the Bay Area sometime soon.",3
Amazing sushi that is well priced and sure to please! Best spicy tuna handroll I have ever had!!!!,4
"Nice selection of beer. However, be careful if you paid with a card. One of the servers (I think his name was Ryan) decided to change my tip. Apparently the managers (if they exist) do not care because they never attempted to contact me back.",0
Awful. I've had 8 flights this month and every single one was either delayed or cancelled. Rude. Bad customer service. No charging stations. Old planes. Cranky flight attendants. Agents are never at the gate when they're supposed to and no other agent wants to help you out.\n\nLesson learned: Avoid at all costs in the future.,0
"Something's missing here..... CUSTOMERS!\n\nWhat a lavishly built, extravagantly styled complex. Too bad it's theme is that of a ghost town. I know the recession is a bore, but that can't be the only culprit in this facility's plight. \n\nIn short, this place is just too 'high-end', even the coffee shops are too much for me to take. Who in the world has money to churn out throughout this \""mall\"" -- and that's what it is, a freaking glorified mall, let's face it. \n\nI would like to spend a little money here to buy a donut or something, but I'll need my life savings later on down the road. Not for locals unless you want to kill an hour walking around. Tourists may find it interesting, though I don't know why.\n\nSkip it. You're not missing anything. Stick to walking on the Strip. You want a souvenir? Buy a keychain in one of the Strip casino gift shops.",1
I wish I could give it a bit higher of a rating.....My food was hands down FIVE stars but the service was just meh...\nWe started with the table side Caesar Salad...by the way EVERYONE should make a tableside Caesar! But the person making it had NO personality....my husband even tried to joke around with him and he wouldn't crack a smile....tableside is about a show and we got no show....we barely got a hello.\nOur steaks were AMAZING I had a petite filet and it was cooked perfectly as our side were great too! \nDessert...of course we had the tableside bananas foster...again...same dry tableside waiter....and the desert was just ok...wasn't the best bananas foster I had (I suggest stop using banana liqueur as you don't need a fake banana flavor and Bacardi 151 and use a brandy.....as it doesn't burn as fast and lets the bananas caramelize more without burning...and yes we make this dessert in our house frequently)\nI'd like to go back and have a different waiter...maybe I can upgrade to a 5 star review...as the food was certainly deserving of it.,2
"it's right behind the olympic gardens. heeeeheee.\n\ni tried three different flavors - the banana split, the one with caramel, and a nutty one. i forgot all their names but i like the nutty one the best.\n\nit felt like they were melting much faster than fro yo but it was probably the LV heat. there's no place to sit so we just stood next to the building to eat it. i felt like a bored teen looking for something to do on hot sunny afternoon. then, a bunch of gangsters were heading our way so we jetted from there like our butts were on fire. hey, i dont want to get shot eating frozen custard.",2
"This is a nice spot on the edge of a mall.  Headliner here is \""great food, but very very loud\"" - so loud that you can't have a reasonable conversation over your meal.\n\nI started with a drink - \""the natural\"" - ginger, agave and soda.  This is a very refreshing drink.  I really wanted more, but it's a little expensive to have a lot of them.  We then moved on to an appetizer of caramalized onion tart, with smoked garlic, black fig & gorgonzola.  Again, very delicious, and definitely a keeper.  The main course was halibut street tacos, side of beans with cojita cheese and salsa.  These were just the right size for a lunch entree.  \n\nEverything has that organic thing going for it - fresh ingredients, well prepared.  If this place wasn't so loud, I would consider it for lunch every day I was in Phoenix.",3
"This place was pretty dead when we went in. We sat in the restaurant area rather than the bar since they don't allow smoking. \n\nThe mozzarella sticks were pretty good and probably the best part of the meal. I ordered the bbq bacon burger with fries and it was sub-par. The fries were cold and a little soggy so I politely asked the waitress for a new side of fries. The burger wasn't anything special; not bad but not great. My husband ordered the french dip and I didn't care for that either. The bread was a bit stale and the roast beef was really dry, even after dipping it in the auju (sp?) sauce.\n\nSave yourself the mediocre experience and go next door to volcano grille!",1
"I found Lelia on Yelp and while she was not available for the particular date I needed, she set me up with Marissa. Which was destiny since my name is Marisa too! Marissa contacted me via email and I sent her some pictures of what I was looking for in terms of Make Up and Hair. She arrived to my hotel suite promptly on time and set up shop quickly. We reviewed the look I wanted and it was nothing but perfection till the very end. I found Marissa to be personable and fun. I am often nervous when it comes to someone doing my hair or make up because I rarely like the finished product. I LOVED IT!!! I felt beautiful and there was not a hair out of place. She got all my thick hair up and it stayed put for not only my wedding but the next day too! I will recommend them to any of my friends or if I have the chance to use their services again when I am in Vegas. \n\nMarisa Schafer",4
"Looking for an old school restaurant away from the strip. I had thought of something a bit lighter. The bartender at Zodies bar told me to try Tillermans. It looked like my kind of place from the outside and then when I headed inside, I loved the decor. Old world. The fellow who greeted me assured me that I could find something 'light' on the menu and told me I could eat in the bar if I wanted. There was Rhonda bartending and from what I could figure, two co-workers who were a couple. Meet the Parents was on the tube in the bar. The place was pretty dead for a Friday night. All very friendly people who welcommed me into their 'group'. I had a diet coke and looked over the menu. I decided on the salad bar which is actually a huge lazy susan that is delivered to you with spring mix, romaine, hearts of palm, arugula and so on. The sides on the portable salad bar were delicious; great sour dough bread and butter. Then I ordered the coconut shrimp and was set. It was a warm friendly environment and more food that I could handle for $29.  I will go back and share some bs with the staff-they were the main reason why I loved it. Turns out that the bartender is from my state; Minnesota. She grew up in Anoka which is the Halloween capital of the world!  Next time I will try a full meal.  I adore restaurants like this. You can go to a chain restaurant or a buffet any day -this is service and uniqueness.",3
"I've been trying to figure out the best grocery store to go to in my area, so I have been looking at the weekly store ads I receive in the mail to compare prices. Fresh & Easy seemed to have the best deals on things I needed this week, so I decided to go there for the first time. \n\nI was so disappointed when I realized that the $.48 avocados were really in a pack of four, for a total of $2, which is still a good deal, except that all of the avocados in the bundle were tiny and bright green (not ripe). Their individual avocados, which were mostly way too mushy, but a couple were ripe, were nearly $2!!! Unbelievable.\n\nSimilar to a review I read below, I couldn't buy an individual onion; they were only available in packs of four. I don't eat enough onion to get more than one. Plus, as with the avocados, the pack of onions looked like they were not ripe.\nI agree with other reviews below...some of the prices in the store were really great deals and others were just ridiculously expensive!\n\nThe worst of it all...I bought a bag of oranges. This morning I peeled one and began eating it and found little bits of black things throughout the entire orange. A pretty good amount. I found a bigger black piece to examine and it was hard like a metal. I was able to break it in half and the inside looked metallic?! I have no idea. But the orange was sour and, obviously, after finding black metallic pieces throughout it, I threw the oranges out.\nAwful experience. I will not be returning.",0
"I like Zipps because they have daily food and drink specials, shuffleboard, flat screens tv's, and it's nice inside. I think Zipps has the same frozen margarita machine as Z Tejas because the margaritas taste the same and they will only let you have three. They're awesome make sure you try one next time you go. The only downside to this place is they have the worst bloody mary drink I have every had. The bloody mary mix smells like garbage and tastes like dirt. Its gross. I am obsessed with the nachos here and the rest of the food is pretty standard nothing amazing but good enough to satisfy your drunky munchies.",3
"I love you Butterfields, but I think I could love you more if you made the hostess stand a beverage bar while I wait. It would be awesome!",3
"This really is as good as it gets. I went to Google to find a fix for my iPhone. I called the team at UBREAKIFIX and they told me to come right over.  I love instant service. They took my phone and in a very short space of time i was here typing this review on how fast, and customer friendly the service is.\n\nI highly recommend you call UBREAKIFIX if you are looking for a fix for the iPhone!!",4
"I am always so confused when I go to Red Room. Is this a biker bar with chaps and hogs galore? Or is this some new scene, complete with boys with side-swiped bangs and girls in rocker fashion garb? I never get it. Anyway, the Red Room is a fun place for a casual get together, if you don't mind the completely random crowd. The dj's seem to always get it right with a mix of hip hop, rock, and even some house. The dancefloor is packed at all time once the dj's start, but again, it's a mix of cute little barely twenty-somethings, and men with vests and handlebar staches. The drink prices are pretty cheap as well. I can't imagine how this place looks though during the day. Seriously. If you ever do decide to check out Red Room, please let me know what you think...is this the new downtown crowd taking over an old biker bar? Or is it the other way around?",2
"My father and I have eaten here several times and it is definitely a favorite. My father discovered it when he was staying at a hotel nearby many years ago and wound up eating there every night for a full week. The food is always delicious, the drinks are always delightful, the service has never failed to be friendly and inviting, and the restaurant is always clean.  \n\nThe last meal we enjoyed consisted of a chicken avocado sandwich and the voodoo tuna. The sandwich was arranged on two butter hamburger buns that were so fresh they melted in my mouth and the chicken was moist and very tender. The jalapeno mayonnaise added just the right kick and I scarfed it and the accompanying sweet potato fries down within minutes.\n\nEven though I liked my sandwich, the voodoo tuna was a few steps above it. Juicy lightly seared tuna steak with pickled ginger on the top that gave it so much flavor my tongue didn't know what to focus on first. Dad could barely comment on the meal between bites, it was so good. \n\nWe ordered mojitos that were prepared exactly the way a mojito should be, with lots of mint, lime and just the right amount of rum. The complimentary cornbread was freshly baked and delicious as usual. And to top off the evening, we ordered the chef dessert which was chocolate lava cake filled with a thick dark chocolate center that had a slight hint of peppermint. A scoop of pistachio icecream balanced the dish nicely and by the time we had nearly licked the plate clean, we were stuffed and quite content.",3
"Meh \n\nI went with high expectations since virtually everyone that has been to Vegas had raved about this particular buffet (apparently, buffets are \""the thing to do\"" in Vegas) and assured me that I'd have heck of a time indulging in gastronomical glee.  I had been starving all day and, therefore, had good prospects of visiting it for dinner.\n\nWELL.... For $25 for dinner, sure - it wasn't a bad deal.  But the food variety/quality weren't exactly up to par.  Perhaps I had too high of expectations.  But I really wasn't WOW'd.  Perhaps I'm just in a reallly negative mood (after having written a one-star review of Delta airlines) and such negativity is spilling onto this review.  Nonetheless, I certainly wasn't wow'd by Le Village buffet.  In addition to the disappointing food, our serving lady kept forgetting to get us our beverages and utensils.  But she sure did come by enough times to ask, \""You OK??\""  Kinda strange.  Kinda.\n\nFresh crepes:  Sure, they're fresh all right.  But since when are crepes as thick and puffy as hamburger buns??  The texture was off as well.  The only thing I liked about their crepes was the unlimited availability of fresh blueberries.  Oh yeah, how could I forget -- no chocolate ingredients at a creperie??  Now THAT's outrageous!\n\nWhat I did like was the availability of fresh king crabs and mussels.  Also enjoyable was the decor (but no music??!?!??). \n\nMeh.",2
"Maybe i just ordered the wrong foods, but really, if you can't get a margherita pizza right, i'm afraid to order anything else. I do not understand how this place got such great reviews. I started with a white sangria...no fruits, and it tasted like a watered down limoncello. This was followed by the beet salad....EVERYONE knows that you canNOT toss soft cheeses, such as brie or goat cheese, in a salad, it has to be added after the toss. Otherwise this happens: \""Where's the cheese? Why do the beets look like they have mold growing on them?\"" Yes, this happened....for reals. Now about that pizza. First, it was watery and burnt - that is a feat that seems impossible, but it happened....for reals. The top was soggy and watery. The crust was \""purposely overcooked\"" - but the charred flavor of the crust was overwhelming enough for me to put the slice down and start feeling like my stomach was developing cancer. I will not come back, and I REFUSE to recommend or bring anyone here.",0
"Where do I start?  One of my favorite spots in all of Las Vegas.  This place is a hidden Gem and I think a lot of people pass by it a million times and disregard it.  Here's the Low Down...\n\nDecor:\nSwanky, chic and old school.  One of my favorite \""date places\"" or just a cool place to hang. \n\nThe Booze:\nBTG wine list is solid.\n\nThe cocktails are amazing.  These guys know their stuff and have really mastered the art of Mixology with their craft cocktails.  \n\nExtensive list of all liquors, specifically their Gins and Whiskeys.\n\nSolid beer list\n\nThe food:\n\nThe food as awesome.  Especially for the reverse happy hour!  My personal favorites are the Jalapeno Cream Corn, Kansas City Strip with peppercorn sauce and Prosciutto Asparagus Flatbread.   \n\nIf you haven't been yet, YOU NEED TO GO!",4
Went and saw Nathan's show again at his new theatre.  The theatre at the Miracle Mile Mall matches with Nathan's show - both class acts.  Still have the great prices and the new theatre is much more comfortable than the old. Again I went with the VIP seating and again I was amazed at a great show with a great value.  You never know who his surprise guest might be.  I just read he is adding some new illusions so looks like another trip to Vegas will be in my near future.  Love your show Nathan - wishing you continued success!!,4

when the harley dealer tells you they dont want to help you with pre evolution parts go to cecil. Great prices and knowledge of the older stuff. He helped out alot when I was building a basket cast 76 xlh. by far the best in vegas.,4
"This tends to be a hit or miss whenever I visit. It just happened to be a bit of a miss the last time. Their bbq skewers are always good. I prefer the pork over the chicken. However, the adobo could have produced a food coma I might not have been able to snap out of as it was extremely greasy. No joke, you could see the oil separating itself from the rest of the sauce. Blech! I'll just have to get something else next time, since my family loves this place.",1
"We came here to eat lunch. The server gave our pizza to the wrong people; a family with kids. Once the mistake was brought to their attention, they simply brought the pizza to us - something which is against health code! I'm sure the family picked through it and touched it - slices looked freshley pulled apart and returned to the plate. After a 40+ minute wait, I was unwilling to wait for a remake. They offered a refus. Frankly, I can't return to a place where they would violate health codes like that. The other people in my group are more tolerant of germa and whatnot than I am; they said the pizza was terrible. I'm sure they will be serving the slices we left behind to the next customers to order a pepperoni pizza.",0
"very delicious and good service. byob, which is a dream. love this place.",4
"How is it possible for me to have not only stayed here, but visited no less than 20 times, and not have written about it? \n\nLuv the lobby bar & live entertainment, Spanish Guitar & Flamenco Dancing.  Our many out-of-town-guests thouroughly enjoy this.\n\nThe grounds are just stunning as you walk in from the lobby, down the stairs and out through the glass doors to the beautiful views.\n\n1 of the most romatic things to do is the super unique gondola rides they have in the evening.  It always stuns a couple we bring here!  We surprise them by ending the evening with escorting them to the docks, and leaving them to fininsh their night off after thier private ride on the moon-lit lake.  (Complete with the gondolier singing professional Opera!)\n\nNow, how cool is that?!",4
"Lunch $ 21.00 / Person - Dinner $ 26.00 / Person for AYCE.\n\nRice, rice, rice and a brick of rice in my belly. This place really knows how to give the illusion of a good fish to rice ratio by giving lengthy fish slices, but underneath you meet your doom of impending rice. They compacted the rice so it was thick like a rock.\n\nThe menu selection is not great for AYCE, you have many limits on what and where you can order from. No sashimi, no soft shell crab (only in rolls), no half rolls, all the rolls are large standard size -mostly 8 pieces with the exception of some that are 5 pieces (still the same large size as the 8 pieces, just cut differently.) Not a great place if you want to try a bunch of different rolls. Even the nigiri selection was limited and overall pretty unimpressive.\n\nDon't even think about ordering the ahi poke, seafood salad, salmon skin salad, or any of their salads for that matter. They were crazy weak in flavor/ fish/ execution. I wasn't happy with them. At all. \n\nThe only redeeming dishes were:\n1. Dynamite appetizer \n2. Salmon belly nigiri\n3. Baked mussels \n4. Green tea creme br\u00fbl\u00e9e\nAnd that's it...\n\nThe service we received was below average. They weren't even busy! There were 2 other tables dining besides us. We had to ask multiple times to different servers to grab us wasabi and hot sauce. Our waitress was missing, most of our dinner.\n\nIn the end, we left feeling uncomfortably stuffed due to the dense rice expanding. To top it off, it was hot and stuffy in there, and the music made my ears bleed. I agree the interior design was new, modern, beautiful, and spacious, but the overall night club vibe of the restaurant was highly disconcerting. \n\nIn a city that loves a good AYCE sushi joint, this is not the place to go. I would recommend another Korean ran spot that does a better job: Sakana. \n\nNow, with a belly busted from rice, I bid you good luck and good evening.",1
"I had very high hopes for this place, as its the new 'home' of the Charlotte MSU Spartan's group.  We showed up early Saturday evening with friends and were asked by a bouncer if we were here for Michigan State.  He told us the MSU game watch was downstairs, but they would ONLY be showing that game there. Since our friends were interested in other games, the bouncer advised us to have a seat in the main dining room, as they were going to have a bunch of games on. \n\nWe were greeted, promptly seated, and brought beers from their fairly large draft list. The interior was decorated in a cool way - kind of industrial, with lots of wooden beams. The waitress was nice, but quickly became busy - can't blame her; it was game day! \n\nOur plan was to stick around for some football, have some drinks and maybe get some food. That plan, however, was quickly derailed. After maybe about an hour, every TV was changed to  the Miami game. At first we thought it was a malfunction, because the picture quality was so terrible. In fact, we realized that they were actually streaming this game from someone's computer - you could even see a cursor hovering in the corner. \n\nWe asked the waitress if she could get someone to change a couple of the TVs in the area to one of the other 6 games that were going on at the time. She agreed and hurried off, only to return with bad news. She advised us that the front half of the bar was designated for Miami and that the back half had other games on.... but there were no available seats in that area. To make matters worse, a group of rather obnoxious Miami fans were sat next to us. \n\nPart of the experience of going out for a football game is getting there early, staking out the best view in the house, and settling in for some beer and wings. What's the point of getting a table if they are going to change EVERY screen to a different game? Draught succeeded in alienating me and my friends. I can't rate them on their food, because we didn't want to stay to watch a poor feed of a came none of us were interested in. \n\nBetter luck next time, Draught.",1
"The theatre is good and I will say clean. I did not find the Imax theatre to be impressive. Overall this could have been any theater, anywhere. It was pretty nondescript.",2
"Completed disappointed with my stay here :( I bought a LivingSocial deal here for the weekend. At first I was amazed because it looked swanky but it went downhill quickly. We got to the room and we found that a bunch of lights were not working. We requested an extra comforter or blanket and never got it (and we had to request it again). The sink handle completely came out of the wall it was mounted into and there was even a power outage and everyone was stranded because the elevators didn't work. Ugh, I would not come back here.",1
"I have lots of different comfort foods. But restaurants where pieces of flair are a fashion statement are always a comfort food gold mine. Maybe it's because I grew up on Applebee's?\n\nNonetheless, I like this TGI Friday's better than most others. The food is just what you'd expect from any other joint in the same franchise. My personal favorites are the wedge salad (or as my friends and I call it \""the iceberg salad you have to prep yourself\"") and the Jack Daniels dishes. I actually have occasional cravings just for that. The only \""downside\"" at this location is the quirky mix of staff. But just see for yourself on that.",3
"Mmm.  This is probably the opposite of Chaya -- where I go when I want to pay very little and stuff myself with somewhat Americanized food.  Then again, what do I know about whether it's authentic?  I haven't been to Japan or Korea.\n\nI always order the sushi, and even though I have a huge appetite when it comes to that vinegared rice, I can't usually make it through three rolls here.  These are generous portions.  The beef bowls and Korean BBQ are great too, or so I'm told.\n\nThe cushion seating along the window is cute, despite the crappy view of Oakland Avenue, but unfortunately I'm too tall to sit there comfortably (at only 5'6\""!)",4
"The pictures of the casino that are posted on here are accurate to the reality of just how many people are inside gambling. Went inside on a Saturday night and it was seriously a ghost town. We counted 18 people on the floor playing table games. 10:30pm on a Saturday night. 18 people. The staff waiting at empty tables looked like they wanted to shoot themselves, just to end their misery. \nThis place cost 3.9 billion dollars to build. LOLOLOLOLOL- ouch. Good luck recouping that when no one is there on a Saturday night. We headed down the street and gambled at casinos where actual people were.",1
"Ahhh...le hockey est de retour! Il y a environ 6 mois, mon chum et moi on a d\u00e9cid\u00e9 d'annuler le c\u00e2ble, \u00e7a veut dire qu'on devait se trouver quelques bons spots pas trop loin de chez nous pour les soir\u00e9es o\u00f9 l'on aurait une envie de regarder nos chers Canadiens jouer. Direction Epoxy! Lorsqu'on est arriv\u00e9, environ 45 minutes avant le d\u00e9but du match, il y avait seulement 4-5 personnes assises au bar. D'un c\u00f4t\u00e9 je me disais que \u00e7a avait l'air pas mal tranquille et presque trop calme, mais d'un autre, on a eu l'embarras du choix pour d\u00e9cider o\u00f9 s'avoir et donc on a pu se prendre une bonne table. De 4 \u00e0 7 ils ont des sp\u00e9ciaux sur les bi\u00e8res (4$ pour un pinte de Molson Ex, ou $2 de rabais sur les shooter) et par la suite, les prix sont d\u00e9cents. Vers la fin du match, on s'est s\u00e9par\u00e9 un pichet de Cardigan; elle est dont bien bonne cette bi\u00e8re l\u00e0 pour une marque nationale! La cuisine est pr\u00e9sentement ouverte seulement \u00e0 l'heure du lunch, mais vous avez le droit de commander ce qu'il vous pla\u00eet et les bartenders se font un plaisir de vous donner une pile de menus du coin. Sinon, il y a aussi un fast-food juste \u00e0 c\u00f4t\u00e9 si \u00e7a ne vous d\u00e9range pas de manquer quelques minutes du match. La rumeur veut aussi que depuis hier, ils ont un \u00e9cran g\u00e9ant pour regarder le hockey...",3
"From the outside this looks unassuming. However, once inside it opens up to a large restaurant room. The service was excellent. The food was good but couldn't quite decide if it wanted to be French or Italian. That comment aside, the food was very good. We chose the prix fix menu and found it quite good. Overall, We enjoyed a quiet (for Las Vegas) enjoyable meal.",3
"We stumbled back to this place to close out the evening a couple times while staying in Pittsburgh, and it was worth stumbling to. The patrons were friendly, there was no shortage of sports on TV, and the beefcake waitress didn't let a single Yuengling get under a quarter-tank before I had a fresh cold one on the way. All that, and the prices weren't too absurd. A fine hotel bar.",2
"Oysters was not fresh, had a fishy taste. Food was very salty. Clam linguini red sauce looked and tasted like it came out of a can with runny sauce. Scallops had \""lobster bread crumbs\"" toppings, but couldn't taste the lobster and tasted like biting into a chunk of salt. Waitress said I ordered all of their best dishes...i'm a little confused as to why they all tasted so bad if they're the best???!! #headscratch",0
Great pizza for a reasonable price. Very creative to offer take & bake and makes dinners much more efficient.,4
"I was excited to see this place open for two reasons. \n\n1. I am a big fan of cupcakes\n2. It's close to my house\n\nI love red velvet cakes and decided to try that one.  Little to say I was disappointed.  The cupcake was lacking in flavor and consistency.  It felt a little dense as other reviewers had mentioned.  I wasn't also a fan of the filling inside.  I was also hoping for a better presentation with the frosting.  The frosting on top was good, that at least saved the cupcake for me.  I won't write this place off, but hoping the other flavors are more redeeming.",1
"A large group of us dined here before the Britney show.  It's definitely a good burger spot.  We shared a bunch of starters which were all delicious - soba noodle salad, green salad, buffalo chx wings, along with their variety of fries.  We were all stuffed by the time our burgers arrived.  I ordered one with goat cheese, roasted tomato and truffle aioli.  The truffle was not overpowering and just enough.  \n\nThey have a ton of surrounding TVs and a good option if you're at planet hollywood. Although I wouldn't make it a destination.",2
"is this a new club? Because it sure does not look like it. I thought aria would of upped their game a bit since their hotel & whole city center is so extravagant that they would for sure have a gorgeous club!....but NO. all I remember about this club is, its super dark has 2 floors, a very tiny dance floor, & the fake fog machine blows like every 5 minutes & makes it all hazy inside & hard to see. Maybe that's why they call it HAZE. But def not one of my fav clubs in vegas & not worth going to.\n\nBut...ladies, to attract more ppl to the club, they always let you in free before 11, & often times pass out\n1 free drink voucher.",1
"Didn't know what to expect coming here but was impressed. My impression from the outside was that everything would be absolutely and sickeningly made out of chocolate-but I had to see for myself. \n\nIronically, I had nothing that contained chocolate-although there might have been some in the espresso, not too sure though. I started with an orange smoothie which was nice and cinnamony but I am not a fan of the metal straw, steel apparently is not too tasty. I had the huevos rancheros burrito which was awesomelicious. It came with nice crispy tater tots and the burrito was spiced well.\n\nMax has nailed all aspects of a good restaurant, food, reasonable prices, and great service as well as an attractive setting. The tables are tiny though - barely fit the platter of delicious-ness.",4
"The main reason I am writing this review, other than the fact that this place is awesome is because of the honesty of the staff.  In vegas it is rare that you find such honesty and this place has it in abundance.\nour bill was 240 between three of us, and we left a 60 dollar tip. \nMy two friends got checks that were for a 100, so mine was for 40 and i wrote in 60, but accidentally wrote my total as 300 rather than 100.  The gracious host called my room and corrected my error which is not something that they had to do.\nI have always loved Katsuya, pretty sure I wrote them a stellar review for their hollywood location.  Clearly they have a strong program for training staff, and their food is amazing too!\nGo here!!!!!!!!",4
"I only ever get the #1 here (Italian).  Because it's good and I like it and what's wrong with that?  There's one guy who makes them better than the others, so I like it when he's there.  I think he puts just the perfect amount of dressing on.  Nothing extraordinary here, but a solidly good sandwich that I can't pass up when I'm in the neighborhood.",2
"This review is based on a recent stay at the \""Laurel Collection\"" rooms in the Octavius Tower.  Short answer is:  don't.\n\nI visited during a busy weekend and was happy to get several emails asking me to check-in online so they could be ready for me when I showed up.  They also mentioned that I could use the VIP Porte Cochere on Flamingo Ave instead of the main on-strip entrance.  So, after battling the hideous strip traffic, I went right by the main entrance, which was a zoo, and zipped into the VIP entrance only to see two signs:   one said \""Laurel Collection.\""  The other said \""Valet Full:  Seven Stars and Diamond Only.\""\n\nWhen I asked the valet what to do the Valet Full sign won -- I was Laurel Collection, but not Seven Stars or Diamond -- he rejected me and offered lame directions to get back to the main entrance -- which I did some 30 minutes later.  I was livid.  \n\nThink about this:  I was at the main entrance, I drove by it because they said I could use the VIP side entrance, and then they wouldn't let me.  So I had to cross Interstate 15, come back up Flamingo, sit through numerous light cycles, finally make the left onto the Strip, and then fight to make the left turn into Caesar's ... all in all taking me to self-parking -- the farthest possible spot from the Porte Cochere --  which, by the way, was itself jammed.\n\nOn arriving I told them this tale, and a manager named Andrew offered to put a $50 food and beverage credit on my bill.  After I left, I noticed that they couldn't even get that right -- no such credit was applied.  F**k you very much.  Empty promises squared.\n\nAll that aside, Caeser's is simply too big for its own good and unless you are Diamond or Seven Stars you will most likely find yourself -- even in the Laurel Collection -- treated as a 2nd or 3rd-class citizen.\n\nBy the way, I think \""Laurel Collection\"" is Greek for \""far from everything.\""  The rooms are nice, but far from the center of the action so think \""more walking\"" which is just the thing that everyone wants to do in Vegas.  The other amazing BS was that my room was on the \""61st floor\"" in a building that maybe had 40 floors.",0
"We went here Saturday for dinner. We had a 2-1 coupon. Price was $37 for two people so a good deal. \n\nVery large space, open layout.  Been here a few times years ago. I ate mostly the crab legs. Prime rib. \n\nThey provide a self serve drink area, which I think is good.  You don't have to flag down a staff to get a drink when you want one. We've all been in that situation. \n\nUnlimited alcohol, wines and beer. They have a bar area with one bartender working and a bunch of tv's to watch or get updates on games. \n\nI wouldn't go out of my way, but if I was in Mirage and hungry, I'd eat there if we had another 2-1 coupon. I wouldn't spend full retail price eating there. Other buffets on the strip are better for same price points.",2
"This location is absolutely AWFUL!!! They screw up my order EVERY SINGLE TIME! \n\nThat's if they even get the order in the system.... \nThis morning I ordered breakfast l, sat there for 15 minutes and my order hadn't even been started. \n\nI WILL NOT BE COMING BACK, Managers don't give two shits and employees are close to brain dead. \n\nNOT RECOMMENDED",0
"Service was great, food was great.  Was pleasantly surprised since I had not had a great stay at the hotel.   I had no really low expectations but needed to eat before catching a flight.  Would totally recommend and dine again. We had the mixed trio and the Chilean sea bass, dessert  bread pudding highly recommend",4
"I have eaten at this restaurant three times, and I've had drastically different experiences each time. The first time I ate here, I had the bone marrow (which was actually delicious) and an Indian dish (I have since forgotten the name of it), which has actually been taken off the menu and rightfully so because it tasted like creole and a mockery to Indian cuisine. The second time I came here, I had the pleasure of eating very tasty mussels with a milk stout. My second experience was actually very pleasant, and I do hope to repeat it if I come back. \n\nWhen I came here my third time, I was met with a rude hostess and a bad brunch. As someone who used to be one, I understand that hosting at a restaurant on a weekend can be demanding and difficult. However, the hostess at this restaurant was not busy but also incompetent and rude. When we arrived, she told us that we would have to wait fifteen minutes. Not only did we wait almost an hour, but she was very combative and unapologetic when I asked for a more accurate waiting time. I wasn't expecting an actual apology, but I was met with excuses and an attitude. As said in my bio, I love eggs benedict, but this restaurant has further proven that I cannot find a delicious plate of eggs benedict in Madison; the egg was tough, and the yolk was dry. I find it almost a crime to cut into a benedict and not be met with a delicious, runny yolk. \n\nOverall, I'm impressed by the bone marrow and the mussels, but the brunch left me disappointed. If I come back, I hope I see a friendlier hostess whose attitude doesn't make me want to walk out.",1
"Really liked their ale. For appetizers I tried out pasta fries which had good dipping sauce but pasta fries where so so. Then I had chicken and waffles... Good waffles (sweet and buttery), god green beans....then an ok chicken. Really liked the interiorand its  cleanliness and service. Would come back to try other dishes.",2
"I've gone to Cornish Pasty Co. once a week since the first time I tried it last month.  Believe the hype!! Delicious food, ultra cool comfortable ambience, delicious brew and super nice staff, even if perhaps a little slow sometimes.\n\nSeat yourself and enjoy, I tried the Cottage Pie first, which was good, my hubby ordered the Chicken Pesto, it was great.  Next time around I got the Oggie and there is definitely a reason this is first on their menu, soooooo delicious, like a delicious beef stew in a crust, newbies start here! The Cheesesteak is also soooo delicious, my husband hasn't ventured outside of that one since he first tried it cause he doesn't believe anything will ever taste as delicious. Their fries/chips are okay, and I've only tried their soup with black beans which was tasty and spicy.  definitely save room for dessert because the apple caramel pasty haunts my daydreams, its that good.\n\nUnfortunately my pre-holiday guilt is kicking in so I'm gonna have to cut back to only going every other week so as not to tip the scales soon but I will definitely make my way through their entire menu eventually and report back =)",4
"A big disappointment! The kimchi selection was pathetic, the service was slow and impersonal, and the food are over priced for the quality. Will never go back there again.",0
"Came here for a friend's birthday dinner. It has a cool atmosphere, but it's super expensive and the food is so-so for the price you pay. It's also super dark, so it's hard to read the menus. This is probably to hide that you're paying $45 for a few pieces of steak. \n\nIf you're here at the right time, Treasure Island's pirate show will play right outside your window, so you can listen to the cannons and fireworks go off while you're eating a romantic dinner. That could be a good or bad thing depending on your personality.",2
"My Partner and I just poped into this shop for a warm on a cold february day, no one else in the store but us.\nThe little old lady watched us like a hawk so I asked some questions about hallmarks etc whilst my partner browsed the cabinets.\n\n\n The little old lady knew her stuff and my partner found a beautifull silver celtic style wriste band.\n\n\n Probably the most expensive warming session I have ever had but the banter with the little old lady was great and the quality/price also good.",3
"Love, love, love their fish tacos.  The grilled fish is always fresh and cooked perfectly.  The veggies, especially the tomatoes, are always fresh and ripe.  I am particularly critical of the vegetables when dining out.  Coming from the Midwest, I'm accustomed to great veggies (which you can't always find here in Phoenix - especially tomatoes which can make or break a taco).  I'm not a big fan of fried fish tacos but a friend of mine says they're great.  The Ray Rd. location is super cute with the thatch covered patio and just the right amount of Mexican decor.  It feels authentic, which is a characteristic chain restaurants often struggle with.  The staff is attentive and friendly (and patient with my 5 year old that can never seem to make up her mind)!  Overall great Mexican experience at an affordable price!",3
This place has excellent breakfast. The biscults and gravy are amazing. Fresh coffee. The parking is a little small for full size trucks. Home style breakfast is a speciality here.,4
"I've grabbed dinner to go here a couple times in the past few months. I was excited to find another inexpensive mexican restaurant close to where I live. Most of their food seems pretty salty...I could live with about half the salt and I like a lot of salt But the spicy beef (#9) lived up to it's name. If you like spicy food I'd highly recommend trying the #9. Considering that Amados is just a couple minutes away, I probably won't try this place again.",1
"Cheap? For damn sure! Good? Eh. Good enough when the wallet is a little thin and you still gotta have it. Sorta like a really cheap hooker. They have mostly the standard stuff that won't offend any sushi noobs (the type of folks I usually go to places like this with in the first place because they wouldn't know the difference between this and if JIRO of DREAMS OF SUSHI fame himself were making the sushi). Stuff like maguro, sake (salmon), shrimp, and an endless number of \""rolls\"". They also have cheesecake, cream puffs, and little kiddie drinks like Lamune if you need the sugar fix. They charge by the colors of your plates. I don't remember what the color scheme and pricing chart is but all I know is 2 people can eat till being stuffed for as cheap as 20 bucks. That's Kaitenzushi (revolving sushi) for you. That's gotta mean something in this economy right? That's probably why it's always packed when I go. If you go at some prime time be prepared to write your name on the waiting list and wait 15 minutes or so. Located in a strip mall on the northeast corner of Ray and Priest with McDonald's as a main landmark. Parking is strip mall and Teharu is the only real thing happening there so not a problem.",2
"I went here for a 'nice' steak dinner. however, i think 'nice' is actually 'bleh'.\n\nAll I wanted was a big, fat hunk of delicious meat and some healthy vegetables. Apparently they have vegetables but I wouldn't call them healthy. They have green beans, and I'm sure they are delicious with all the butter and bacon they are cooked in but I am 100% sticking to my New Years resolution. I asked instead if I could have fresh green beans cooked by themselves. My waitress said NO.\n\nNO?! you mean you don't have fresh vegetables?\n\nEverything they have is already premade and nothing is fresh. GROSS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!\n\nThe steak was bland and I pretty much used an entire mound of salt for flavor. It ended up being like $20 bucks after tip. Totally ridiculous. \n\nI don't understand restaurants that don't use fresh vegetables and nothing can be cooked to order. that totally grosses me out. I will not be back. If I was by myself I would have left when I found out nothing was fresh, but I was with people and didn't want to insult them because one of them chose this place?",1
"From an architectural standpoint, the stadium is neither bad nor exciting.  It seems the architects took the safe route.  If you don't do anything particularly unique there is nothing really to hate.  That said, there is nothing really to love.  The stadium is symmetrical along both cardinal axes.\n\nTwo giant Panthers, or as I saw them for the Belk Bowl, Bearcats, guard the major entries to the stadium.\n\nBeer was reasonably priced.  Sight lines are good.",2
"Love The Kitchen Gallery, wonderfully pleasant and knowledgeable staff. Being knowledgeable myself I asked questions to see if I would be pointed in the direction of the most suitable item for my needs or one that would make them more money. Happily they have always helped me find the most economical choice for my needs, and can clearly explain the small perks that can be expected with pricier options. I wish they would carrier more specialty (not available at major bookstores) cookbooks, so it would be one less thing for me to order online. \n**More small specialty baking dishes please**",4
"Hands down, WORST service experience I have had in the last 5 years. The managers in the call center are inept,  with a total lack of knowledge of their own product. All that they want to do is argue with you. Had the pleasure of speaking with Jose today, and he did not know what modem I had...what modem they were offering..what service was available. Save yourself the trouble, time, and money and go with a service that has a true interest in quality and service. We will be looking elsewhere for a provider, as this one is JUST terrible. You would think that after 7 YEARS of being a loyal customer, I would at MINIMUM receive respect when I call in about troubleshooting issues and product quality issues. I would RUN from this company, as fast as you can.",0
"We just tried this place again this weekend, because I really want to like it. The menu is so enticing. However, this was our 3rd time there, and it's been a huge disappointment every time. The inside of the place looks very modern, and the food sounds amazing from the description. However, once you actually taste it, it's hard to believe how disappointing it tastes and how much you just paid. I have been there with my family every time, so I have sampled quite a few dishes. Every single one was a big let down. It's not inedible, but not very good, especially for the price.\n\nThe service has been poor each time, and we had a different server each time, all bad. Each time they have forgotten requests, 2/3 times had to come back to ask what someone ordered, and they are generally inattentive.\n\nWith regard to kids, their kids meals are ridiculous. My daughter got a plate with 3 pancakes nothing else, no meat, fruit or veg. for $6; they weren't even good pancakes. The last time we were there we asked for some fruit for my youngest. We wanted a side order of mixed fruit, and we were asked which fruits we would like. We gave a few that he might like and expected one small bowl of fruit. My 9 month old received each fruit individually in an adult size bowl nearly full, and we were charged individually. An adult couldn't have eaten all the fruit he was given, and the bananas were beyond the point I would have served them.",1
"Anytime I each Filipino food outside of my own or family's own kitchen, I'm always nervous about what surprise im in for.\nIn this case, it was a good treat. Being in an area away from home, I wanted something close to home cooking. The food was good (not the best, but not horrible).   I would come here again",2
We would be lost without Lucky Me Pet Care. Michelle is our Dogsitter. She comes every time we need her so Oliver knows her and loves her. She cares about him and treats him as if he were her own dog. Lucky me is exactly what we are bc of Lucky Me Pet Care!!,4
"Maybe I just had bad luck here, but I wasn't impressed with the food. The service was friendly enough, but the food was worse than other Pittsburgh Thai restaurants I've been to. I probably won't be back.",2
"This is by far the best place to get coffee, espresso, etc. I've been coming here for years. I love the fresh taste of the espresso and the uber friendly service!! I used to live right behind it but we moved and I still will drive completely out of the way to have my coffee from them. Love the chocolate covered espresso bean you get with every drink...puts a smile on my face every time!!",4
"It pains me to lower my rating for Illegal Jack's but it has to be done.\n\nI returned here last week for a friends birthday and while I do enjoy the relaxed surroundings, I came away very disappointed.\n\nSince my last visit, Jack's have done something which puts them in the same boat as companies like Ryanair. They have started doing 'add on's.' So you look at the menu and think yum, I think I will have a Burrito! That is \u00a36.50. Oh wait, you have to add an extra 75p on to that to put beef in your Burrito. That translates as paying \u00a36.50 for a tortilla with some rice and beans. Not cool. Why can't you just buy a Burrito for \u00a36.50? Why not include the beef in the price? I really don't think a tortilla, rice and beans is worth \u00a36.50. Then the sneaky assistant behind the counter asks if you want sour cream and jalapenos, in the same way that they ask what type of salsa and beans you want. There is no mention at the extra cost. Your \u00a36.50 Burrito quickly turns into costing you \u00a310.10 with a cup of coke. \n\nThe Burrito is huge, but you quickly realize it is made up of mostly rice and beans with very little beef. It is all rather tasteless and bland and the realization that it cost over a tenner makes it worse. I want to love this place because the idea is brilliant, but I think the prices do not reflect the quality or flavour of the food.",1
"If this establishment were located anywhere else it would die the death it so much deserves.  We waited for over an hour to be seated only to be served the worse bar food we have ever encountered, it's hard to screw up chicken wings but mcfaddens did a fine job in doing so. Not only was the food bad but we were offered plastic dinner ware because they ran out of the metal forks and knives.\nThere are to many other choices in the area to try,stay away from this place at all cost you'll be glad you did.",0
Wow! A gem and a find. These guys know what they are doing. Got a margarita pizza and it may have been the best I've ever had. The crust was a little chewy but in a flavorful way and the sauce and spices kicked in with subtle timing that speak to their expertise. Great interior and staff. I can't wait to return.,4
"I am going to split my review in several parts. First I would give the hostess when we first arrived no stars. She asked me several times what my name was and if I had a reservation. She finally gave us a table in the front near the door. When we asked for another table she said we could move to a booth in about 15 minutes. We waited almost an hour for the booth and in that time several other people came in and were given other tables in the restaurant.  \n\nOnce we got to our booth Brian our waiter was very attentive. I will give Brian five stars for his service for our entire meal. \n\nThe price of the meal includes sides so a good value for what you get. \n\nI will gave the Chef one star.  There were four of us and we all ordered steaks. Only one out of the four meals was cooked correctly. One steak was ordered as medium, it was well done. My husbands steak was ordered as medium and it was medium rare. My steak was ordered as medium and I got rare.  I sent it back and when they brought it back it was only medium rare.  I told them to redo the whole meal. When they finally brought the new steak it was cooked perfectly. But everyone else had finished their meal so I just had them box it to eat later.\n\nWilliam the asst manager only charged us for two meals so at least they tried to make it right. I am not sure I will come again. Perhaps the regular chef was on vacation last night. Vegas offers many restaurants to choose from.",1
"Love Penzey's!!! What a fun store. Whether you go in with certain spices in mind or just to browse, you're bound to leave with some awesome choices.\n\nMost items come in multiple size options. I am in love with the tiny glass jars. If you use a lot of a certain spice/herb, you can purchase it in a larger bag and jar it yourself if you prefer (empty jars available). There is also a large selection of gift boxes so if you are trying to find a gift for someone who has everything or is difficult to shop for, these are excellent options.\n\nThe only drawback for me is that I don't believe they have any organic options. I didn't expect them to, given the size and that it's a specialty store. It isn't a dealbreaker for me, but for some it could be. Because I prefer to have the choice, I will probably continue to purchase my common spices at places like Whole Foods, but for more uncommon and fun mixes, I will shop here.",3
"What  can I say  about Gordon Ramsay Steak but that we were greatly disappointed.\nWe stepped up and ordered the Hell's Kitchen tasting dinner at $145 per person plus the extra $75 per person charge for wine accompaniments.  Starting with the Scotch Egg, this so called delicacy was smaller than a golf ball. Perhaps the size of a large grape. Tasteless and boring. So we move on to the Spring Vegetable Salad. Now this was about 5 slices of green vegetable matter with a slice of tuna about the size of a postage stamp. Again tasteless and boring. So now it is time for the Mushroom Risotto. This was two tablespoons of Risotto and a nice sized Scallop in the center. This was excellent  but it was laughable to see this served on a large white dinner plate when it would have fit on a tea cup saucer and never even came close to the running off the edge. Ah, now the Beef Wellington. Have you seen the Beef Wellington that is served on Hell's kitchen? Forget about it.  You take one of those pieces you see on TV and cut it in half and serve two! I'm not kidding. Our Beef Wellington was about 3 inches wide by 2 inches high by 2 inches long. I could have had a 22 ounce Rib Eye for $100 less. So now dessert, the blueberry tart. This came with a piece of crust about 3 inches long and  1/2 inch wide. Not a standard tart shaped cup. It had about 8 blueberry's and a tablespoon of vanilla ice cream. It was good, but come on, this is what you get for $145 each? The wine's were about a 3 ounce pour each. A little more than a wine tasting. None of the wines were memorable. Kind of reminded us of what you get at Trader Joe's from the bottom shelf.  So the total bill for Martini's,Hell's Kitchen Tasting Dinner, Wine accompaniment plus tip for two people was just over $600!!! The service was excellent, 5 stars plus so they received their 20% because they earned it. To say we were disappointed is an understatement. We wouldn't go back to Gordon Ramsay Steak even if we had a Groupon!",1
"I like the food, the attitudes of the staff, the d\u00e9cor and the prices.\nTheir crepes are light and fluffy and the fact that they serve fontina cheese is a plus for me.\nThank you very much.",4
"I love this place and it's kind of close to my house so it's even better, this is my staple thai place.  The best deal in vegas for lunch is here, mon-fri 6.99 lunch special.  You get a fried wonton, spring roll and a cup of the soup of the day plus one of like 10 entree choices.  Everything here is delicious and fresh and the people are extremely friendly like most thai joints and thats refreshing compared to the usual crap service you get at most chinese restaurants.  Their pad thai and curries are especially delicious.",3
"C'est une super salle de spectacle qui peut sembler un peu difficile \u00e0 trouver vu son emplacement mais qui est facilement accessible par m\u00e9tro ou m\u00eame en voiture.

Starbucks....need I say more? Caffeine...Im good to go!,2
Love this place. They have unique desserts here considering they have a candy shop within the restaurant as well. Candy bakes pizza to amazing milkshakes. Defiantly a spot to hit up.,4
"The place is clean.   3 guys working there, two guys at counter pretty cool.  One cleaning the tables a total whiner in front of customers.  Got the italian.  Ok its no Subway.  Whoever compared it to Subway is not even close.  The sandwich is like Chompies but WAY SALTY.  I think its in the shaker they shook on it.  Verdict is still out as the salt is still overwelming.   I think I just need to supervise the kids making it.",2
"Decent rooms which were clean and roomy enough.  Desk personnel were helpful and friendly.  Close to the airport however, not many restaurants within walking distance.  Price was a little higher then expected.  I would stay here again.",2
"Okay, so this review is for Luma in Mt. Lebanon... Been there twice now and both times it has been 'just okay'. First time, had the beef tenderloin with pasta in alfredo (something I never get) and it was pretty good. The second time I wasn't sure what to get so I picked an easy one: filet. I ordered it medium, it came out well; the sides of the day were orzo with what seemed like sundried tomato but if was tough to discern the flavor because it had been prepared hours before. The vegetable was a zucchini and yellow squash sauteed in olive oil - undercooked and lacking salt or pepper (a simple dish yet someone was lazy and didn't bother to season it or let it sautee to a put where it was done). Needless to say, for the money I am not going back... Bistro 19 and Il Pizzaiolo are in the same area.",1
"Though the Palazzo shares much in common with the Venetian, the Shoppes are not among them. The Palazzo is far superior in their quality of stores...including Thomas Pink, 7 for all Mankind, and Fresh (some of my favorites). \n\nThe Palazzo is well worth a visit for both the gambling and shopping. A great combination if you actually manage to take some money from the casinos (only to give it back at the shops).",4
"I have had the crappiest exp\u00e9rience h\u00e8re. Arrive at a restaurant with broken AC, I think they should have mentioned that on the phone when we made r\u00e9servations. After we sitting for 25 minutes with menus, no water, and no server we decided to leave. Not the first time this has happened. The menu looked nice, but I'll never know and have absolutely no intention of going back. CRAPPY service is CRAPPY service.",0
"Hmm. I don't really know how to review this place. We came this morning for the champagne brunch with a pretty large party. The line was pretty long, but it went quickly and they were able to seat us relatively fast considering the size of our party. \n\nThere were many pros to this buffet. Once seated, our server quickly took our drink orders and we were able to go get our food. They have a pretty good variety of options and it's organized well. There seemed to be something for everything. The food was ok as well. \n\nNow, onto the con and it's one heck of a con. I unfortunately caught sight of a roach on the line, right on the waffle, biscuit and corned beef hash station and that obviously stopped my appetite in it's tracks. That's unforgivable in my book, I won't be back.",0
"First time I went there was amazing. Then, terrible, then terrible, terrible, then amazing once in awhile.  But I find myself craving it when I pass by it for some reasons...so I go back. It is really affordable and I do prefer their tacos to 3 amigos, but I'm not a big Mexican food eater so I can only go by my own preferences.",2
"This bigger-than-it-looks restaurant is near my wife's office. We've passed by it so many times, but while we were out and about in the area on a day off we decided to stop in instead. We're very glad we did.\n\nWe were told up front there'd be about a 10 minute wait. Might have been that long, but I'm really not sure. While we were waiting, we were just so fascinated watching the staff work it just didn't matter. Once seated, we were greeted quickly by our server who got us fresh squeezed orange juice (we watched it being squeezed before we sat down) and coffee.\n\nWe both ordered the whole hog skillet (bacon, sausage, and ham on hash browns with eggs cooked to order). She had egg whites and a side of toast. I had eggs over easy and a side of pancakes, their signature dish. While the skillets were both great, the pancakes were even better. They were the lightest and fluffiest we've ever had.\n\nService was exceptional and the efficiency of the staff in turning over tables and serving food and drinks prompted us to pull the manager aside to compliment the crew. Eating here was a great start to a fun day.\n\nEdited November 11, 2013: Five star review drops to three.\n\n\""No substitutions.\""\n\nIn very tiny print at the bottom of their menu are the above two words. Today, my wife ordered breakfast to go which she's done many times. This time she asked for oatmeal with banana and cranberries, but wanted blueberries instead of cranberries. It was the first substitution she's asked for from them. She didn't see the very tiny print forbidding such a thing.\n\nThe person on the phone told her in no uncertain terms that they didn't do substitutions. Then, she backtracked. Seems they actually do substitutions if you're willing to pay an extra couple of dollars.\n\nNow, that might not seem like much, but let's take a look at what she wanted to do.\n\nSubstitute blueberries for cranberries.\n\nThat's it.\n\nThese are reasonably comparable products as far as price goes.\n\nThere's no extra effort involved in using blueberries instead of cranberries aside from the person in the kitchen mixing the berries into the oatmeal having to pay attention to the order ticket.\n\nSo, why in the world does it cost $2.00 to to make such a substitution?\n\nThe only thing I can think of is the folks at Butters think so much of themselves and their exquisite taste in food combinations that to deign to stoop to the uneducated whims of their customers, they must penalize us for our horrid taste.\n\nAs high quality as their food and service generally are, I personally won't set foot in their restaurant again. I don't feel the need to pay extra to someone to insult me.",2
"Worst. Bar. Ever. Find someone to buy you a pint of crappy Canadian whiskey, and then take your money to Espresso Royale and give them the business whilst drinking on the sly. Now.",0
"It isn't anything spectacular but it isn't terrible either. Sometimes the food is a little extra crispy and sometimes it is just right. I would give it 4 stars but really must give it 3 because it isn't consistent every time and certain things have been questionable. I will say this though, IHOP is right across the street but I would defiantly choose this place over them any day. That still doesn't say a whole lot about this place.\n\nI usually order waffles. If it isn't overcooked it is very tasty. I tried the chicken and waffles once but the chicken just seems like a frozen chicken finger they nuked and put on top.  The eggs are usually the only thing cooked perfect and they do taste good. I have asked for sides before such as extra ranch or mayo and gotten weird extras in the cup it was brought in. \n\nBasically, this place isn't bad every once in a while but to take family and friends I would go t Rachel's Kitchen or up to Bagel Cafe. I get a coupon every now and then in the mail and that is when I generally eat there.",2
"I think State Street Brats is a pretty decent place to enjoy some brats and cheese curds downtown. While their cheese curds don't quite compare to some other establishments around town, they'll definitely suffice. I love the selection in brats and burgers that are available and try to select a new item each time I go. Never have been disappointed yet!! Perhaps the Yelp deal aided in my great review but where else can you feed two adults for 10.98 anymore??",3
Overpriced... The rolls kept falling apart and the flavor was not there. The albacore did not taste as fresh as I would've hoped. Definitely had better sushi. Probably wouldn't go back.,1
"Les meilleurs frites de Montr\u00e9al, un restaurant vraiment sympa... \nPlus cher qu'un Fast food, mais tr\u00e8s abordable et d'une qualit\u00e9 excellente...\n\n\n Esp\u00e8re vraiment que cette franchise d\u00e9barque un jour \u00e0 Paris",3
If you could roll up most of Rodeo Drive into a shopping mall then this would be the place.  Unfortunately there really isn't much else but high end stores.  \n\nIt can also be slightly clunky to get through every corner of the mall.\n\nBring cash...plastic can be dangerous!,2
"When it comes to sushi, I love exploring the variety of rolls and taking my tastebuds on incredible journeys. That being said, this place was friendly, clean, decently priced, and tasted fine. \n\nBut there was some pizzazz lacking. The roles were fairly standard with few options of real raw fish (lots of crab and shrimp options). Plus, I was also hard pressed to find many options without mayonnaise based sauces.\n\nHowever, I tried handrolls for the first time and they were delicious! The Unagi handroll and the No Name Handroll were both superb! \n\nGiven the wide variety of sushi joints in the area, this one was not for me. But I will recommend it to all my friends who love good California rolls and Handrolls. The fish was fresh and the service was fantastic! Plus, a friend of mine swears by their Udon soups!",2
"Five stars on the pizza-its just like NY. Thin, crispy, lots of olive oil- The service could be friendlier though. It gives off a vibe of annoyance and no appreciation.  Ive seen people saying maybe thats how it is in NY but I lived in Brooklyn thirty years and people are actually gregarious and friendly.  The pizza is great here so that's my only complaint but it's important to customers to feel valued.",3
We decided to come here on homecoming night. It was super busy and had to wait 45 minutes. But our server was wonderful!! He brought extra bread sticks to our table when we told him we loved bread sticks. Despite the busy restaurant he made sure we had everything we needed and our food was just right! Jamell is a great server and did a wonderful job under hectic circumstances! Thank You!,4
"We stopped here during one of our many Old Town Scottsdale bar crawls. Imagine at least 50 people dressed in Santa (reindeer, snowmen, Mr. and Mrs. Claus) suits invading this place. \n\nMany of our friends rode the mechanical bull to loud cheers from the crowd. One of my friends was lucky enoguh to meet and flirt with the manager. She was treated to a huge yellow cotton candy feast and a dish of blueberries. I should be so lucky.\n\nSaddle Ranch has a large interior with an outdoor patio (for the smokers, but not for the people who want fresh air because of the stinkin' smokers).\n\nWe'll be back, so stay tuned for the next bar crawl and our crazy antics. You should be so lucky.",3
"I've always felt like the Biltmore is overrated. It's a money maker by it's name, not quality. Rooms are mediocre, and although the interesting architecture is a plus, it's gray and I felt like I was in a castle or something...which is cool, when you're not expecting a five star resort.",2
"We went with a group of 7 to Border Grill on the 4h of July. Our service was excellent, Paris did an amazing job. Food and drinks were good, but nothing amazing. The best part was the server and chips and salsa!",2
"I'm an early bird by nature and scheduling. Lunch and dinner are always early on the weekdays. My lunch hour is usually 11-12.  It can be hit and miss at times for that reason, because some restaurants will use \""yesterday's\"" food when they first open for the day. Not this place. They proudly boast on their website that everything is fresh everyday and I do believe that. But why only a 3 star rating? Here we go...\n\nI was seated quickly with only a few other customers present. I was given chips & salsa, ordered a drink, and was given time to study the menu, which is pretty extensive. I ordered a lunch portion of the chimichaga (that's usually my Mexican restaurant gauge-not too hard to screw that up) but waited what felt like forever and a day to get my sweet tea. I had been eating on the chips & salsa and swallowed wrong at one point and didn't have my nectar to help me out. The tea finally came and saved the day. My meal came pretty quickly after wards and I was astonished at the size of this thing.\n\nI feel like I should break down my meal: Sweet tea was meh. Chips & salsa were pretty good but I wasn't all that impressed. Chips had a good crunch but even with the season-salt on board, they weren't all that flavorful. The salsa had a good taste but I like mine a little bit on the thicker side so it doesn't run off the sides of the chip too much. The chimichanga as I said before was a mammoth. I made the mistake of ordering it with steak instead of chicken because I had read on other reviews that the steak in this joint had a good flavor. Not on this particular item. Nothing a little salt...well nothing like a little salt and the rest of my salsa couldn't take care of. Beans and rice were bueno. I found myself mixing everything together into a pseudo-stew to help enhance the flavor of my chimi because I was a bit disappointed in it being so bland. Still, a pretty decent meal at a little over $8 for lunch.\n\nI do intend on making a return-visit here and will try something else, particularly some Friday when the jumbo margaritas are only $5! Yeah, I will drink that mutha and go back to work, no problemo. Maybe with the right meal and a little buzz, I can give an update with another star or two.\n\nYour pal,\nWalter",2
"ok, well I have actually tried this place.  The service was a disaster, but I'll give them a break because I assume they are just getting into the swing of things.  My beer came with my meal at least half an hour after ordering, and my salad was not what I had ordered.  They didn't offer to remake it, but later when I asked him to remake it, it was done rather quickly.  Overall though I was intrigued by the place, and will def. go back to try the burgers, but I think I'll wait a couple weeks so they can work out the kinks.  The salad I had was cheap, but beware they can be quite salty.  I think burgers are def. the way to go here (duh).  The onion strings had good flavor but had to be eaten with a fork because they were so small and crushed.\n\nUPDATE-  I got a takeout burger so that I could try their food without having to deal with the bad service-  Can you believe that the service almost ruined my takeout experience??  They told me the food would be ready in 6 minutes.  I show up 15 minutes later and the food is not ready.  I waited a few more minutes and asked about the food and was basically told to piss off.  30 mins later I had a burger and thirst for blood.  No one apologized.  What assholes (did I mention I recognized a few of them as degenerates from high school?).  Oh, and this was 3:30 on a Monday when there were only a handful of customers (and the burger wasn't anything special).",1
"Online order was not ready. Hell, it didn't even get started til I walked in and asked for it. \n\nI asked for sour cream on the side but it was blopped in the bowl.  When the cashier asked the guy who made it if the sour cream was on the side like the order asked, he simply answered, \""uh, I guess we'll find out\"". SERIOUSLY!?!? Fantastic service.",1
"Huge line to get in at 5:30 on a Saturday night (they open at 4).  Unclear service arrangements, small menu, accordeon player.  Located in a small mall not far from the other German restaurant in Mesa.  Not Germany but an ok substitute.",2
"Enjoyed an evening with friends here last Friday night. I mostly enjoyed the live band, the pub-like atmosphere, and the stiff drinks. It was not all that busy, service was a little on the slow side, and their outdoor patio needs a little work. Overall it's comfortable and feels like a neighborhood bar. I will re-review once I have tried the food.",2
"I was coming home from college for the weekend and my dad asked where I wanted to go when he picked me up from the airport and I told him to surprise me. He definitely picked a good place! I got the short rib tacos and my dad got the ahi tacos. Both were cooked perfectly and absolutely delicious, and the kale salad that came on the side didn't disappoint! My short rib tacos were definitely better between the two though! I'm a little bummed that I didn't order the side of mac n cheese, but I will definitely be back to try it. I also didn't have room for a whole dessert but I ate one of the free co okies on the way out and it was so good that I wish I had grabbed another one before I left.",2
"The \""white\"" cafe's got its good points in Atmosphere, Service, and Food\n\nAtmosphere:  Cafe Nocochi's has two prime attractions, it's location / decor and its pastries.  Nocochi is located on the conner of Sherbrooke and MacKay streets, right along the line of the high-end arts area of Sherbrooke street, which harks back to day when that area of Montreal used to be called the Golden Mile due to the riches it housed.  The decor is simple, clean, and egg-shell white (hence its nickname).  Very comfy seating, and arranged in such a way that conversations can still be intimate despite the relatively small size of the cafe.\n\nService:  Service is ok at cafe Nocochi.  Staff is usually made up of the local student population (Concordia University), and they tend to be pleasant and polite.  In truth, however, not much service is required aside from the staff bring orders to the tables, thus minimal interaction with the staff further solidifies the ambiance as a place one goes for a quite time!\n\nFood:  Nothing special here - standard issue cafe menu is on offer with a selection of sandwiches, small pizzas etc.  Sometimes a hit and miss, depending on the cook's effort of the day, but most often there are more hits than misses.  Go to Nocochi for a  quite cup of coffee / tea and to sample their pastries (Iranian / French).  This is the biggest reason why you should visit.  They also sell their pastries to go in elaborate boxes and combinations, and these make for a terrific gift at the last minute.  A little pricy, but their presentation and taste gives them an aura of value that is always appreciated.\n\nfor a quite, tranquil time ~ a good place.",2
A few weeks ago my daughter and her friends came to visit Vegas. We have tried a few other pt's around the area and the experience was great. We decided to go to this pt' on rainbow since it was closest to the house. The lady bartender was the worst. She completely ignored us and stuck to her usual customers. The busboy was more helpful. We made sure she got no tips and we gave the tip to the busboy instead. Tip to the lady bartender- be friendly and courteous to all that walks in that door. It pays your salary. It doesn't hurt to smile.,0
"As a disclaimer I have to say that I'm a regular at the family of restaurants that brought this gem to this awesome neighborhood, so I'll try to report just the facts.\n\nThe decor and ambience is awesome. The detail of projecting a movie in the brick wall gives the place a unique charm.\n\nThe food was as good as the location in Tempe which from my point of view is awesome. This restaurant is my daughter's favorite place as well and believe me, she's not shy to tell what she thinks!\n\nThe massive bar is the perfect place to have a drink or a nice conversation with a friend (or date).\n\nThe wine list is great and balanced with a little bit of everything to please all kinds of tastes.\n\nDid I mention that the prices are great? Just like the location in Tempe, you couldn't do any better with twice of the money. \n\nYes, I have to admit it, I just LOVE la Bocca.\n\nCheers!\n\nPS it's sister location across the street is awesome as well (Modern Margarita). I could live the rest of my life going back and forth from one place to the other.",4
"We had extremely bad service. Our waitress had no idea what she was doing. I had to correct my order with her multiple times. We did the 2 for 35 (which is an awesome deal) 2 margaritas, an appetizer, 2 entrees, and a dessert. We waited about 40 minutes just to get our appetizer of chips and guac. Very shortly after our fajitas came out & my skillet was barely even warm. The food got cold enough to the point where I didn't even want to eat it after only a few minutes. Then the waitress takes about a half hour to even come check on us.. when she finally does she brings the check without taking the dessert order (which was included on the meal bundle) When I reminded her of the dessert.. We waited about 30 more minutes to receive that. The only reason I give this place 2 stars is because a nice young man took over for our waitress momentarily and refilled our water glasses (for the first time all night, I'll add) and checked on our order because he noticed we were waiting for a while.",1
"I have been wanting to try In-N-Out forever. On my recent trip to Las Vegas I made forever into now. It was everything I had ever dreamed of since I heard 2Pac rap about it back in the '90s, not to mention my partner in crime has gone on and on about them too. This finally came to fruition after walking about two miles and then also almost getting hit by a car (apparently crosswalks mean nothing in Vegas).\n\nI had the double double, animal style, with fries, animal style and a lemonade. Absolutely amazing. The burgers were so much better than anticipated. I was so glad I finally got to try it. It sucks so hard there are none back here in Chicago. The animal style really adds a lot of flavor to an already very tasty burger. The wait was a bit long, though there were a ton of people in there. It has a very '50s atmosphere that brings a little bit extra awesome to eating at boring old fast food places. The fries were really good too. This was confirmed by my vegetarian that accompanied us. He also had the naked burger which is just like a grilled cheese with all the toppings on it. He said that was alright, but really enjoyed the fries. Nice and crispy, and hot too.\n\nAll in all this was everything I wanted. And it really makes me regret not living out west as we could have it all the time. Ugh, I want some nowwwww.",4
"Trash can for the kitchen. .   What to pick!\n\nSimplehuman (I think it is referring to my husband, HA)  is the only brand I saw there.  We had a stain steel trash can and our dog loves.  He can step on the foot level and he can go through the trash.  We loved the stain steel ones but they did not have a pet lock.  Only the black matted style had it, so got it.  We are happy but our dog is not.  =)",3
"Burger was average at best, certainly nothing spectacular.  Customer Service was down right pathetic.  We asked for our order to go since they were already stacking chairs at 7:30pm and got home to find out we were one burger short.  Called back and were told there was nothing they would do about it tonight since they closed at eight and offered to credit us one burger as if they were doing us a favor!  We paid for the darn burger and didn't get it!  I called back and let them know I wasn't satisfied with that...  I was shocked that he argued that he felt crediting us what we paid for was sufficient.  After all, my husband and I had to share a burger for dinner, became defensive and asked what I wanted.  I felt he should comp a dinner.  No way..\n\nThe floors were sticky in places and greasy in other places.  Ultimately, we were told they would credit 2 burgers - the one we paid for and one free.  Don't want to eat there again though - I will definitely be visiting a manager and getting my $7.99 back for the burger we paid for and didn't get - not worth going back to eat for sure!",0

"This place was sooo disappointing!!! I am highly confused on the rave reviews.\n\nJust to let everyone know It takes a lot to get a bad review from me. I usually give places the benefit of the doubt. And I was SO hoping this place would be amazing. \n\nBut it sucked! \nFirst off it is located in a beautiful location right on the lake. But as we were walking up we couldn't sit outside because there was garbage everywhere! And I mean everywhere the ground in front of the door, all over the 2 tables. Not a big deal because we could just sit inside but when we got in it was confusing. Is it a self serve cafe or restaurant? the decor is funky there are a few tables strewed around and to the side there is a mini store (just shelves). \n\nI finally had to ask if we should seat ourselves to which our rude \""waitress\"" if you call her that.. told us to pick a seat. After 15-20 min she came up and asked us what we would like to drink. By then we already knew what we wanted and started to order. She looked at us very strangely and walked away. I was under the impression thats how we ordered considering she ordered our drinks...\n\nI ordered the Beet Burger..and my boyfriend ordered the loaf i think.. \nThe food was eh'. Considering the price I expected a little more but it was fine. After we had finished..30 minutes later she finally came back and gave us our check. This was also confusing because there was a bar to order things and a mini cash register on the side. We were not sure if we were to pay there or to her. So i just assumed we pay up front. We waited for 15 minutes while the woman talked to another woman about some products. \n\nThis place has so much potential. Especially because there are not many raw/vegan restaurants here in Vegas.\n\nSave yourself the time..",1

During my first 2 visits this week, there was never an issue with using a debit card. No one ever mentioned it (I don't carry cash. I know, I know, save the lecture). \nToday I went to buy my 2.22 cup of coffee the cashier rudely told me there was a $3 min. I told her I had been in 2 other times this week and no one had told me that. She then moved a plastic display to show me a small sign taped to the cash register. Swell, I thought. Welp. I have no cash and I am not buying a donut.

I've played this golf course ever week with a bunch of friends. The course is good  and the restaurant is great. The customer service in the pro shop is terrible. I'm handy capped and have to carry the clubs from my car to the cart because the cart can't be driven to the vehicle area. They start you off on the back nine  bunching up golfers when there is no one playing on the front nine. I've played here at least 20 times because of friends but I will not spend my money here again. Find a more friendly golf course unless you like bad customer service.,1

"Apparently all it takes is a well known name to make the crowds flock and \""ohh and ahh\"" over a building. For a Frank Lloyd Wright building, the Monona Terrace is not at all spectacular. In comparison to works such as Fallingwater, the Monona Terrace is nothing more than a typical community center with awkwardly placed bathrooms and lots of escalators. The convention center relies heavily on the Wright's name to draw interest, and has dedicated large portions of the interior to pictures and plaques depicting him and his life.\n\nWhile the exterior mimics the fluidity of the two lakes between which it sits, the inside is stifling and lacks a natural feeling. There is a distinct rigidity inside, that seems unnatural when paired against the view of the lake from the big glass windows. The carpets are a burnt orange/red color, and the conference rooms are small. Once filled, the tables and bodies are akin to sardines stacked neatly on top of one another. The rooftop offers some views worth taking in, once you get away from the tables and the areas being set up for special events. \n\nThe convention center does not permit outside food, except for wedding cakes. So the food was hit or miss. Potatoes were served with just about every meal, mostly as \""salad\"" (which was odd when paired with Mexican styled foods). No bottles of water were made available, the most convenient beverages were cans of soda. \n\nService as a whole was odd. Wait staff barely allowed plates to near empty before swooping in. The bartenders, however, rocked. They were friendly, chatty, and they were great with remembering faces and desired beverages. Only once during my four days in the building did I see anyone representing the building other than wait staff.\n\nAs a whole - I was not impressed with the Monona Terrace, this \""beautiful\"" building that I had heard so much about... If anything, it distracts from the natural beauty of Lake Monona.",2

NICE! Stick to a dress code Las Vegas!!!  Lets keep it classy for a change. You won my forever fan ship Bonefish Grill!",4
"We looked all over the place for a new dentist in Tempe.  And as luck would have it we stumbled upon Gentle Care Dental.  Our very first visit we were so pleased that they saw me and my wife, and then made special accommodation for my 3 year old daughter who needed a crown on her baby tooth.  They said, 'let's bring her on back and see how it goes' and she felt very comfortable, so instead of looking all over the place for a specialty 'pediatric dentist' this place is now our one stop place for the whole family.   They just alway have been so extremely accommodating to a busy family's needs, and make my kids feel comfortable and well taken care of.  The front staff is very easy to work with and makes you feel good, and Cheryl is most knowledgable about insurance and such other things.  The dental assistants who do the cleanings are among the best I've ever experienced.  The setup is extremely modern, and the x-rays are about ten times higher resolution than my previous dentist.  Dr. Barela, he is super professional and I put my faith in him.  Plus, they have hot tea and a nice waiting room and good magazines :-)  Way to go Gentle Care Dental!",4
Absolutely pathetic service! \n\nWTH is wrong with this chain? They all suck so bad  and continually set the low standard for fast food  service and consistency.,0
"Wow...Not only does this place prepare delicious thai food, but they happily prepare delicous VEGAN thai food, at your request. 5 stars for bringing a touch of veganism to the West Valley!!! Their menu denotes that many items can be made vegan. How refreshing. The service was A+, waiters very accommodating and attentive. I got the fried tofu appetizer which was by far the best fried tofu i've ever had at a thai restaurant. I also got the Vegetable Pad See Ew (sp?) as a main entree that was absolutely delicious...wine was excellent as well. Loved the upscale decor and atmosphere (thank you for bringing some class to the West Valley -- a refreshing change from all the run of the mill chain restaurants. I will be back again and again.",4
"I liked it, didn't LOVE it.\n\nMy date and I (which was great btw) decided to go there, because I've just been dying to try this place.\n\nHe got the shawarma, which was good -- just different -- it had curry powder on it -- which I love.  The hummus that came with it, was sort of cloying -- it needed a bit more lemon juice or something.  It was a little too pasty.\n\nI got the kabob -- which isn't like normal kebabs -- mean and veggies grilled on a stick.  It was ground beef that had spices and stuff in it.  The flavor was good, but the consistency was sorta rubbery.\n\nWe both got two falafel each -- they say they are famous for them.  They were good, but they weren't anything to do cartwheels over, either.  Honestly, they wouldn't have been all that interesting without the tahini on the side.\n\nThe prices were good -- but it's sort of a drag that they sell no booze.  A glass of wine *may* have made this a better experience.  \n\nI'll just keep going to Elie's Deli for my Middle Eastern food fixes!",2
"Excellent service. Staff was really nice and friendly and they support the military( gave 20% discount for military off their already cheap prices). I would come here again! Their crust isn't necessarily the best I've had but, based on how it looked out of the oven, it was pretty damn good and unique. They give a heavy portion of sauce, which I like, so if you're not big on sauce order light on the sauce. Overall the sauce is very good. All in all I say it's the best pizza around the Aliante area, so pop in and give it a try. I'll definitely be back!",3
"This was my very first visit to a vegan restaurant. I was so thrilled to come here, I couldn't contain myself. The employees were nice, but they were busy. The people in the restaurant seemed a bit snobby, but I shouldn't care about them anyway. I am there to eat, not make friends. \n\nI was overwhelmed with choices. I went for the buffalo wings and the spicy chicken po' boy sandwich. My boyfriend got the Green Veggie Burger, and his sister got the no-harm chicken parm. We are vegan, she is not.\n\nThe wings were by far my favorite! I think I will order them as a meal or to share though. Some reviews said the portion was small, but I couldn't finish them despite how delicious they were. My sandwich was pleasantly messy and delicious. The texture is truly fabulous as far as faux meat goes. Don't come here expecting gardein textures and flavors - it is the best of the best! \n\nA lot of people said it was greasy and oily. I am familiar with a low-fat diet and usually eat as low-fat as possible. Even though this is not health food (unless you get the healthier options), it doesn't feel heavy or disgusting like traditional SAD food does. There is a noticeable difference. The salt level could be taken down a notch, but other than that, this food is AMAZING. \n\nAfter going to Vegas and trying vegan food at restaurants here, Green is still winning as far as value and quality goes. I can't wait to go back, and Green will certainly be on my mind for awhile.",4
"This is not the Big Apple from my childhood. I have tried this place twice in 8 years, they ran out of ribs the first time and food was just not good the second.....waitress was cool and a bit cooky, couldn't make up for the meal though.",1
ok service. rice was dry.  then once i came got home i had it coming back... from both ends.  WILL NOT BE BACK,0
"I would actually give it 2.5 because it does not meet the standards \nof any RESORT we've ever stayed in (we stay in Resorts 2-3 times a year).\nIt does not have a restaurant.   Both swimming pools are to one end of the property making it inconvenient for most guests.  Dose not have attractive grounds. It's in the middle of a business district (not retail shops) but it is easy access to a freeway and close for shopping, restaurants and grocery store.\n\nThe units are nice and roomy and the 2 bedroom unit has laundry facilities.  \n\nOur problem was that al the living room furniture (love seat & 2 chairs) were very uncomfortable, with no lumbar support.  Using the pillows from the bed helped but\nnot as much as we would have liked.  Towels were a bit rough.  \n\nStaff was friendly and maintenance took care of a couple of problems we had.  They also offered us another unit but we chose to stay and wait for parts that needed to be ordered.  \n\nApprox. 10 miles to nice mall, Old Town, Civic Center (beautiful!!!) and other districts.",1
"NOTE: Cafe Wasabi only gets four stars if you keep it simple. Stick with the fundamentals and stay out of the more...interesting rolls and you will get great value for money.\n\nNo nonsense, decent quality, decent speed. I actually like the place most because it treats sushi like what sushi is supposed to be: a convenient, simple finger food. Too many Americanized sushi places dress up the rolls and the experience too much - and charge for the unnecessary embellishment.",3
"After reading a few yelp reviews I hesitated in going to this location, but still gave it a chance because it's the closest yo my home...I have to say the service was GREAT! Jade was our server (we sat in the bar area), she was quick, friendly, approachable and attentive.  \n\nSo I wanted to drop in and write a review to offset some of the \""bad service\"" reviews placed on here.  The food hasn't changed..chicken gud ....and it's even better when it's wing Tuesday (can't beat that price!) So with that, I gave the place 4 stars!   I'm very stingy with my 5s :).",3
"This is my favorite Japanese SteakHouse/Sushi Bar all in one in Charlotte. Everything is awesome. The Hibachi grill food, Edamame, Seaweed Salad, misho soup are awesome. The Sushi Bar is the best. Dragon Roll, Eel and cucumber roll, Yellowtail w/ Scallion Roll, and The Nigiri Sushi(w/ rice) are awesome. Love the staff too!",4
"I have had to endure this place twice now, once by choice and once by obligation.  The good:  skate floor seems in good repair and the rental skates are plentiful and in ok shape.  The bad: stinks, unfriendly staff, dirty tables and not much side wall to help out beginners.  \n\nIn general, it's much like I remember of rinks from the 80's.  Nothing new here.",1
"A stone's throw from our house, would have been such a lovely local place for us to go to. Unfortunately, we were treated with utter contempt by the owner; suspect she thought we were tourists, or worse still, there was a racist aspect to her manner. Who knows, but we have not been back since. And never will....",0
"My husband and I were very disappointed after our most recent trip to this location. My husband received a coupon via email for $14 off an oil change. He called yesterday and asked if he had to print it out or of he could just bring in his phone. They told him he could show it on his phone, and then my husband informed them he'd be in the next day to redeem it. They said okay. So fast forward to today (1/24). My husband shows the guy the coupon when he went to pay, and the guy said he wouldn't accept it because they were already running a $10 off deal. Obviously we knew we weren't going to get $14 off the already discounted price, so we just asked him to price it at regular price then give us the $14 off since our coupon was worth more. He didn't budge. We had another coupon for 15% of the other services they did but they still wouldn't take it. So I'm angry for two reasons: 1) our coupons were completely invalid when they shouldn't have been and 2) nobody told my husband that he couldn't use it when he called about it yesterday. Although it was only 4 dollars, it's really the principle. We didn't even get an apology for this inconvenience. Pretty poor customer service on their behalf. These guys have officially lost two regular customers over this. I hope the 4 bucks was worth it, Jiffy Lube!",0
"This place was phenomenal, the food was amazing. They catered to me which was amazing. I can't handle spicy food and they took that into great consideration when I asked what they had that was not only low on spiciness but also vegetarian. I thoroughly enjoyed my meal there.",4
"Good portion of food for the price.  However, their salad lacks substance and dressing blend.  Their meat is cooked well (a bit dry) but lack any kind of flavor.  It doesn't seem like they marinate their meat.  Even rice lack flavor.  I have had better...much better Greek food for that price.  Not going back.",1
one of the nicest hotels in the city. waitresses come around alot and everyone is very freindly. make sure you sign up for a m card.,3
"Oh man was this place nasty. I went with a group of friends for a weekday dinner buffet (on a Thursday night). NONE of us found anything that we liked to eat and we left feeling unsatisfied and not even full! A lot of the food tasted over-salted but it was especially noticeable in the crab legs. It was nice that they were pre-cut, but was it really necessary to pour a whole shaker of salt on it?? \n\nOne of my friends unfortunately got food poisoning at the buffet, most likely from the sushi (the only thing he ate that we didn't) which spoiled our evening because he needed to be near a bathroom.\n\nI was VERY upset at their dessert selection. All of the cream/mousses tasted watered down, everything had the wrong texture or taste and there was only one decent dessert. It was this nutella in a cone with some orange on it. But it is pretty hard to go wrong when there's nutella. \n\nEven though the price was decent for a dinner buffet, with other buffet options available in vegas, Bellagio's dinner buffet is definitely not worth trying.",0
"Because of the good yelp reviews, my wife and I decided to try this joint out.  It is just a whole in the wall.  There was no one else inside when we showed up around 7 15 on Saturday night.  I ordered three tacos--chicken, fish, and steak.  My wife ordered chicken enchiladas.  We got it to go and it was ready in about ten minutes.\nWe got home and were excited to try our food.  Unfortunately everything was under par except the chips and salsa.  The chicken and steak were a little over cooked. Flavors ok, but nothing amazing.  Enchiladas were just ok. The beans tasted like they were from a can.  My tacos were a little bland.  Really, nothing was great.  \nI really wanted this place to be great.  I'm always rooting for little places like this...but I cant tell people to go here over Carolina's.  Cheap food and cheap taste.  Maybe other items on the menu are good...but I don't think I'll be going back to see.  Good luck taqueria Los Angeles.",1
"I had brunch at E2 a few months ago and, all in all, I wasn't too impressed. In light of yesterday's Post-Gazette review of their dinner offerings, I tried it again. The hostess/waitress, Lauren, was very helpful and welcoming. Other than a large group near the window(s), my friend and I were the only other individuals int he restaurant. As a result, we sat towards the back and we cozy and warm on a snowy winter's night (contrary to the complaints of the establishment being chilly). First off, it's BYOB. : ) The OMGs (i.e. tapas plates) intrigued me. So, I selected the white beans and, for $3, I received about 1/8 of a can of flavorless mushy white beans. The grilled bread was good and in endless supply. I had the mixed greens salad (with beets and gorgonzola) and it was great. I also had the mushroom arancini, a ball of mushrooms, risotto, and mozzarella rolled in panko bread crumbs and flash fried. In a word: DELICIOUS! For dessert, my friend and I tried the Meyer lemon mess. While the citrus was a welcome contrast to the snow outside, it was smothered in whipped cream and a little basic. Both my friend and I gave this place a 6 (out of 10). It's a nice place for din-din during the week, but I would NOT wait to be seated here on a Friday or Saturday night...there are too many better restaurants in Pittsburgh.",2
"Getting a good deal was definitely a plus. The rooms are clean and beds are very comfortable. The casino is adequate some nice staff, some boring staff, and a few simply rude. The latter lost one of the stars in my review. A cool mix of patrons. I'll have to think about coming back. Being a cigar smoker, I find it weird that places that allow cigar smoking at tables have dealers that demonstrate displeasure when I light a stogy up. If that is the consensus, simply change the rule to no smoking and most of us cigar smokers will understand. But I don't like to be made uncomfortable about this. When I sit down at a table I would like to be able to relax. Cigar helps that, especially after you drop a 1000.",2
"Phoenix Municipal Stadium is an appropriate home for the Spring Training Oakland Athletics, as it has the same \""old school\"" feel as the Oakland Coliseum: a basic slab of concrete with green seats, priced somewhat cheaper than other stadiums.   The stadium is rather small compared to the Giants monstrousity in Scottsdale, thus you can actually get \""bleacher seats\"" that are close to First or Third base.\n\nThe games I went to this season had pleasant baseball weather, tho some not-so-pleasant baseball fans who mercilessly heckled all the rookies, as well as any fans who would happen to drop a foul ball.  Fortunately, no nazi security guards here:  one can bring your own food into to park and sealed bottles of water.  Happily, they go by the honor system and just asked me \""You have sealed water bottles in here, right?\"" as they fondled my bag and let me pass.\n\nHowever, don't talk to your friends while the Star Spangled Banner is playing, or you'll get \""SHUSHED\"" by your elders, as I did.",3
"I've been to LV nails twice, and I love love love love it. So clean, so professional, and amazing work. I love the new management, and their quality assurance. They make sure the customers are always taken care of. Highly recommend this place. Thanks Amy for remembering me and my friend after 1 visit. :0) and thanks Lily for the outstanding job on my faded nails.",4
"Food was up to par today. My last experience was mediocre and still decided to give this place another try. We ended up with the same unfriendly and rude bartender.  It was like once he realized we were only doing margaritas and an appetizer, we were not worth his time. I had to walk up to the bar to get my food warmed up and had to wait 10-15 mins to get a refill on salsa after I initially requested it. It also took him another 10 mins or so to bring the bill after I initially requested it. He didn't have a problem stopping at other tables within the bar area to make small talk, provide refills or tabs to the two other occupied tables. If he was overwhelmed my advice would be to get an actual server in the bar area and he could stick to making drinks.",1
Made a reservation for 8:15 last night at Cioppino.  We arrived at 8:15 and were told that our table wasn't ready yet.  They asked us to wait in the bar so my husband ordered a drink. That was the last contact that was made with us until 9:00 when we told them that we were going to another restaurant.  Then the hostess told us that our table was ready. Really??  Then why hadn't anyone come to find us?  They didn't apologize once for our 45 minute wait. They just acted surprised when we said that we were leaving. \nHow is the food.  We 'll never know because we won't be back. Our first impression was enough for us to know that this is not our kind of place.,0
"We've been going to the Great Dane for years. We enjoy their food, but we encountered a hostess today that really made our experience unpleasant. We went specifically to dine in the outside garden. When we got there about half the tables were occupied. Some of the vacant tables were in the direct sun, some were either in the shade or had umbrellas. She wanted to seat us in the direct sun, and when we requested shade, she told us that because there were only two of us, those tables weren't availabe (despite at least one deuce being in the shade). She went back and studied her seating chart for awhile, like she was really being inconvenienced, and finally sat us at a table that was only partially in the sun. The food was good, our server was excellent, but when you begin the experience being told that you're not really valued because there are only two of you, it really detracts! (BTW, the vacant tables stayed vacant the entire time we were there.)",1
"If someone rates this less than a 4 then they probably should not be grading a fine dining restaurant.  \n\nBlue has an excellent atmosphere that is light and whimsical.  It is formal but not what I would call over the the top.  Do dress nice though!\n\nStaff is obviously experienced and they know how to describe a meal properly.  They are also very friendly and make you feel at home.  \n\nThe variety of food was the ONLY thing keeping me from rating a 5.  Granted, everything sounded very nice and when it came out it was the absolute best quality of that dish that one could expect BUT nothing was out of the box. \n\nIf you are looking for dishes done the right way with a clean taste and not too much doctoring up, then come to Blue.   Great for a date, business meeting......just not the place you want to go if your pallet is feeling extremely adventurous!",3
"Husband and I moved to Wisconsin from Southern California, land of hand-made tortillas and bombity-bomb mexican, and have been looking for non-gringo mexican for the last month.  It's been a hard, painful, sour cream-filled road.  Up to Habanero's, the closest we'd found to the real thing was el Mariachi in Lake Mills (really good, and more capable of making the spice sweat-worthy, but unless you specify they will default to the bland side).\n\nFinally, a restaurant where the place was packed but we were the only gringos.  Fast service, killer portions (beat out our old standby in LA with the taco meat portions), and the flavor that we've been craving.  Get one each of barbacoa, steak and pastor, your taste buds will thank me.\n\nNot sure about the 3am rumor though, we wanted a second round after getting out of the Barrymore at 1am, and they were closed.  Still, if you're craving the food and wanting seconds the same day, that's a definite good sign.",4
"Looks pretty cool, nice selection of beer and drinks and food was really good. Good staff too. But what's with the music? Seriously walk in to the titanic theme song followed by brittany spears, lady gaga and kesha. Now don't get me wrong, i actually like all those artists, but not playing at a 'zombie' bar. A bit pricey too. The worst part was there was NOTHING to do. No dancing, no pool table, no darts, and of course no women... This place has a lot of potential but this last visit was a major let down. Only gave 2 stars because the bartender was cool",1
"My review is similar to others I've read for this restaurant.  We went on a Saturday evening to celebrate a Girlfriends Birthday.  There were 12 of us and we didn't have a reservation, so we were happily surprised when they were able to seat us right away.  There was only 1 other table and a few people at the bar.  The waitress took our drink orders fairly quickly, but it took over an hour for her to take our dinner orders and I believe that only happened because one of us asked her to do so.  The food took a considerable amount of time considering there were only a few other people in there.  We were all pretty satisfied with our food.  The appetizers were tasty and my Husband especially loved the egg rolls (which were presented beautifully as well) and we were all pretty happy with our entrees.  Props to the chef!  Sadly however, the service was just awful.  My glass was dry on several occasions and it was difficult getting anyone's attention for a refill and once we were finished eating it took nearly another hour to get our bill.  I just don't understand why there was such a lack of service.  From start to finish over 3 hours had passed which I find unacceptable.  There are some positive changes made to this restaurant decor with the new ownership, I just don't see it lasting if they don't make some radical changes in the staff.  My advice... Keep the cook and fire everyone else!!",1
"What a joke.....the only part of the club that was open on Thurs was the outdoor bar.   Too bad the temp was 105.  Not too nice when there is nowhere to sit either.   I'll be skipping this lame club next time we go to Vegas.\n\nThe bartender declined our card as well, found out later that nothing was wrong with it.  Scared us into thinking that the bank had frozen our account due to fraud.",0
"Jack in the box is very similar to Burger King quality for probably a much cheaper price.  The fries, very much like BK, were actually delicious, but the burger was probably the worst fast food burger I've ever had.  There were also a few homeless people hanging out inside this restaurant and trying to hit us up for change.",1
"Club had a great remodel.  But its going down hill really fast.  The mgmt is not friendly, and most of the personal training staff scare me to death.  I have seen one personal trainer who seems to know how to be a proper Trainer.  So if you go there ask for Frank(He's on top of his game), pretty much most everyone else you are putting your own safety at risk  The GM prides himself on telling people if they don't like something they just have the option to go somewhere else.  Not to bag on everyone there, some of the front desk staff greet you with a smile and try the best they can, but it's pretty easy to see it starts up top.  So I guess you get what you pay for-",0
"This place came highly recommended and the reviews seemed great. So I was glad when I saw a coupon for $40 worth of food for $20. (I should have known better)\nWow, I didn't know that you could ruin Pad-Thai that badly. I should have known the place not going to be good when I ordered Jasmine Tea and he brought me a cup of hot water and a tea chest. I should have gotten up and left. At least I would have had a decent meal instead of the travesty that they gave us.\nMy wife and I love Asian food. But to me this place doesn't even qualify as Thai. It's more like a fusion restaurant that tries to do much at once and does it all badly.\nThe place is too loud, too cramped and the waiters need to take comprehension lessons. We asked for the Sushi special a Tsunami roll, we got the Samurai roll instead.\nThe Pad Thai tasted like it was made by a kid that worked at Nothing but Noodles. I mean,\"" Come on, this is the supposed to be the signature dish of Thailand.\"" It's supposed to be full and flavorful tasting. It's not even supposed to look like pink, limp noodles that have been over cooked. ( The HORROR!)\nIf you like traditional Thai food run the other direction. If you have never tried Thai or like typical mall food Asian fare then this place is for you because you don't know any better.\nWhat a waste if an evening!\nddc",0
"Don't stay here if you care about housekeeping or customer service.\n\nOh, the room itself is great - king studio suite with a desk, sofa, full bathroom with jacuzzi tub, and kitchenette. The price is right at about $120 per night. The location's pretty awesome, adjacent to Planet Hollywood's Miracle Mile Shops, in the center of the Strip. \n\nBUT! And this is a big but!\n\nThere is ONE TRASH CAN in the whole damn room, in the same room as the toilet. It is barely big enough for a few paper towels, meaning it will overflow within the hour. Housekeeping will not bring you a second trash can - and believe me, I asked 4 times.\n\nThe maid will be friendly, but she WON'T BRING YOU ANY TOWELS. That's right, after 2 nights I was forced to call and ask for more towels once I realized none were coming. She won't replenish the toiletries, wipe down the bathroom counter, clean the mirrors, or really do much besides make the bed, either.\n\nWhen you call to request help, no one will call you back. Finally they'll call you back on your very last night and insist they haven't heard anything about housekeeping problems at all, that you're obviously crazy, and that there's nothing they can do for you. They will do their best to sound very annoyed as you explain that no one brought you towels or washed your dishes, and dismiss your complaints very quickly.\n\nSo sorry Planet Hollywood but I won't be back. \n\nP.S. Your valets were super friendly and helpful, you should let them run the whole hotel.",0
Their pizza is pure deliciousness. The bf said it was the best pizza he's ever had. \n\nTheir shrimp alfredo pasta...was alright. The alfredo sauce was just too fatty/greasy. The shrimp were ginormous. I would ask to go easy on the sauce next time. \n\nTried the oreo sundae. Shared it with 2 other people and still had trouble finishing it. It was awesome. \n\nHave yet to try the famous frozen hot chocolate...gotta do that next time.,3
The beer choices are unique and the food was pretty good. Definitely not worth the wait because the service was brutal. They were out of nitro so the stout was not available and they were out of lemons. They were also out of flight glasses. Overall it was very disappointing. It took forever to get our server to take our order and the food took almost an hour to get to our table. \n\nThe refuge IPA was pretty good as was the Oaked n ordinary and the Santa Teresa. The Arizona trail burger was excellent. I'm not sure I'd go back except I really want to try the stout.,1
"I just have to say that Jen, Cheree and Pharrah are my favorite ladies at this place! They are always happy and very efficient with their work. The other thing I like about them is that they always remember everything we talked about the previous session which always makes you feel really good!\n\nMy results have been great so far! This isn't my first experience with laser hair removal and this by far has shown more results then previous treatments at other spas. Im very happy overall with my experience so far!",4
"YUM! YUM! YUM!\n\nWe visited Wild Thaiger for my wife's birthday after she saw it featured on a TV program. Really yummy food that was presented well too. The wine list was a little obscure (we're sort of wine snobs!!) with no recognizable brands. However, my wife chose a Chilean Chardonnay and it was great.\n\nParking was a breeze with plenty of space behind the restaurant (that was free).\n\nWe'll be back!",4
"Cibo Urban Pizzeria Caf\u00e9 is a nice quaint place.  Went there for lunch and tried Margherita  pizza and Salsiccia with tomato sauce, sausage and mozzarella.  The crusts on both pizzas were good with a fair amount of char but could have been a little crispier. I would highly recommend this place if it there weren't better pizza places in Phoenix (Bianco?).  I would give the pizza 3.5 to 4 stars.  However, their pizza menu is quite extensive and I would like to revisit and try some other pizza styles.  \n\nWe did have the Nutella and Mascarpone cheese crepe and it was great. \n\nNote, most of the patrons there were having salads and sandwiches which looked really good!",2
"I went to this store in Galleria Sunset Mall with my 2yr old son. A clerk, who was a old lady, was very rude to my son, and made me very upset. He accidentally dropped a lollipop by the register, she yelled at him,  \""hey! hey! hey! hey!!!!\"" and asked me \""Did he break it?\"" I answered \""No, your lollipop is fine\""  Then, she checked lollipops very closely.  What is wrong with her?  She was also so rude to other customers. Even someone got some products, she had never said \""thank you\"" for the purchasing.  I believe she really needs BASIC training.  A person like her, who doesn't like children/not nice to kids, shouldn't work at this store.",0
"Don't stay here!!! This is the most horrible customer experience I had ever have in any hotel. My husband & I checked in on a Thur night. There was a short wait to check in at the front desk, which was ok. However, the front desk blonde girl (I think her name is Sarah) was so cold & made us felt very unwelcome!!! Our reservation was for a one king bed room, which we had no idea which building it was going to be. In fact, we had never been to the Palm & had no idea how it was liked. When we checked in, this blonde girl said our reservation was for a 2 full sized beds type room in the Fantasy building. The more we kept insisting we reserved a one king bed, the more she insisted we had a 2 full sized bed room. Not even a tiny bit of trying to work with our request. We didn't see any kind of smile on her face, but a cold stare. We finally showed her the print out of our reservation, then she said our reservation was in fact a 1 king bed at the Palm (old) building. Again, no apology whatsoever. At the point, we were already so done w/ this girl & just wanted to check in. When I asked how could I contact my friends, who were staying at the Palm Place building. This blond girl asked me my friend's name. After I gave her the name, this blonde said, \""sorry, but due to confidentiality, I can't give you her room number,\"" I had no idea why she asked what my friend's name was on the 1st place if you couldn't help. Plus, I knew my friends' room number. All I was asking her was how to contact them from one building to the other b/c they are from London & had no local cell phone service!!! Before we were done, this blonde girl didn't tell us any type of comp we could get at the hotel nor any kind of introduction to this hotel. I couldn't believe such horrible customer service would exist in this planet!!! The room was ok. A bit old. Bathroom sink was stinky from the poor plumbing. TV was the real old type that kept flicking. Bottomline, don't expect us to stay here ever again!!!",0
"2.5 stars.\n\nFor 6 chocolate bites, I paid about $15, which I feel I overpaid for chocolates that are just ok tasting. Many of the chocolates I picked out have this wierd, yet subtle sugary, grainy taste on the outside. If you were to try any of their chocolates, I would go for any of the truffles. Those actually taste a lot better than other chocolates, but I would probably head to Godiva next time.\n\nAnd yes, the lady behind the counter wasn't that nice to us either, but it's probably because she has to deal with drunkies all day long. That or having no customers at all. I would probably hate that job too. But after we were in there for about 10 minutes talking to her, she warmed up to us a tad.",1
"Wow, what a disappointment. I feel bad for those of you that rate this place highly, you really need to try some good Indian. \n\nI didn't think it was possible to have bland Indian food but boy did this place prove me wrong. I stopped in for the lunch buffet based on a foursquare tip that the place was voted Best Indian in the New Times. I'm not sure who was doing the voting or the tallying, but I have to think it was a big mistake... or it was fixed. \n\nI tried a couple of bites of almost everything on the lunch buffet, 4 or 5 different veggie options (I tried every veggie option they had) and 2 different chicken dishes (Tika Masala and Curry). All dishes except 1 (one of the veggie options, I don't remember which) was bland and needed salt. Mind you, I've NEVER once before used salt at an Indian restaurant. Here, everything needed it. \n\nThe only saving grace for this place was the garlic naan and the desserts - the minced carrots with sugar and cheese was tasty and different. \n\nThe service was less than mediocre - had to ask for my drink twice and the bill twice. \n\nSafe to say that I will NOT be returning.",1
On average we order dinner from sidewinders about 4 times a month. Every sandwich we've tried has been excellent and the cookies are ADDICTING! The delivery drivers are fast and once they even went back for the cookie they forgot! We've tried a few fried items off the menu and they arrived hot and tasty as well! Ordering online makes it super convenient! \n\nOur faves:\nReese's cookie\nThe meatball sub\nThe Italian (spicy or combo) \nThe club\nThe pastrami,4
"DO NOT STAY HERE. My purse was stolen at the pool and while we were waiting (almost 20 minutes) for security to come another guest came to report their bag was stolen as well. Security took our report but gave me wrong information about filing a police report. I later learned if you don't report it in person to the police (rather you do it over the phone) then the Las Vegas police do not investigate. This is why TI tells you that you can call the report in. I think either they don't want the police investigating or it's their staff doing the theft. Then we requested new rooms keys since one of ours was stolen, they were surprised at why we would request such a thing. There was no apology, no compensation. I had to have my passport sent FedEx to me since my license was stolen and TI wanted to charge me a $7.00 handling fee for receiving the package, I told them no way, I'm not paying that. Also, we had a medical situation in front of the Mirage and my friend called TI and asked them to have a cab sent to the front of the Volcano at the Mirage on Las Vegas Blvd. and they refused, they said \""no\"", that's the Mirages problem not ours. Terrible service, one evening we saw people filling out security reports in the casino because their wallet was stolen. The hotel itself also does not compare to some of the others, it's outdated, and the layout is terrible, the parking garage is really far from the room elevators and lobby. It's a little lower class as well compared to Caesars, the Wynn and Mirage etc..\nNever once did the management call to apologize or compensate us in any way. I would never stay here again or recommend it to anyone.",0
"As for the restaurant itself it's a pretty small place.  Not sure how the busy they get, but if they ever do you could be in for a wait.\n\nBack to the food for a moment.  We had the special which was ham on bone, and Zwiebel Schnitzel with onion. The special was good and Schnitzel was just okay.  \n\nThe atmosphere was nice and staff was friendly.",2
Don't eat at this place. The gyro came wrapped in a cold cardboard like pita bread. I will say the owners wife was very nice but the owner him self being on his lap top was very off putting. Felt like we were bothering him. I had some fries as well let's say all 10 fries were tasty I'm guessing they were having a potato shortage with just a hand full of fries. This place had a very dirty beverage fridge in the public area. Just not a well put together cafe with very poor food.,0
"Like the rating says, it was just OK.  The housemade pan fried dumplings had a great tasting filling but came off being a little too greasy for my taste.  Bulgogi was acceptable, nothing earth shattering.  I also tried a spicy seafood soup special that came with shrimp, clams, and mussels.  While the broth definitely had a great umami taste and spiciness, I was put off by the 5-6 unopened mussels that remained in the soup.  This not only questions the freshness of the ingredients but also the attentiveness of the kitchen as they should have been removed before serving.\n\nAnother annoyance is that as of last week, they just received their liquor license but still not serving beer (only cocktails).  Hard to wash down the food drinking a cosmopolitan or a gin rickey.",2
"So, I went for the screening of This Is 40 ( which is a whole other review in itself). The place is located in a lovely plaza but the buck stops there. The seats are leather and cracked...for $7 for a bag of popcorn, I expect better. The sound quality was very low, so it was hard to hear if people laughed or clapped and the visual quality was off as well; I expected it to be crisp and clear. Granted, the seats were comfy, like that old recliner you've had for years but, again, for the inflated prices they can do much better.",2
It pains me to down grade them a few stars but this last experience was disappointing.\n\nI do note we did stop in for happy hour this time and really enjoyed the $5.00 margaritas and $5.00 mini tacos but I don't judge places by their happy hours because Happy Hours are usually happy anyway.\n\nWe had a really great dinner here last year and thought we would again. It's a BEAUTIFUL ATMOSPHERE here and they have beautiful Christmas Tree and Ice skating at the Princess.\n\n For Dinner I was going to try the Grouper or the Pistachio Crusted Tuna this time but to my surprise they took them off the menu and replaced them with a Tempura Battered Fish. (website needs an update)  Why would I order Tempura at a Mexican Place? So I went with the Skirt Steak. \n\nOK I didn't like anything on my plate. The steak wasn't tasty. It looked OK but just didn't taste good. I guess it needed some salt and pepper. I should have asked for salt and pepper. It was just soggy beef and also was like chewing just cow and not a tasty steak. I didn't like the potato gratin because it also needed salt and potatoes don't taste good unless they are salted. I didn't like the enchilada because of the horrible thick mole sauce. This was the worst mole sauce I've ever tasted in my life and if it was my first time with mole sauce I'd never touch it again. The sauce wasn't balanced and was thick and too much chocolate and it turned my stomach. I do note the table salsa was seasoned nice and the bar foods we tried were made nice so I know you can get good food here.\n\nMy husband ordered the short rib that I had last time. The rib this time was OK but not great like the one I had last time. This time it didn't have the really tasty crust on it and the portion size was much smaller. The rib was just passable and not made with the really great care like last time. But my husband felt really bad when he tasted my plate and told me I could have his instead since it was better.\n\nA very nice manager did check on us and offered to get me something to fix my meal and it was before I knew what was wrong with what I was tasting. I told her it was just OK.\n\nLast time they weren't busy and the food was very good. This time they were very busy and that might or might not be  factor in this last experience. I received my meal for free since I have a preferred diners card.,1
"I have never had the urge to eat here but my friends didn't want to wait in line for food, so we ended up here because they had no wait. It is good as a bar environment, if you want a bustling atmosphere where you can cheer for your favorite sports team, watch some people attempt to ride the mechanical bull, get drunk and eat a bit of appetizers. Don't come here if you are looking forward to a super appetizing meal. It is essentially just bar food that is served. I ate the Chili Cheese Taters and the PBR Burger. The food is heavy and there is nothing special about it. Most of our stomachs felt unsettled after eating here. Additionally, our waitress was grumpy and didn't do much to ensure we were having a good experience. I would rather eat elsewhere but if I were into sports I would probably go back for drinks during a game.",1
Great happy hour place. They have a unique menu with kangaroo meat in there. The service is great and they take wonderful care of you. Everyone was super friendly. I got the fish tacos and it was good and cheap. I doubt I will come back though.,2
"You'll never find a more wretched hive of scum and villainy than Fry's Electronics.\n\nYes, they're often cheaper than Best Buy. Yes, they theoretically have a better selection than Best Buy. But--and this is a huge but--they suck even more than Best Buy.\n\nThe store's merchandised poorly, organized poorly, and the employees are awkward, useless, and ready to go postal at any moment. Lately Fry's has been eschewing a lot of quality stuff in their core product line to sell crap they mark up more. \n\nAnd then we come to the best feature of Fry's: The Little White Sticker. Shopping at Fry's is a game. You win if you can actually manage to find what you want WITHOUT the Little White Sticker on it. If that Little White Sticker is there, you're buying someone else's returned merchandise. Usually with missing parts, and usually at a discount you can count using pocket change. You will often find the product you want is only available in a previously-abused configuration.\n\nTrue story: They were selling a returned $150 power supply, missing all of its cables, for $149. Bargain of the century!\n\nBut hey, they're finally taking all 4 major credit cards!",1
"Meeting people here is easy cause this place clashes with anything a sensible person would see on the strip :D \n\nNot near the strip, but pretty well self contained. Has the old Las Vegas feel without having to go to Fremont Street, so you can just hop on a $12 cab ride to the strip if you need.\n\nNot a whole lot else here.",2
"quite possibly the worst sushi I have ever had. I ordered spicy tuna don.   The tuna was spoiled, and the sauce was straight mayonnaise with no spice or flavor. This allowed me to really appreciate just how bad the fish was.  \n\nAt least it was a good portion size.  If you give bad food, at least give a lot of it so your customers really get sick.\n\nAddition from later same day, I was nauseous beginning 1 hour afterwards, lasting for several hours.",0
"If your homesick or just looking for some Good hawaiian food, this place is your home.\n\nI travelled to Hawaii a few years back and this place brought back a few memories of a few local eateries I use to visit. The staff are friendly and have no problem answering any questions you might have.\n\nI order the boiled sweet potato and the katsu chicken. Both dishes came out in a fairly decent time frame and were presented in a local style cafe. I will say This business isn't about how it's presented, it's about the food and it was all cooked to perfection.\n\nRecommending here will be no problem for sure!! They are great with kids, so a family setting is assured!\n\nMy only knock was we did wait a little while for our server to come take our orders, but I think she was pretty slammed, so I can't fault her",2
"Only in Vegas does one have to walk through a poorly ventilated casino and into a little cigar bar to get a craft beer.\n\nWe had a special deal in our Yelp Spring Break book for a $2.50 beer here which lured us in.  I went for a mango wheat (because wheat beer is pretty awesome and mangos are super awesome) only to find out they had switched it out for blueberry vanilla or some such thing.  Obviously better that your typical Bud Light/Heineken typically found in Vegas, but it tasted a bit like an air freshener.\n\nIt really wouldn't be a bad place to hang if it weren't for the cigar bar aspect, but we could only really handle it for a few minutes before we took our beers to go and lost some money in the slot machines.",2
"Stained sheets, hair and food byproduct on nightstand When we got our replacement sheets there was no offer to change them as they were thrust into our hands. Burned out lightbulbs and towels that look like what I use to dry off the dog.",1
"They did a good job washing my car and hand drying it. I chose to go to this place because for some reason, i like it better when a machine washes my car rather than random people. If i wanted it hand washed, i'd do it myself. The 2 guys who greeted me under the big shade thing were very friendly and nice, but the woman who \""cleaned\"" my windshield to look for cracks was extremely rude, thats why i deducted a star. i have a tiny crack on my windshield and when she pointed that out and said they will repair it but i had to give my insurance card, i said no! then she proceeds to give me attitude which i thought was not necessary. will i go back? hmmm, yea if my car gets dirty again but for now, ill be looking at another place",3
"WOW, I feel explaining my experience here would not even come close to how I truly felt, words cannot express.\nThe service was TERRIBLE.  I can start with the witchy \""know-it-all\"" bartender being completely rude, not helpful, and pours one awful drink.  If you order a mixed drink, don't expect any alcohol in it.  The bartender informed me they serve 3 1/2 counts per drink, and if you're a bartender like I am-you know thats not even a shot of liquor.\nSecond, the bald manager who made inappropriate comments, and even shut the fire off on us when about 4 of us were sitting around it!  Then proceeded to cackle laughing as he was walking away to sit with two employees who probably had gotten off of work.  I also watched him down two cocktails, and smoke cigarettes while going inside and out of the patio.  That is some extreme inappropriate, dissatisfying management.\nI will never return to this place again, I now know why I avoided it for so long. There are WAY better sports bars within a 1/2 mile radius of there with better food, service, and ambiance.\nEven the diviest of dive bars are better than this crap.",0
"Drove by today and decided to check the place out.  We ordered three pieces of candy, buttercream, amaretto cream and chocolate mousse. The flavors were a bit bland, honestly, we couldn't tell the amaretto and buttercream apart. Also, they have a chalky-dusty taste to them. Probably won't be going back again, was underwhelmed.",1
"I am amped that this particular site does not include four dipping sauces for a 20 piece, Chicken McNuggets. The only give 3, and you have to pay for the fourth. Any other McDonald's in the area gives you four without asking. This McDonald's is trying to pull a fast one. So I just want everyone to know how dirty I think this is.\n Ever since I was a kid when we ordered nuggets we got 4 dipping sauces. That 5 nuggets per sauce. They expect me to try and ration almost 7 nuggets per container? That's unacceptable. I guess I will visit the McClintock or the ASU locations from now on.",1
"Sorry guys, it really shouldn't take 30 minutes to make 2 small vegan tacos. There were a couple people that ordered dine-in ahead of me, but when their food came out, it looked like everyone had ordered some form of salad, so that's even less reason for the preparation to be so slow!\n\nThat being said, the tortillas tasted and looked freshly made. The taco ingredients were tasty, with a vibrant pleasing look. I really liked the spices and seasoning in the walnut meat mixture, and the tomatoes and micro-cilantro were very fresh. The salsa had a touch of spice which livened up the meal, and the sesame cucumber side was refreshing.\n\nThe pay system is through an i-pad where you have the option of adding tip to your meal right when you order, which I always find weird. How can I adequately add tip to service which I haven't even received yet? (I usually don't carry enough cash to tip in cash after the end of my meal either- I usually leave it up to the credit card)",2
"I am actually very surprised at all the not so great reviews of this place, I know that initial reaction is, \"" Oh Raymond, you must not know good Mexican when it slaps you in the face.\"" My response is this, \"" the food can't be good if its slapping you in the face and I really do know me some Mexican food. This was one of those places that we pass all the time when walking to the movie theater or the players club and have not given it a second thought. One Sunday we were on our way home from our church that is on Dean Martin and my wife was craving Mexican food so I decided we should hit the one in the southpoint.\n\nWe walked into the southpoint and headed to our buddy Miguels, The lady at the door/counter seated us and off we went. One of the servers brought us the starters, I obviously expected chips and salsa but instead we received Chips, Salsa, Guacamole and bean dip, Whoa hold the train here, \"" Um, I did not order this\"" I know sir it comes with the meal.. Yes, Miguel scored. we then cracked open the menu and see the amazing combo, $8.95 for two items, Fideo, beans, rice and a Drink, yes this means alcoholic drink and we are not talking bills gambling hall .99 margaritas these are adult sized. \n\nThe food came out and everything on my plate was awesome, from the beans to the taquitos, it was all hot and fresh and tasted as authentic as you could expect at a casino Mexican joint. If it was in my kitchen that would be a different story. But for $8.95 you just cant beat it.  The service was great, the food was great and it definitely makes you want to return.",3
"MEDIOCRE at it's finest! Fine dining without the fine dining experience! Let's talk about first the service: I didn't even know my servers name? He didn't introduce himself and he didn't even show up for a least 10 minutes when we sat down. Didn't give us a drink menu right away, sat there looking stupid because we didn't even get any recommendations all he said was \""it's good\"" he was French I presumed with an accent. \n\n We started with the beef carpaccio with the Parmesan sticks? It was good, but the sauce served with it was very salty. Tuna carpaccio was OK with a strong anchovy dressing. \n  Entrees: the Spanish seasoned rib eye was\nYummy but did take an hour to arrive (he did mention to us that it would). The PULPO was my favorite (grilled octopus) just the way I remembered when in Barcelona. The side dishes sucked!! We sent back the babycorn with the popcorn season? Was too salty, the sweet red peppers also over seasoned, I guess the Delmonico potatoes were the best! \n  I will not return, if you want a good steakhouse try Jean George's at ARIA",1
"I've never been so disappointed in a veterinary visit.  I brought my new puppy to this location to make sure he was healthy before I introduced him to my other dog. He seemed to be having an ear issue and I let the veterinarian know. All I was told was that his ears were too hairy to be able to tell \""but if I signed up for the healthcare plan\"" they'd be able to do a test to see what was going on. They were more concerned about selling me a year plan than my dog. Not wanting to commit to a year plan with them they advised me to simply clean my dogs ears. Now BOTH my dogs can't stop scratching their ears and I now have to pay for two visit to a different veterinary office and find out what they have going on in their ears! I am so disappointed I waisted my money here and even more upset I now have two dogs that are suffering from their inability to fix the problem with my new puppy. I will never spend aanother penny in this store and would advise anyone going to their veterinary clinic to choose an different location or completely avoid banner clinics.",0
"I truly wanted to love this place. It's clean, family oriented, obviously adult friendly (beverages), and had the most amazing jukebox I have ever seen (although not working at that time.) Too bad the food was a let down, the knot were good but tasted like they were microwaved, the pizza was good if you like a sweet crust (I prefer sourdough), the pasta was okay but the sauce was a let down, and the worst was the tiramisu (a store bought tasteless mess). I would have loved to make this my regular place if it were just a bit better.",2
This place killed my dog!!! After changing his seizure medication per Dr. Farrington two weeks into the transition he started showing signs of abnormal behavior I called the vet office to get the Dr. advice. No call back!  Four days later he entered the longest seizure hes ever had I took him to the ER they pumped Valium into him and hours later the seizures finally stopped after three days in the ER doctors that worked there contacted Shea Animal Hospital to speak with Dr. Farrington still they couldnt get a hold of him.  I tried nursing my dog of 12 years back to health but it was clear he was gone and I had to make the tough decision to put him down.  Dr. Farrington Im calling you out your negligence has taken my best friend away and you should be ashamed of yourself!!!  Be warned,0
"Venerable Chef Hiromasa Kyodasan and crew's recent arrival heralds an upcoming rocket to higher food standards. After just 4 weeks, his discerning approach is already evident, but he has his work cut out for him.\n\n--controlling hostess is stickler for seating rules; _throw down_ to avoid a 30 min wait, or just ask for the manager\n--Kyodasan brought with him two chefs, one kitchen, one teppan. great things to come!\n--he's already fixed wasabi (no more tubes),\n--gari is fresh and tart (not from a jar one month opened) and\n--seaweed wraps are dry and crispy, rolls made fresh, not in advance\n--fish selection (corporate \""sashimi grade\"" blech), and tempura batter will change up first of the year.\n--great family place, main dining is loud and boisterous\n--benihana \""experience\"" feels forced and scripted\n--watch out for upsell-freak waiters at your teppan table\n--one lunch server is power smoker, taking 3 minute breaks _during service_, then thinking we wouldn't smell his breath.

What are the odds that on the day I discover his arrival at Benihana, she shows up again?! They'll think I'm some sort of spy. Of course, she arrived right amidst the lunch rush!\n\nI hope my update will mark a dramatic improvement over the next weeks and months.\n\nGO HIRO!",1
"90% of my visits here consist of only prchasing gas here at their gas station, the membership has paid for itself many times over in their fuel savings. When I visit their store for purchases, their selection is awesome and their pharmacy is prompt with Rx. The only reason why it's not 5 star worthy is because no matter how busy it gets, they only have two registers open at any one time. When you're in a rush the slightly inept cashiers are mind-numbingly slow and grumpy.",2
"A friend took me here for our weekly lunch and it was a really cool dining experience.  It's very no fuss, it's set up like a fast food place, you look at the menu on the wall then order from the person behind the window.  Then they give you a buzzer that will go off when your food is ready while you go pick a place outside to eat.  The food is amazing!  You can tell how fresh everything is and it's cooked great too.  I can't wait to go back and get another great burger!",4
"Came here for a pre-concert meal by a suggestion of a friend. Couldn't thank him enough!\n\nWe arrived around 630 and had no wait at all to be seated as a party of 4. Loved the funky feel of the decor it stood amongst the rest of the trendy burger place popped up all over Vegas lately. \n\nFor starters we got the chicken buffalo dip (must try!), the lobster mac n cheese (I'm not much a seafood person and I still enjoyed it), and the fried pickles (who doesn't like fried pickles). The GM (Sergio) came over and greeted us and was very helpful giving his suggestions as to what to order. For entrees the other 3 in the group all ordered the \""rising sun\"" and per Sergio's suggestion my hubby added a fried egg. I went against the stream and ordered the \""korean bullgogi\"". All of us were speachless when the food arrived and all agreed it would be awhile before we could ever eat a burger from anywhere else cause we didnt want to tarnish the taste of these burgers!\n\nBefore heading out my girlfriend and I ordered some of the adult shakes to go. She got the grasshopper and I ordered the guava float. Both again were well worth the cost of $11 (really a steal considering you'll pay about $15 for a red bull/ vodka at a casino floor bar). \n\nYes the prices may be a bit much for burgers but really wasn't isn't pricey about Vegas anymore! And for the freshness and quality you get at Holsteins its well worth every penny. This will be one of my must return to spots for future Vegas trips, even if just a stop at the bar to grab another shake.",4
"When I heard that this place was owned by Pizzeria Bianco, I was kind of excited, but two lunches later, I've filed this away as just a bad idea. The food - at least the two sandwiches I tried - were okay, but just not anything special. Perhaps my expectations were high, both because of the pedigree and the excellent place that occupied that location just before, and that made for greater disappointment. But nothing can change the fact that the lunch menu  is extremely restricted - 3 salads, 3 sandwiches and a couple of pastas, from what I recall. The sandwiches were served on crusty bread. Now I'm a huge fan of crusty bread (I mean I even nodded in agreement during the scene in Ratatouille where the chef says a good bread talks to you), but that's what I want for my bruschettam antipasti plate or with an olive oil and grated cheese dip - for sandwiches I expect something easier to bite into without the risk of taking out the eye of my dining companions, a focaccia or ciabatta perhaps. \nOne can guarantee that you will not be walking away over-full. A guarantee that you'll be satisfied or wish to return is as close to impossible as getting a side of balsamic vinegar with your sandwich there. The good news perhaps is that there still is an excellent lunch alternative in Cyprus Pita Grill next to it, and should you, like I and my friends, still have an empty feeling after lunch, there's Yogurtology just  down the line.",1
"Happy Hour is AMAZING there - the calimari and roast beef sliders the best of the bunch.  I also enjoyed the fish, branzino, I think it was.  The siracha chicken sticks were not fully cooked, which was a bummer, because the sauce was good.  I could pass on the mashed potatoes, and side salad.  Also, it's valet parking only - so bring extra for the valet drivers.\n\nI probably wouldn't go here for dinner, but would be there in a second for Happy Hour.  :)",3
"I haven't had Chipotle in a while, and suddenly found myself inside here waiting in a very long line to place my order.  It's been a while since I've eaten here, so I figured it was time!\n\nWhen I entered, it was the dinner rush, so there was a very long line.  Ahead of me were 4 Phoenix fireman, along with a UPS driver.  Nice! \n\nDespite the line being painfully long, I placed my order.  I got the Fajita burrito with the shredded beef.  Tasty!  \n\nI do have to give a kudos to the staff here.  Clearly, they were extremely busy, and despite that, I was treated with courtesy and a smilng face!  That goes a long way for me, as I know how frustrating it can be when you are looking at a line out the door.  \n\nI also really like how thier menu's set up.  Fairly simple, with nice choices to choose from.  Not to complicated, easy to understand and a fair price point.\n\nReally enjoyed my time here, and the staff was wonderful. Will return in the future!",3
"I like Chinese buffets as well as the next guy. You know the drill... All you can eat of modestly-priced somewhat greasy Chinese food. But honestly I lost my appetite after one plate, so they certainly made a good profit on my dinner tonight.\n\nTo be fair, a big part of my bad experience was that they seated me next to a table of 10 teenage hooligans who (it seemed to me) were having a contest to see if they could do something outrageous enough to get themselves thrown out of the restaurant.  Unluckily for the rest of the diners, the hooligans won... Nobody from the wait staff or management lifted a finger to even suggest that their shouting, singing, throwing food, loud belching or shrill whistling was the least bit unacceptable. They also left the buffet itself in a very unappetizing state each time any of them visited to fill their plates.\n\nTo give them one star because of rowdy diners wouldn't be entirely fair; However, the food didn't deliver either. Most of the dishes were quite unappetizing. Greasy, shiny & overcooked seemed to be the norm. The crispy duck -- rather unique in a buffet setting -- was acceptable, though some of the garnishes showed signs of serious aging. The inclusion of more traditional Scottish fare on the buffet -- chips, mashed potatoes, Brussels sprouts -- didn't score any authenticity points. Honestly the high point of my meal was the dish of soft-serve ice cream at its end, which (though they offered no toppings to speak of) was light and smooth.\n\nI walked by the other branch of Jimmy Chung's (down by Waverly) and that one looked much nicer.  But I won't be giving this branch another try.",0
"Sadly, El Mas Sabroso is permanently closed. There is a new Mexican joint there now. They are good and the pricing is about the same. They did clean it up a bit and redecorate/remodel. Kinda like Filiberto's, but nicer and more modern inside. I think they were going for the Chipotle's look. \n\nLike Filiberto's, the burritos come with pure meat. Wanna add rice or beans? It'll cost ya! Wait... they have to remove meat to fit the rice/beans. Rice and beans are cheaper than meat! Why on earth would anyone charge more money when they are saving money??!?  Senseless.",2
"I'm not a big breakfast food fan, but this is the one place we always go to when visiting family out in Phoenix.  Ambiance is good and service is decent.  They have a nice outdoor seating area, which is enjoyable.  \n\nThey have a bunch of egg/omlette options.  They have $1 pancakes on their specials menu- definately order one or order a few.  They melt in your mouth!",2
"Nothing spcial, nothing terrible.\n\nThe rooms were clean, and I really liked how I could walk out of the self-parking garage directly to the lobby w/ elevators so I could go up to my room. That was something special to me. They have Keurigs in the rooms, but the coffee tastes expired. The bottled water is part of your resort fee - speaking of which, I had a comp night here and the guy who checked me in handed me back my card and told me he wasn't even going to charge the resort fee. Kudos, shout outs, and thumbs up.\n\nI didn't explore any of the hotel at all, instead, just spending the night here. It's definitely an older hotel and it's rather dated, especially in the rooms and corridors.\n\nOverall, I'd stay here again... if it was complimentary only.",2
Love you guys.... But the diet Mtn dew fountain is not as good as store 476. Correct that ands it's a 5 star review.,0
no that great of a breakfast,1
Over rated...crotchety owner...needs an attitude adjustment.  Friendliness is not an attribute.  The pizza was burned in a few places and the taste was okay - nothing to write home about (and yes...my home is New York).  The wit is not worth it - neither is the food or the tude.,1
"Darren had been dying to come here for some reason. It's near the Wal-Mart we go to, so I said why not? lol. The decor inside is neat and centered around airplanes since it's near an airport. The service was off, though, and the food wasn't that great. The Parmesan Crusted Artichoke Hearts were really good, but things went downhill from there. The Chicken Cordon Bleu was bland and rubbery. Dessert was a flavorless chocolate cake. Some people walked out while we were dining since the hostess wasn't around to seat them. Heh.",1
"I'm a big coffee drinker (at least a cup a day), but that being said I'm not much of a coffee \""snob.\"" Sure there's some places I like better than others, but I'm perfectly fine w/espresso over ice from Starbucks or *gasp* coffee from Dunkin Donuts. \n\nThat's probably why I'm not blown away by Echo Coffee. Sure, I like local coffee shops like this. Even though I only stopped in for an iced coffee to go, the place seemed to be a nice spot to hang out at. I liked the high ceiling, the \""open\"" atmosphere, and the plenty of seating that they offer, but quite honestly, the coffee was just okay. Maybe I'm just used to the \""cheap stuff\"" (I DO drink Dutch Bros. at least 2-3x/wk), but the coffee here just tasted a bit acidic. \n\nI don't have an issue with this place charging a bit more compared to chains, but at the end of the day, I'd rather pay a little less for coffee I like better. \n\nThe baristas here are friendly, though. I came in wearing a Berkeley hat, and I chatted it up w/an employee from the Bay Area for a few minutes who was very nice.",2
"For some reason this seems to be the only pub that is always PACKED on any given day on Mill Ave..\nThat's about the only reason why we always end up there if we are partying on Mill Ave. \nI gave it three stars because this place is so darn tiny and oddly shaped (think of a wide hallway) and yet somehow it works..\nThe crowd seems to be mainly ASU kids partying too much with their fake IDs.\nThe crowd is like, 40 percent douchy, which is actually not too bad considering it's Mill Ave. \nI can't complain about this place, I don't love it, I don't hate it, It's okay but I would never go out of my way to go there. Not really my scene but when you're stumbing around Mill and it is the only alive looking place on the block, I'm bound to walk in. :)",2
"Yum yum yum.  This place was bustling on a Friday night, and with good reason.  The veggies were fresh and the sauces weren't too heavy.  The tofu wasn't fried and there were plenty of vegetarian-friendly options.  The prices seemed a bit higher than your average Thai restaurant (and if you like Thai it appears you will like Laotian...) but it was still an enjoyable visit.  Our server was friendly and non-intrusive.  Overall, I'd be happy to go back here!",3
Hands down the best cheesesteak you can get in the valley. Family owned and delicious!,4
"I'm always on the lookout for a morning coffee place  and decided to stop at the Coffee Bean. Since I am always interested in trying new places, it looked inviting and clean, and was close to where I was going.They had the usual items you find in a coffee shop, and there was ample seating, with outside tables. That said, it wasn't anything out of the ordinary. However, if I am in the area, and need coffee to drink while reading my newspaper, this is a good option.",2
"I was so excited to hear that Dos Caminos was coming to Summerlin. I had tried the one in the Palazzo a few years ago and loved the guacamole. \n\nWalking in .. we noticed that they hadn't done too much renovating from the old Agave restaurant. It's still open, spacious with comfy booths all around and a huge inviting bar in the middle. Love the outdoor space which would be great for cocktails and appetizers. \n\nWe ordered the Guacamole with the Jumbo Lump Crab and Chipotle .. it was just as good if not better than I had remembered. The trio of salsas was good as well, and the accompanying chips crisp and nice and salty. \n\nMom decided on the Grilled Shrimp Quesadilla which was served on an open-faced crispy tortilla. She loved it .. I mean really loved it .. and she doesn't usually go for Mexican fare. She even loved it as leftovers the next day! \n\nI wanted to try a little of everything and got the Dos Caminos Bocadito Trio. It came with two pieces each of the chicken taquitos, molotes potosinas (corn masa turnovers with roasted pepper rajas, spicy house made cheese,\npepita-pasilla de oaxaca salsa), and the plantain empanadas. I found the empanadas to be bland and mushy, the chicken in the taquitos dry and the potosinas just okay. Definitely not something I'd ever order again. \n\nWe will most certainly be back as it's so close to home and I would go just for the guacamole, salsa and chips. And then maybe sample one of those yummy sounding desserts!",3
"I like this costa, don't know hy but other costas i just avoid because the location and how busy they can get.\n\nThe staff were friendly,smiley and polite when they took my order and didn't batter an eye lid when i ask to sit in with a paper cup as i was just waiting on someone.\n\nCoffee was a flat white and was tasty.  Good, coffee and good service makes me happy and the world a better place.  ok it's not an indie but I do like my indies too!",3
"Great burger and fries--hot and flavorful, good toppings. Not exactly Michelin star quality but a great burger joint, which it aims to be. Friendly and efficient service.",3
"this place is packed during dinner and breakfast, call for a reservation in advance if you can. \n\nif you can catch a seat on the patio, go for it-- the restaurant is right across form the fountains, so it's cool to catch a show while you eat. \n\nThe food is reasonably priced and cooked to perfection. I had the filet mignon for dinner, it was juicy and tender. Steaks come w/ a side of fries, which were so so, there are other side options but they cost extra. \n\nService was superb. Our waiter was attentive and very friendly. He made us feel as if we were regulars.. it's rare to get that kind of service anywhere! \n\nHighly recommended!",4
Food was very good but WOW this place is LOUD when it is busy.  Concrete walls reflect all of the sound and gave me a headache.  Never had this happen at a restaurant before.,2
"Do not even talk to these people. They are not honorable.  I called NPS, National Pool Supply, on centennial for a recommendation of a good pool person.  They said I haave someone right here and handed\n the phone to to him. His name was Ron from United Pool Service. I told him my problem and he said he could come to my house and see what was up.He came by and said that  I needed all new seals for my pump and that he'll be by next morning about 9:00AM $65.00 plus $45 .00 for parts.The next morning came and 9:00 came and went. 10:00 came and went still no Ron and no call so I called him. He answered with the excuse that he got pulled over for a loose box that flew out of his truck. Red flags start waving.  \nFinally he got to my house and got to work.  He finished and I paid him. Later I went out to look at his work and discovered that my pump was leaking. It didn't leak before.  So I called Ron and told him what was going on.  He said sorry and that he would be back tomorrow to fix it. I haven't seen him since.  I have a ton of texts with a ton of excuses from \"" I got strep throat, to \"" im Tony and I'll be over after I finish with his current job\"". I told the both of them that I leave for work at 2:30 so they need to be at my house before then. Tony texts me at 6:00 saying that he was at my house and could'nt get in. NO SHI-!!!!!\nIf he went in my backyard without permission he could have gotten shot. WHAT A MORON.\nI thought that National Pool Supply knew their clients and knew the good from the bad. NOT S0 MUCH. I checked United Pool Service and found that they have a F rating with the BBB and a lot of very bad feedbacks, and heres another one. \nI pray you read this before you do any business with United Pool Service and don't ask National Pool Supply for any recommendations.",0
"This place is a gem in Uptown Lebo. Great strong European-esque lattes. The owners are from South Africa and plan a unique dinner on the last Friday night of each month with a different international theme. You register in advance and it's BYOB the night of. My husband and I attended a Caribbean themed night this summer in July. It was fantastic! Go with a group of people and you'll all be seated together. A wonderful experience. Small plates, tapas style. \n\nOtherwise, this is a lovely cafe to step into for a scone with a cup of tea or coffee.",3
Been here before it was good back then and its good now.....they accept Credit/debit cards now with a $.50 fee which is a ok wif me.....nom nom nom....lol,3
"Cool Mexico atmosphere.  Greeted by the owner at lunch time who was a super cool guy!   Had the shrimp taco and the fish taco.  Shrimp taco was ok, the fish taco rocked!  Great fresh fish and the cabbage gave it that perfect taste combination.  Wife had the Chix. quesadilla.  She loved it.  A little over priced, but the food was very good!",3
"The most important quality a mechanic can have is honesty. Meet Tim Walter. When I take my car to Walter's I know the service will be good, fast and won't take a chunk out of my last paycheck. Calling ahead is usually a good idea so they can fit you in...",4
"Absolutely terrible service.  Restaurant completely empty and still bad service.  Now the food, not only is the service bad but you guessed it so is the food.  So bad we left after appetizers.  I got six oysters and it took them I don't know how long to bring them.  Six, my 7 yr old could shuck six in six minutes.  We ordered clams in butter, didn't know clams could be that small.  Wife got a wedge, how do you mess up a wedge??!!  Remember restaurant still not even half full.  Should have read yelp before going.  \n\nSeriously heed my warning and others about this place.  You actually have to put in effort to be this bad.",0
"After a disappointing Italian lunch earlier, it was time to get serious. Once you have a craving, it has to be taken care of the right way. Time to turn to an old friend. Metro Pizza never ever disappoints. I've enjoyed Metro for 15 years. Used to be a regular fanatic at the Ellis Island location. Awesome garlic knots!!\n\nSo anyway I hit up the Flamingo/Decatur location for takeout. On this trip I ordered the Modesto pizza. It was delicious. Simple but so good, and cooked perfectly. Awesome crust, mushrooms, crushed tomatoes, spicy sausage. And of course my wife had to have the chicken fingers. Her absolute favorite. She turned me on to these a while ago, and I have to agree with her, these are the best chicken fingers out there. You can order them mild, medium, or spicy. We opt for medium. Just enough tang and spice. The fingers are HUGE!!. lightly breaded, hot, juicy, flavorful. One bite and your hooked. Dip it in there delicious ranch dressing and you're in for a treat. \n\nMetro is a local favorite and never disappoints. Really good pizza, chicken fingers, Italian favorites, great service, reasonable prices. You can't go wrong!!",4
"I was super excited about coming here b/c I loved my old Plato's Closet in Plano where I found TONS of awesome deals on usually pretty high priced clothes. \n\nThis place is really only a good deal if you are REALLY into Abercrombie and Hollister, other than that, the store is fairly limited in the brands it sells :(\n\nMaybe if it were slightly bigger it could carry more...",1
"If I could put 0 stars I would.  terrible service, overpriced, shitty food, and small portions.  With far better dim sum places right around the corner you would think they would be motivated to compete.  The branding and logo makes it look interesting, but that is where it ends.  The waiters are barely interested to help.  We watched several tables have to get their own cutlery and yell to get the waiters attention,,, and it wasn't busy at all.\n\nI am almost convinced it is a front, because no one seems to care about the food or the service.",0

"After reading reviews for this feast buffet, I was prepared for it to be mediocre. That is exactly what it was. For ten dollars....I would go back. \n\nSome highlights:\nSalad bar was fresh and had great wet salads\n\nTerriaki chicken thighs in Asian stationed were juicy and flavorful\n\nMy man recommended the fried chicken from the American station and I like the Collard greens and creamed corn.\n\nItalian station can be avoided nothing special but did like the meatballs\nHighly disliked the dessert station all my choices were super old and to dry or too soggy. Stick with ice cream!\nOur service was good. We are gonna try breakfast next.",1
"Beso Off  is the best way to put it. A restaurant that needs to be shuttered - and in a city where there are many other choices, most likely will not continue to survive as the place does not seem to really care about the issues with the restaurant.\n\nAnd cheap food  - as in quality, not price. Or, the head chef is just way too enamored with salt, which is usually used to hide the cheap flavoring of sub-par steaks, especially the way that they slather it on everything.\n\nSo, this is a cluster beyond clusters. We came here for a business dinner because the Los Angeles location has good reviews. Big mistake.\n\nThe wait, etc was not bad. We made a reservations, they sat us when we had more than 50 percent of our party there. The wait staff - Craig and Angie - were super nice, very charming and had more common sense than the assistant manager on duty, Chad Jahn. Yep, totally using the full name.\n\nSo, let's start with the cluster:\n\nA) Fire in the kitchen (grease fire) that made the whole place smoky. The grill is right there, so you can \""see\"" them cooking steaks. Big whoop, sorta cool, but OBVIOUSLY too small for a restaurant of the size. And, apparently, the back kitchen is just as bad.\n\nB) Our salads/soups come out fine - nothing spectacular, but not terrible - and then we wait for the steaks. And wait. And wait. Oh, by the way, it's only 8.30 when we sit down but they're already out of the bone-in filet which the waiter talked up. How do you run out of a steak by 8.30 PM? Kitchen incompetence??\n\nC) We're still waiting for our steaks. It's a good 45 minutes post-finishing our salads and appetizers. We're still waiting. And still waiting.\n\nD) Angie and Craig are proactive, and good wait staff; they come up to us and apologize about the wait. It's not their fault - the kitchen is run by incompetents, but they do their job and do it well. \n\nE) The steaks come out ... medium rare. Not the medium that was ordered but the medium rare. We send them back, and one comes back ... charred on the outside, but still rare/medium rare. He's too nice to send it back, and the issue is that the kitchen is backed up so just sending out steaks. Good way to settle a problem with an incompetent kitchen staff: send out undercooked meat and hope they don't send it back to cause more setback in the kitchen. Idiots.\n\nF) I ask for the manager - the man with no freakin' sense to come to our table. This would be Chad Jahn, who looks like a former bouncer that has been elevated to restaurant manger. Demote him back to bouncer, that's what he seems he'd be good at. We talk to him, tell him the issues ... and he never checks up on us again. Good management skills, asshat!! Oh, and he doesn't acknowledge our issues when we leave. He did take care of the bill, but I think he had to be told to do that (I told him we're getting free desserts). \n\nG) I got churros. I like churros. The churros at Costco are better than Beso. Um, useless kitchen staff, churros are served hot. \n\nH) So, while walking outside with the colleague for her to smoke, we pass by former colleagues and they ask how it went. We told them it sucked, to leave. There was this long-haired guy listening to us. I'd noticed him for a bit walking around, so I said \""are you one of the owners\"" and he said, no, he's just waiting for a friend. Um, found out he is one of the owners. If, as an owner, you cannot take responsibility for your poor service and food, the restaurant as a whole are doomed. Nice sidestepping and not taking ownership, long-haired 80's rocker looking dude!! His (or Chad's) solution to the fire and the wait was to offer free Sangria. Thanks, and those that don't drink thank you also. Idiots.\n\nI) Like I noted, the food was salty. The steaks had a salt layer that should not be necessary if they are really Harris Ranch. The string beans, mushrooms and other vegetables were slathered with salt as well. Salt is a lazy additive for poor quality and tasting food. Draw your own conclusions here. \n\nWe got out of there 3 1/2 hours later, when it should have been 1 1/2 hour dinner. It's not because we were socializing, but because it was just waiting and waiting and waiting and then sending back food and waiting. The place is a train wreck rapped up in hipster clothing (well, like most things hipster) and the management (and owner) seem unable to manage or take ownership of the problems and issues. Good riddance for when it shuts down (the chef should not be a head chef), but our wait staff rocked and should be at a better place.\n\nEva Longoria Parker should be ashamed her name is associated with this place. But, it might not be that long before others force it out. I heard Mastro's is opening in Vegas...\n\nUpdate: Yay!  A fake review posted by an employee or PR person for the restaurant!! Thanks Megan!",0
"Ambience - awesome.  It was a bit entertaining that occasionally a few tables would get quiet and it felt like I needed to whisper, then the conversations would pick up again.  The ebb and flow of volume was intriguing!\n\nService - fantastic.  Our favorite was when we asked for a wine reco.  I'm not sure who the expert was who came over, but made some suggestions, and we went with a New Zealand red that he seemed to like more than the more pricey wines.  It was I think under 30 pounds--quite cheap for this restaurant.  Anyway we loved it.\n\nThe Scallop hors d'oeuvre was incredible.  We wished we'd gotten 3 each for our dinner...but alas, we had one.  For dinner we had the Wellington, because it was recommended highly by two of my friends.  I was only disappointed because it was 80 pounds.  It was good, and fed both my girlfriend and I...but I'm not sure it was \""80 pounds good\"".  It did come with two sides: we chose Mashed Potatoes and Green Beans, which were both very good.\n\nWine = outstanding\nService = outstanding\nAmbience = outstanding\nAppetizer = outstanding\nDinner = good\nSides = grea",4
"In Short: Awful food with no imagination, go at your own peril.\n\nI was in downtown Phoenix and it was pretty late so decided to drop by this place.  Looked OK from the outside but I should have walked out as soon as I walked in.  The place was adorned by eclectic collection of 60's, 70's and 80's lefotovers.  The atmosphere from the start was dead wrong.  Hardly any of the staff spoke english, which made ordering an interesting adventure in it self.  \n\nThe menu is also a collection of 60's, 70's and 80's leftovers ans typical chinese dishes.  Which in my opinion is Ok if the food was any good, unfortunately that was not the case.  We ordered a soup, a appetizer, and two main dishes (kung pao chicken, and spicy beef).  Soup was decent but the appetizer was over cooked and soaked with oil, then plastered with a thick sauce to make up for it.  Spicy beef was overcooked and unappetizing as well, I suspected the meat was a little old as well.  The real kicker was the cungpao chicken, my friend noticed a piece of rotten vegetable on our dish.  We brought this to the attention of our waitress who took the dish to show to another staff member and then came back and said there was nothing wrong with it and it was a water chestnut.  She took over 10 minues to explain this but for the life of me I couldn't understand her.  They really didn't give us an option to replace the dish, get a new one or even refund the money.  I have no idea if it was a rotten or actually a chestnut but they could have at least offered us a compromise.  Customer service was pretty much zero.  I eat a lot of chinese food and I was really disappointed with the oldest chinese restaurant in phoenix.",0
"Meh. I must've gotten the wrong thing because I was not overly impressed. The teriyaki sauce on the ribeye was way too thick and sugary, and I scraped as much off as possible. The macaroni salad had good flavor but it didn't pair well with what I ate. Not really worth the walk up Fremont St. for me, but YMMV.",2
"I was a 1-800-Flowers man, but it was Saturday morning before Valentine's day and I just couldn't risk them screwing something up like they sometimes do.  So, I used my Googling skills to quickly find a local place that could hopefully get my wife flowers on time the next day.  Luckily I came across Campus Flowers.  Their online ordering process was painless, their selection good and prices reasonable.  They were able to pull it off and deliver the flowers right on time!",4
"I am really impressed by this facility. Every machine you could want, Racquetball courts, The best spin bikes anywhere, large arobics room, free weights, TV's on the cardio some with ipod hookups, pool, spa and a steam room.\n\nSure the staff may be incompetent, and the sales people are probably very shady, but luckily I was grandfathered in from PureFiness and rarely deal with either. \n\nOne of the biggest negatives for me is the parking lot. There are more speed bumps in the parking lot  per 100 feet than you will see in your whole day. I do not know why they felt it necessary to put so many of them. I can not drive my convertible here due to them.\n\nI also am unsure about the aroma of the free weight area in back, To me it smells like a barn, but I think it is due to the glue used on the floor. Either way I do hope it dissipates soon.\n\nThe machines are nice they usually have two to three of each type of machine with the latest being the eclipse line that are very smooth and easily adjustable.\n\nThe spin bikes are great, very smooth, digital read outs and so far 100% functional.\n\nA small grip with the TV's on the cardio equipment is the channel selection. News stations sports, E and some anti acne channel. I would be happier with the local mix of channels.\n\nThe pool area is nice with a three lane lap pool, sizable spa, and steam room. They are cleaned nightly but there are some grimy spots that could use a bit more attention.",3
"Went here for my friend's 21st birthday. We googled free admission clubs and she picked this place because it sounded like an interesting spot. It was free admission for girls and $20 for guys plus there was free vodka drinks for girls until midnight so we figured, hey, why not! (When we got there, we all got in free because we were on the guest list.)\n\nAfter we checked in and got our wristbands/hand stamps, we walked down a wide, white hallway to the dancefloor. It was a site for sore eyes. I swear everyone and their mother--literally, old moms trying to relive their glory days--were crowding the dancefloor. There were far too many 30+ yr olds  and not enough 20-something's for my liking. I can't forget about the old pervy looking 40 yr old dudes trying to prey on the young. Definitely not my scene!\n\nAlso, the dancefloor was too small, the music was a mix of old and new hip hop and some reggaeton which was all good except the DJ would play a fast beat then immediately follow it up with a slow tempo song which completely slowed down my groove too quickly. Oh and my heels kept getting stuck on the floor because it was extremely sticky from all the drinks the hoochies and grannies kept spilling. Ew. Because of the mess, there were employees who constantly had to walk into the crowd and wipe the floors WHILE people were dancing. So tasteless, completely ruins the club atmosphere. \n\nAnother thing, there was no designated smoking area so everyone was just lighting up all over the dang place. I can tolerate some smoke but when it's in such a confined space with sweaty bodies bump'n n grind'n and poor ventilation, it begins to affect my breathing. Not cool PURE.\n\nMoving on to the bathroom situation. There are no easily visible signs or directions that lead you to the restrooms. I had to ask 2 people where the hell to go and it was like a journey trying to find it! You had to cut across the side of the dancefloor just to find some dark corner that finally leads to the bathroom. Good thing about it was the large counter and mirrors and the SPACE omg the space! was a relief from all the cramped dance floor. it was clean, the lovely lady even walked me and all the girls to the next empty stalls. That was great service! Too bad I couldn't say the same for the bar...\n\nThe free vodka drinks were weak, maybe that's why they were free. Also, the female bartender was curt and didn't even say hello. I bought 2 AMF's for $30. Steep prices but it's expected for a Vegas club, or any club for that matter. \n\nOverall, if you wanna dance and rub elbows with your granny and her 60-trying-to-look-21-year-old friends, go right ahead. The all too-bright lights will definitely highlight their \""good\"" features. This is a definite SKIP IT!",0
"I went to this restaurant on the advice of a neighbor & I was pleasantly surprised. It was really good food. Haven't been back since, but that is only because of the price. A little high for my budget, but was a nice experience. \nThe place seems like a dump when you walk in, but the food is actually quite good. I'd go back if I had an extra $40-$50 for 2 people to eat dinner.",2
"Just stayed in a spa room at New York New York for 3 days. The giant jacuzzi tub in the room was awesome. The price of the room was incredible as well. The only downside? The wifi was terrible. TERRIBLE. To have it included in the daily \""resort fee\"" was just insulting.",3
"Sadly this one is closed. I found so much at this one. Went to the Meadows Mall last weekend and noticed that it's some generic body care store. This one was bigger than the Blvd. Mall/Miracle Mile Shops locations, and had really good selection. \n\nGet the member card, subscribe to the e-mail list, and shop the sales. I really love the Body Butter products ( mango, coconut, shea butter, vitamin E, cocoa butter, raspberry, just to name a few), the gifts (no-brainer gift idea), and the foot kits (great as gifts, but I use it too). \n\nAm the only one that thinks this is funny that one can still write reviews for something's that's closed?",4
"Been here twice so I'm guessing that means I like it..  But it is the only decent pho joint on the east side that I've come across..  Til I eat somewhere better, it'll stay at 4 stars..",3
"The V Bar is perfect for a bar that serves as a Prequel to the begining of a great night. Vegas is all about going BIG right, but you have to crawl befor you walk. You come in and the music is good, order drinks and your feeling good. The V Bar also serves Hooka's  so you can toke up different flava's such as cherry, apple or even mango. Overall its refreshing to be able to chill and have drinks with friends before you lose your mind, money or self respect in crazy ass Vegas.",3
"So no one is going to confuse this place for fine dining, but I gotta say- it gets the job done. Old School pizza that is really good when it's piping hot out of the oven. It's not the best a day later, so keep in mind to get it while it's hot, and then maybe tip your 40, because it's over Johnny.",2
Went with a group of 10 and I had the tilapia Bianca and I was not impressed at all. Although my Absolut lemon drop drink was good and the dessert was awesome I had the warm butter toffee cake.  Service was ok not great.,2
"I was really really excited to try this restaurant. Not only because of Gordon Ramsey and his standards, but because the food looked amazing. \nGot there and the line was quite long, which is fine. Went to the Asian hostess and ask for a table for 2 and she old me the wait would be 20/30 minutes. Sure, no problem. While waiting I got a call from a friend saying that he wanted to join us but wasn't sure yet. Asian Hostess comes to check again \""so table for 2 right? I'm just making sure\"". I said, YES but a 3rd person might join us for drinks. She said \""oh no. That changes everything. Your wait now is going to be 1 hr. And I said ok, I will make sure he's coming and I will let you know ASAP. She looked at me and said \""AND DONT EVEN TRY TO SNEAK A 3rd PERSON TO A TABLE FOR 2, OR ELSE YOU'RE GETTING KICKED OUT!\"" I was like \""excuse me? Get kicked out of a restaurant? Are you serious?\"" She said \""that's how my manager is\"". That KILLED my experience. I was really really upset. After that, I dont even remember how my burger tasted like. The straw is shorter than the cup... You have to fish it with your fingers to drink out of it. Definitely NOT the attitude I expected from a GORDON RAMSEY restaurant and his standards.",1
"I dined here on the advice of an avid yelper. His suggestion was that I try a place off of the Strip, and away from downtown LV. \n\nWe used GPS navigation to get there, thanks to my Droid and Google maps... \n\nWe had dishes of spaghetti, fish, and steak. All were large portioned, and the staff was very friendly. The nights specials were sold out already, and there were a couple of menu items that had been dropped,\n\nLots of flat screens to watch sports on.",3

"The best breakfast in the Valley...PERIOD! If someone can think of a better breakfast place AND THEY HAVE EATEN HERE, send me a PM. I usually write long accounts nit picking places but it would be disingenuous to do that with Crackers. I've eaten at many of hte best places in NY and SF and aside from this place's lack of pretense, the food is right up there with those places. Of course, you will never hear that from someone from those cities but food for food, this place is as good if not better than those places. Furthermore, if you are going to knock it down a star because it's located in an industrial strip mall then you my friend are a fool...no ifs ands or butts, you are a fool.\n\nThe biscuits and gravy are better than most places I've eaten at in the Deep South including Oklahoma, Tennessee and Mississippi. The eggs are well eggs...I still laugh when food critics like to critique a place based on their eggs.\n\nThe real draw to Crackers is that unik 99% of most diners and famous breakfast places, Crackers actually makes all their own food from scratch including the deserts.  Everything is home made and you can taste it. \n\nOne last thing, if people said they ate here and it wasn't busy, they are lying. This place is always busy. I used to work near it and even when I tried to time the place I couldn't because it has limited hours and its patrons are loyal. Trust me, I'm a Dr. and I'm not Julius Erving.",4
"The worst experience ever. Don't ever stay there!! They gave us a room that smelled like throw up, after complaining the moved us to a so called suite. This room was from the 70's. Had a broken shade and broken phone and dry boogers on the comforter. Manager came and all they could say was sorry and I had to wait over two hours for one to show up. Now there is a bug into room . Never will I stay here!!! Ever",0
"D's is a great place to drink to your heart's content with any darn beer you please! They have just about any beer your little mug could possibly conjure up. The service is quick, not overly friendly but they get the job done- what you expect from a pub type atmosphere.  A great after-work unwind.",3
"This is my favorite grocery store. They have their own brands that make very delicious foods. They also have amazing free samples every day. I really like their princess cupcakes. They have pretty frosting! I like their carrot cake stuff, too.\nI also have what seems to be a second family there. This one employee told me once that I look just like his granddaughter and that he kept mistaking me for her, so I call him my grandpa now. :) I haven't seen him for a while, but I don't have as much time to go over anymore.\nLastly, they have good markdowns sometimes, but it gets really competitive between customers. Everyone wants good deals.",4
"Doesn't even deserve a long review as i usually give. \n\nExtremely overpriced for the quality of food you're getting. Over salted. Undercooked. No. Just no. We ordered the jambalaya and two burgers. All were terribly mediocre. \n\nThe service is a joke as well. It took 15 minutes to get water, another 15 to take our order, and 45 minutes to receive our food. Absolutely disgraceful. \n\nThis place has a great name but has a terrible attitude. I guess the name arrogant really fits! Will NOT be returning and will be spreading the word about how bad it is here for the price.",0
"Move in was the 1st of November. Employee was extremely rude and un-helpful he just kept complaining that he didn't know they had a move in, he was too busy, and that he doesn't generally work at this location. He refused to view the unit with us. When we got into the unit it looks like the previous tenants had just moved out. Stains on the carpet, didn't even look like they vaccumed. Paint on the balcony, dents in the fridge missing screens and a pillow stuffed in an air vent?\nIf I knew this would be how we would get the unit I would of never signed the lease.",0
"I could stay in this store all day! The home goods section has so many unique finds and the staff has always ben friendly to me.  My only disappointment is the shoe section, its very small.  If you are looking to redo a room in your home or apartment, check out this store!",3
"I finally went to this place after driving by it for 8 years.  I would always see it and say to myself \""I need to go there one time,\"" but never actually following through.  After reading some quality reviews on here we decided to bring some family there for a graduation dinner.  \n\nWe ordered some Mussels to start and those were very good.  They were tender and the sauce was good.  We also had the Caprese Salad to share amongst the 4 of us.  I was pretty full after the appetizers so the girlfriend and I split the Veal Piccata.  It too was quite tasty.\n\nThe entrance is very cool with the very large and old Ficus tree that had holiday lights woven through it.  Aside from some very loud, obnoxious and drunk guidos/meatheads that were there, it was a very enjoyable meal.  Bonus points for giving me a healthy serving of Sapphire on the rocks.  I will definitely be going back.",2
"Good variety of items, but at least for my visit, lacking in customer service. \n\nI will confess up front that I know NOTHING about gardening,,,, or most home repairs. \nBut in the LOWES commercials the people who work there happily & eagerly provide customers basic guidance and answer questions. If it says so on television, it must be true, right? LOL! Well, not so much. I found my visit as enjoyable as a visit to an auto repair shop. Feeling like I was bothering the busy people who work there with my questions which they didn't even pretend to understand & getting their curt answers. Annoyed, I turned to my other life lines for such situations; google & my dad. \n\nDisappointing.",2
"We got in here without a 50 minute wait that was the option at True Food, which is our go-to place in the Q.\nThe service was excellent and the waitress got me a nice cushioned chair from inside that made me comfortable.\nThe starter was very good, Bruschetta Quattro, or something like that. But I had the Mediterranean Pasta which was just blah! My wife had Salmon salad which was OK but nothing special. I was tasting my dish and just thought that nothing stood out at all. I do not use dressing or flavoring so it was just not tasty food.\nI guess we will stick to True Food, it has a long wait for a reason.",2
"I don't quite understand why this place has 4 stars or so. I've only been here once and that was enough for me. The service is not the greatest, we had to wait  for a while before we got our food. The sushi rolls were ridiculously small and not fresh enough. On top of all that they charged a lot. I dont know if they were holding back on some fish or what but 4 or 5 rolls equal $50? kinda sounds silly if you ask me, especially if the sushi is half the size. The rice was kinda of hard and the fish wasn't the best. Im a huge supporter for the mom and pop businesses but this restaurant did not meet my needs.",0
"Can I give a zero star??!!  I think this is the worse internet connect here we have in Las Vegas (specifically in INDIAN SPRINGS or CREECH AFB, NV).  I've called so many times to complain about the issue, internet is veryyyyyy slow and intermittent.  The modem is showing 3/5 bars, which is good but the internet is worse than dial-up!!!  I've called other locations that also utilizes clearwire and waaalaaa they're having the same issue!  Talked to customer service but I don't know what it is, when a company outsource the most important part of their business (technical support) to save money, they're also giving up their quality of service.  These techs doesn't know 90% of the questions I'm asking, which I know is not their fault, but it's not the same quality you're getting if the techs know what the situation is and can relate it rather than reading steps of what to say next.  PLEASE CLEARWIRE!  IF YOU HAPPEN TO READ THIS DO SOMETHING!  Send your techs here and find out how bad the connection here and fix it.",0
I recently discovered this market and it's  absolutely  amazing!! The fruit and vegetables are incredibly fresh as well as their meat section.  The banchan section has a wide variety and it hasn't been sitting on the shelf for days as what you see in asiana market in Mesa.  The lunch counter in the back is delicious!!!!! I love the kalbi stew and spicy octopus.  I will be back weekly!,4
"I've tried just about all of the froyo places from North Phoenix to Tempe and several stops in between. I find most places to be the same as far as the yogurt itself but it's the vibe of the place that determines whether I frequent or not.\n \nTwirl is refreshing. It's simple, modern, sleek... HIP. I enjoyed eating my [salted caramel and nutella] froyo in peace - without the hustle and bustle often experienced at places like Yogurtland or Mojo. It makes a nice little pit stop on your way downtown or after dinner at Hula's across the way.",3
"Good food, fast and friendly staff. I like their loyalty card system, have made use of that for some free food over the last year. Recommend the 3 soft tacos if you want to try the different flavours on offer.",3
"Went here for my BFF's birthday and was so excited, we both printed out menu copies and highlighted what we wanted to order. Yeah, we're like that. LOL\n\nComplimentary bread was delicious. They had focaccia, pretzel, pumpernickel, and sourdough. The pretzel was my favorite.\n\nBone marrow flan - So decadent, yet light at the same time. Wish we got more toasted brioche for it, though. (It's OK because the waiter came back and gave more bread and it worked just fine.)\nAsparagus, poached egg, and bacon vinaigrette - Simple and yummy. I would get it again.\n\nBFF and I split a bone-in ribeye. It was OK. We've had better.\nFriend had the petite filet mignon. She finished it, so I'm assuming it was good?\n\nFor sides, we got:\nWild mushrooms with shishito peppers - Too sweet and not enough savory.\nCreamed spinach - It was OK. I've had better.\nFingerling potatoes - This was really yummy! My favorite of the sides.\n\nThe food was good overall, but we ordered too much/got full off the bread and apps, so we only had a few bites of the steak and sides. We asked to pack up the leftovers but they only came back with the steak. When we asked where our sides were, they said they threw them out. WTH? Why? We honestly had like a few bites of each. They threw away like $50 worth of food. :( The waiter offered us coffee after and we thought it was his way of apologizing for throwing away our food... until we saw the bill. He charged us for that, too.\n\nThe food was good. But I think I'll get my steak somewhere else.",2
"It's s grand old hotel that updated their small rooms.  But it's not up to their more modern competition except in architectural style.  One thing that could set it apart would be service,  but you really don't sense or get a level of service above the rest of like hotels. Even the food,  commented on by others, was not over and above other nearby restaurants.  I booked here for an anniversary because I wanted the best.  This isn't the best in Pittsburg,  or if it is,  then it means there is plenty of growth room for the competition.",2
Elan is the best! She truly cares about customers and what's best for the customer. Whenever I'm in vegas I always come see her. 5 star service. I've come to her for the past year whenever I'm in town.,4
"I'm absolutely clueless as to why this place is rated 4 stars; nothing about this place is 4 stars.\n\nI spent $300 after a corporate discount for 2 nights in a \""luxury\"" room with my girlfriend and there was absolutely nothing luxurious about it. The room smelled nice and the furniture looked french, but that's about as good as it got.  There was no closet in the room at all.  The worst part was the bed, which was a nasty old spring mattress older than I am (pushing 30); seriously, their rooms have hands down the oldest, most uncomfortable hotel bed I've ever seen.  I would expect to find a bed like that in a mom and pop motel in the middle of nowhere, not a \""luxury\"" room in a 4 star resort. I had to pay an extra $45/night to upgrade to a room with an upgraded bed but if I wanted to sleep on a king size bed with my girlfriend I had to get a smoking room (and of course I'm not a smoker).\n\nThe staff was not helpful at all; nobody offered to help us move our luggage or apologize for the laughably bad bed they tried to give me.  The music they play in the elevator is all from the 50's because they can't afford to license music anyone wants to hear.  All the French accents in their 80's informational videos and hold messages are horribly fake, their super-slow Internet access is $15/day, most areas of the hotel need a fresh coat of paint but they're so broke that their mini-fridge isn't even stocked with anything and the only 24 hour food place is a candy store called the Sugar Factory.\n\nAlso, If I'm paying hundreds of dollars a day at a resort in Vegas, I'd expect to be able to drink at the pool.  If you're thinking that too, expect to be told by the crew at the Paris that there's no alcohol allowed.\n\nAll in all, I was disgusted by my experience there and I'll never EVER stay there, gamble in their casino or recommend them to anyone.  For less money, you can stay at the Luxor in a suite with a hot tub.  Paris was the worst time I've ever had in Vegas.",0
"This place was ok for Champagne-Urbana. Stayed here for my cousins wedding. Rooms were spacious and the kitchenette was a plus as a serious lack of decent places to eat was evident. I don't plan on staying here again, but, then again, I don't plan on heading down to UC any time soon.",2
"I would go see this again and again, very funny and over all a really good show! This show while it is intended for adults Is not without a taste of class.",4
"This is my go-to haircut place.  The prices are at that sweet spot where it's not crazy expensive but it's not so cheap you sit next to riff-raff while you wait.  I always do the MVP.  The shampoo and hot towel are relaxing as you sit in the message chair.  I also like the personal shoulder massage they give at the end.  It relaxes you and puts you in a chill mood when you leave.  As for the haircuts, they are usually better than supercuts or any analogs.  They listen to what you tell them and write it down so next time they will know what you want which is very convenient.  The girls there are friendly and will remember you.  They are pretty good at making sure they are giving you the haircut you want.  Everyone usually request Liz because she is the best!  If you're trying it out try to get her if there is no wait.",3
"The is a great location. It is casual. It isn't overly expensive. However, a) it is noisy (tough for a table of six to have a conversation. A table of four would be fine, b) The Kobe Beef Burger - might be worth it..however, I asked for welldone and it was delivered medium. I didn't know until I took a bit. At issue was, they would redo it, but it would take 25 min, in 25 min I would be the only person still eating. Please, listen when your customer places and order. \n\nOverall, my impression was, Hey, we are the Burger Bar, if you don't like us, then you don't have to come to our establishment, go somewhere else. \n\nNot what I expected. Again, not a bad place - just be very clear to your server and recognize that they want you in and out -- The service I've had at Red Robin has been far superior.",1
"I had high hopes for Woodlands' lunch buffet based on the reviews. Unfortunately, the food did not meet my expectations and it was pricier for a hole-in-the-wall joint. \n\nThere weren't very many options: \""salad bar\"" (a large platter of limp salad with some sauces and onions surrounding it), a soup, bread, some fritter-type thing (not samosas), rice, noodles, a dessert, and about 4-5 kinds of curry. I know that sounds like a decent number of options, but all the curries tasted alike except for the saag paneer. I love saag paneer, but this was thin and bland. In fact, all the curries were watery... My plate had a pool of water that separated from the curries. I've never encountered that before. \n\nThe dining area was cramped and small. Which is fine... I don't expect ambience from a small ethnic place. But there was also no temp control -- it was sweltering hot... Which doesn't pair well with spicy-ish food.  The staff was nice, but incredibly slow. \n\nI would not return of my own volition.",1
"1.5 stars, actually.  \n\nCafe:\nIt was quite a late dinner and the cafe portion was pretty empty.  We got a pretty quick and good service.\n\nFood: \nAthens fries didn't really work for me.  It was good, but seasoning was bit too much for my taste.  \nBeef kabob was overcooked.\nFesenjan was tasty but on the sweeter side.  \nOverall, food was ok.  \n\nHookah lounge:\nThe worst of the hookah lounges I've been to.  The waiter, despite repeated requests to replace the coal never did.  He looked at the container that housed coal, blew into it and left.",1
"Fellow Yelper Kurdy S and I were curious about this Pin@y bakery, so we met here for lunch during one weekend. Looking from right to left, the interior was divided into a bakery section followed by a sizable dining area. The vertical glass case carried an assortment of colorful Pin@y sweets, rolls, and desserts. Everything looked extremely tempting. The atmosphere was casual, down to earth, and unassuming.\n\nThe Chicken Adobo ($7.99) came with bone-in chicken, vinegar, soy sauce, and garlic. The chicken was tender and meaty, but the marinade could be deepened by the soy sauce and more striking with the mix of sharp flavors. For some reason, the expected flavors were flat and notes to plateau and climax were severely missing.\n\nThe Sisig ($7.99) encompassed diced pork and pork ears saut\u00e9ed with garlic, onions, lemon juice, and fresh chopped jalapenos. Given all the sharp tasting ingredients, the flavors should have been far more robust, striking, and complicated. To the chef's credit, the positives were the food did not appear greasy; and the textures came out firm and not overcooked. The side of pancit was lacking flavor, and unfortunately, equally unimpressive. I've had all of these items homemade, so the experience was modest at best given this being one of the only two Pin@y bakeries in the area.\n\nUbe Hopia ($4.99) was my least favorite item from the bakery. The exterior was noticeably staled without the fresh flaky textures. Although the purple ube filling was delicious, the air pocket inside was too big for me to recommend it. To this day, my favorite Pin@y bakery is still Valerio's.\n\nDespite the limitations, the Sago't Gulaman ($2.50) was truly outstanding. It came in a big glass of tapioca, gelatin, and crushed ice. The drink was impressively refreshing to counteract against the hot summer weather. Of all the things I've tried so far, this is one item that I'd highly recommend.\n\nService was friendly and kind, but the food did take some time to arrive at our table. I still believe their food is a good gateway for those experiencing Pin@y cuisine for the first time. However, their targeted audiences could be much more inclusive of those who have already been introduced to the cuisine. I'd be interested in trying the other Filipin@ restaurant in the area before deciding whether to return.",1
"The first part in realizing that you have a problem is to admit it, well I have a coffee addiction. This place makes it very easy to feed my cravings by having a huge selection of regular and decaf coffees. I also think that the prices are reasonable and the staff is a lot of fun. I thank them for searching high and low when I request some coffees that may not be their biggest seller but I want to try. Stop in coffee lovers you will not be disappointed.",4
"MEEEEHHHHH. I mean, the tamales were awesome! The interior is beautiful, and we loved their spiced rubbed pork tenderloins. The other dishes weren't as flavor packed as you'd think. I went with the mango + spice tuna steak.\n\nThe tuna was outstanding. Perfectly seared and it had a very fresh taste to it. The seasoning was so-so, but the cous cous was delicious!\n\nThe dessert was a bit of a let-down. The churros were splashed with solid cinnamon but way too much herb. Felt like I was eating a root. \n\nArriving here without a reservation will disappoint you, BUT if you just put your name down on the list; you may get a call sooner than you'd expect. We luckily had a reservation, however a walk-in group were seated right after us despite the host turning others away.",2
I've heard sooooo many good things about this place and I love me some ice cream so I just had to check it out. \n\nI came here with my sister last weekend for dessert after a lovely dinner. I heard they have Vietnamese coffee ice cream now so OBVIOUSLY I just had to try it. lol. What a good choice! I had half of that mixed with one of my other favorites which is butter pecan. Loved it! \n\nEveryone was extremely friendly and it's such a cute little ice cream shop and everything is actually very reasonably priced. I'm so bummed that there isn't one on my side of town otherwise I'd probably go all the time. I'll definitely be coming back if I'm ever in the area. Need my Vietnamese coffee ice cream! =P,3
"Inexcusable poor customer service. It was a \""Please Seat Yourself\"" situation, so we did. There were only two other tables and two booths occupied at the time, yet we were never approached despite there being three different employees in the dining room and we were waiting for over 20 minutes. No comment such as, 'Welcome, we will be right with you\""...no menus provided, no water brought to the table or drink order taken...just a whole lot of nothing going on. We walked out and will never return. I gave one star simply because there is no option to give zero stars.",0
"You'd think they'd all be the same, or similar.\n\nI ordered for delivery online on their site. The guy gets here 45 mins later (no biggie there, if you're busy, you're busy... but you did say it was only going to be 30, this is NOT the reason for the bad rating though), and calls me from the street. I can't hardly understand him so I tell him where the entrance to my apt complex is and give him the gate code. \n\nHe insists I come out to the street and get it and says a bunch of stuff I can't understand. \n\nSo I get dressed and walk all the way out there (it's a pretty big complex). \n\nI ask him why he didn't just bring it to my apt and he's saying something about he's NOT ALLOWED to come in here, like our complex has been blacklisted or something... lmao.\n\nLook, it's a bad neighborhood, I'm not going to lie. But you're really going to charge me extra to have it \""delivered\"", then still make me get dressed and walk all that way to get it? If you're \""not allowed\"" to come in here, then how come it was never a problem in the past? I've had it delivered to my door here several times this year. \n\nAND TO TOP IT OFF,  IT WAS COLD. \n\nLast time I ever order from them again.",0
"Run! It is ALL about the money!! They find any reason to sneak a regular visit fee into a well visit appointment. I was charged for an \""extended education\"" for discussing everyday life. I will never go back and I wouldn't recommend this place to anyone.",0
"Meh. Two stars for arriving on time, initial friendliness, and speedy job. Minus 3 stars for the lack of bothering to screw the vents back in thoroughly, the hard upsell, and the short temperament after I declined more services. Yes, there is more dust beyond the reach of your vacuum (which is why I hired someone to clean them in the first place). Yes, I know the dryer vent is dirty... And the groupon says for an extra fee, you will unclog it, but apparently not because the vent exits the house on the roof. Sigh... Like so many dryer vents! \n\nLol. Had I paid more, I wouldn't be LOLing, but he told me my house was probably 30 years old (not even since it was built in 1995) and had never ever had the AC filter changed. It was not even as dirty as the filter in my apartment gets in a month. He vacuumed out my vents at least from a strong van mounted system. Idk what more I expected for the price of the Groupon... But I'll pass on that next time.",1
"Giving this place 2 out of 5 stars simply because the yogurt is actually pretty tasty.\n\nUnfortunately, the service is absolutely terrible. They hire teenage kids who act like they're at school and that it's a chore to be there. As others have said, the service is severely lacking and I know for me, no matter how good the food may be at a place, terrible service can make it a bad experience and not worth going.  They also have a very small selection, usually only about 5-6 flavors from when I go.\n\nI would recommend going to just about any other yogurt shop instead of this one. Yogurtini, Yogurtology, Menchi's, etc. are all much better.",1
"I wouldn't return.\n\nExpensive, not very expansive (just because you have a lot of space, doesn't mean you are serving a lot of food), and the food was standard Hometown buffet quality.\n\nFor The money they charge, I expect to be eating good food.  Nothing stood out as great...maybe the breakfast sausages.  Sausage is absolutely impossible to screw up.\n\nThe potatoes tasted like recycled egg cartons.  Well I guess it's good that they are recycling..right?\n\nGo to any of the other 356 good buffets in the land of strippers, Liberace, and Buffets.",0
"I finally got a chance to try Cheba Hut after hearing rave reviews about it from several friends. I think my expectations were too high. It was good, but it wasn't GREAT. The toasted subs are comparable to those that you would get at Quiznos but with some more interesting and innovative options. It was almost $20 for two 8\"" subs, one fountain drink, and one dessert. The food is basically fast food, and those are not fast food prices. I might go back again, but probably not soon.",1
So I have tried Main Ingredient a handful of times after several gave it great reviews.  I am giving them a so so rating because the service is usual less than good and the food is not the best.  The atmosphere and drinks are fantastic.  It is a great place to go hang out and have a beer with friends but I would skip it for dinner.  I have tried a variety of things on the menu and have found them either extremely average or below average in taste.  I am really surprised by all the great reviews of the food because there are many many better food options in the neighborhood.  Only one out of the 4-5 times I have been there has the service been decent.  The other times it has taken forever to even be acknowledged and even longer to get a drink.,2
"Ah...another Charlotte staple when choosing a ultra gourmet and romantic evening.  This was my first visit to the Fig Tree and I was very excited to see what it was all about to say the least.  I had already decided on my entree before even walking in the door so I was all set.  Thankfully, my girlfriend with her grand ways made reservations during the same time they were decorated for Christmas so the atmosphere was just perfect for us.  I ended up getting the grouper that came laden in a butter sauce with lobster meat that adorned the top.  It was great!  The cheese plate we had prior was good as well but may be a bit overpriced at $17.  My girlfriend ended up getting the pork chop entr\u00e9e and wasn't pleased at all with the preparation of the chops as they were a bit too fatty....shame.  I later tried the chops and I would have to agree they weren't exactly fat free but I soldiered through it anyway...ha!  The service was impeccable and delightful and the whole experience (all be it a little downtrodden due to the chops) was good enough to have me back again",3
"I know it is restaurant week and a Wednesday on top of that, but we decided to head out and give this place a try since there were two good reviews.  SKIP this place and head uptown or Piedmont Row.  I am not sure who our server was but he had zero interest in making the evening pleasant.  He went through the motions and in one case tossed our steak knives on the plates and walked away.  The food was better than average and the Super Tuscan wine was very good.  We decided to order desserts after dinner and they came straight from the fridge to our table.  I was hoping to find a gem in this place.",1
"this review is more of an update of one of my longtime goto neighborhood bars. i've come out of my dormant state to make a few points of why i won't be spending as much time here any longer. 1) i dearly loved drinking local craft beer out of a 32 ounce mug. sadly, i recently learned these great mugs have been replaced with 26 ounce mugs. my problem is i'm paying the same price for A LOT less beer...and i wasn't told. 2) after years and years of enjoying delicious meals here, i had never once complained about a meal prior to recently. it was a legitimate complaint and when i brought it to my bartender's attention, i got pushback and that made me feel like a bad guy. 3) just doesn't have the same \""local bar\"" feel anymore. the food is still great and they still have a great local craft beer selection.",1
"I really enjoyed myself here at MWC.  I came with 3 girlfriends as a 'girls night out.'  We were immediately greeted and taken to a table.  The ambiance, vibe of the wine bar was exactly what I picture in my head when I think wine bar.  I was dark, but not too dark.  Amber lighting and candlelit tables.  This is a great spot for a date as well.  My girlfriends and I shared 3 appetizers. We ordered the spicy crab dip, French fries and the rosemary salted sweet potato fries that were on as a special.  Both fries were perfectly salted and flavored.  They even came in these cute little wire baskets that look like mini deep fry baskets.  The service was on point as well.  Our server was very knowledgeable of the wine and great with the descriptions.  They have a large selection of wine that is reasonably priced.  I will definitely return and recommend!",3
"Bad service....my friend and I waited way too long. We sat there for an hour. Even customers who came in after us got their orders way before us....our order is not that complicated to cook..I def don't see why it took so long. Finally our food came, but it's not what we expected. Average taste. The soup is basically from instant noodle package. Thumb down! Besides, when I asked for some paper napkins, the waitress gave me a poker face immediately...we also had to pour water ourselves. Bad service..I also seriously think the owner is racist. She always smiles at white people but is very impatient with other customers. I would say it is my worst dinning experience.",0
Every time I've ever eaten here I've gotten grizzly pieces of steak in a Steak Burrito. When you are paying double the price of Filibertos to come here it is pretty frustrating to bite into that. The price is competitive with other major chains. The environment inside is very nice and minimalistic. The chips are delicious but are caked in salt. The salsa is good. Look up the secret menu.,2
"This place is terrible. We went there for din sum, but it turned out ther was no more din sum then. We stayed anyway and ordered five dishes for 4 persons. One of the dish, steamed fish, was recommended by the waiter. We asked about the price and the waiter told us it would be $38, about 2 lbs. So, we said ok. The fish dish took a long time and we were joking that they must have gone fishing. When it finally came, we were mostly full. Then came the bill, and there was a $104 dish! We were really surprised and asked what it was. It was the fish! It was supposed to be $38/lb, and the fish weighed 2.7 lb! The fact was none of us heard that it was $38 per pound. The bill was presented to us by someone we had not seen, and the waiter was nowhere to be seen. When we questioned the bill, another person came up and said something like \""of course it was $38 per pound...\"" No apology even for confusion or anything like that sort. We paid the bill, feeling cheated. Now coming to think of it, the fish could not have weighted 2.7 lbs. I often steam fish myself and a 2 lb fish is already pretty big, and our fish that day was at most 2lbs.\nI would give it no star if possible.",0
"We finally ended up here after deciding not to wait in line for the buffet at the Wynn. My friend and I both ordered the pastrami burger since it was recommended by the lady behind the counter. It took forever to get our food and was pretty pricey for a burger. I didn't know it was gonna have double meat- beef and slices of pastrami on top! Wow, I was so full after finishing the whole thing.",3
"Usually when I'm super hungry everything tastes good. But this place is disgusting. I'm not even picky about food that much - especially Chinese food. Their noodle sauce was sooooooo bland. We ordered class and when we got our dish, half of the clam shells in  DID NOT have any clams inside. The beef sauce tastes so salty and weird - it tasted more Korean than Chinese. Their service is terrible. Terrible terrible terrible. Waited like 7 minutes to be seated when there were plenty of seats available. Never checked up on us. The worst Chinese restaurant I've ever been to. DONT GO HERE",1
"Grab decent sandwiches and gyros, and enjoy live music if it's scheduled.  I was addicted as a student and still enjoy stopping in when I visit C-U, but it's a simple joint.  Right on campus near the quad.",2

I have always enjoyed the food here in the past but this weekend they really dropped the ball.  Our parties food was brought out at different times. By the time the last person got their meal the first person was served. I also ordered the salmon special and they forgot half of the order. By the time brought the order everything was cold.,0
We have worked with Dominica on several occasions and love her. Excellent work and delicious confections. \n\nDefinitely recommend them!,4
"\""$20 a month. No Gimmicks, no contracts.\"" Great. Where do I sign up? \""Oh yeah, there is a $49 sign up fee.\"" Ok.

"Best thrift store ever. It's huge and very, very well organized.  I stopped going to Goodwill because the stench was nauseating.  This place isn't entirely without that musty smell, but it's not so overwhelming that I want to vomit. \n\nI was completely blown away by the prices. I bought a ton of Halloween decor, two dresses for my little one and a large table cloth. My bill was $19.60! Amazing. \n\nI will absolutely be going back. If they weren't closing soon I'd probably go back right now, but I'll wait until next weekend.",4
"If you need a place to stay in Vegas, this fits the bill.   It's an older building that has it's glory years behind it.   If you are just looking for a place to sleep a few hours here and there, this is nice.   If you are looking for a room in which you can relax and just rest up, this is not the place for you.   The prices are fair, but the place is getting old.   Expect to take the stairs and the old elevator system just can't keep up with the current demands.",1
"I've had better experiences here, but today wasn't one of them. The girl at the counter looked depressed from making the wrong career choice and ordering from her was honestly kind of confusing. Our pizza was slightly burnt on the bottom and one of my pieces pretty much fell apart. It wasn't too bad, but there's just better pizza out there.",1
"Four of us had dinner here 2 weeks ago--much anticipation given the Chef behind the restaurant!\n\nHost staff was very pleasant--we were seated immediately at our table which had a decent view of the water-show at neighboring Bellagio.  The adult beverages were VERY good, and wait staff was excellent and well-informed about the menu.  One of our party was newly enamored of a drink she had previously had at the Chandelier bar at this same hotel--they did not have this drink at Scarpetta--but our waiter discussed it with the bartender and they came up with an excellent version of the cocktail--which may have surpassed the original!\n\nI agree with the prior comments about the bread basket--the bread with the salami was the best thing we ate all night.\n\nWe ordered many things off of the menu--from the basic spaghetti to the seafood pasta--all of it was served very quickly and at proper temperature, etc, and presentation was great.   The pasta portion of the seafood pasta was overdone, but the rest of the meals were very good (though nothing I would say we had to go back for, except that bread!).\n\nDesert was basic and boring--nothing exciting.\n\nOverall the ambience was great--excellent place for date night, drinks, and decent food.",3
"Who doesn't like this place? There is no way that this place deserves anything less than 5 stars. Awesome bakery items and the soups and sandwiches are perfecto. I LOVE that this place is open 24 hours a day, not sure exactly why that is, but I don't care or question it. I recently came here with 14 other gals and quickly found out that groups need to be approved by management. We ended up sitting outside the restraurant in the breezeway which was fine with us, but good to know for the future. Awesome place to take friends who are visiting from out of town which is what I'll be doing this coming weekend.",4
"Today was my first visit to this establishment. I thought it was a breakfast-only type place, so when I saw they were open during the late afternoon I was pleased. Got a great parking spot and we were seated right away. It was also randomly happy hour, and the burgers were $2 off. Got a delicious burger with super tasty waffle fries. Love the pretzel bun!! I was stuffed by the end. Didn't have any issues at all. Staff were all very friendly. Would love to try breakfast here! Can't wait to come back and bring the boyfriend next time.",4
"Best martini in Madison--cold, dry,with crisp, fresh olives. Chicken Parmigiana is outstanding. Lighting is a bit muted for easy reading of their menus, but wait staff is always professional with the proper level of attention. The shrimp Frangelico salad is  a winner. Interesting choice of sauces on their signature steak dishes.",3
Its a good place to go for happy hour. Good drink specials as well as inexpensive appetizers.  If you are in the North Scottsdale area I would suggest going and sitting on the patio and doing a little people watching and enjoying some sushi and drinks.,3
"Nothing good to say. One of the drivers almost hit my car on street. When we stop , almost side by side, he opened his mini van door and he started saying things to me. What kind of philosophy have this company ??? Probably rude and unprofessional people.",0
"Beautiful remodel.\nSmells delicious... bvulgari\n\nHakkasan opened and it is gorgeous. We nibbled different cantonese dishes. I really enjoyed the spicy wagyu beef, and the black pepper ribeye. Every veggie side dish is yummy\n\nWe saw deadmau5 and it is a great platform for DJs. I really enjoyed the entertainment portion, it really is a beautiful experience and it was nice that dinner rolled into the evening without lines, etc\n\nThere is a gift shop before the elevators that sells homemade large cupcakes for $4.00, but after 10:00pm they are $2.00. I usually love red velvet but the oreo is amazing",3

"Where's Tabitha when you need her?!?\nThis place needs a makeover....\nNobody said hello to my wife...\nThen a lady said \""Did you sign in?\"" after we sat down....we watched her curl her hair for 10 minutes while the other stylist played on her phone with her bare feet up on the station counter....when done curling lady #1 said come over....\nShe asked my wife what style she wanted and 60 seconds later was cutting hair!!\nShe didn't ask if she wanted wash/blow dry....\nAwful 1st impression!",1
"The food here is excellent, but the service is even better! Came here with my coworkers before a performance at Symphony Hall. We had such a great waitress--Audrey. She was so attentive to our table, helpful in picking our meals and not overbearing or trying to take our plates before we were finished. \n\nFor our appetizers, we got the yelp deal for the free chicken lettuce wraps--omg, those were to die for! The dried fruit and almonds gave them a sweet AND savory taste. My coworker got the garlic/spicy hummus combo, SO delish, too! \n\nFor my meal, I had the pistachio pesto caesar salad and absolutely loved it...perfect portion, filling and very tasty. \n\nWill definitely come back to this spot! So glad we had Audrey as a waitress!! :)",4

The sandwiches are delicious!  Don't forget the cheesecake.,3
"Bait and Switch.\n\nWe called to ask about window tint because their website doesn't list their prices, and after we told them what we wanted and what kind of car we had, they told us it would be $250 which included a free car wash. Sounded okay, so we made the journey up to NoSco.\n\nWhen we got there, they tried to upsell us on a detailing to get rid of the water spots - well, won't the fucking car wash take care of that or is it extra if we actually want it to be clean? Then we started talking to someone who was more of a manager or whatever and he directed us to a price sheet - 600 bucks for our car. WTF? \n\nI told him they told us something wildly different on the phone and he denied having much to do with that. I let him know I was more upset with the people on the phone than with him - he offered to drop prices a little on what we actually wanted after trying to give us a demonstration on the effectiveness of the tint (we already know, that's why we came all the way out here). \n\nWe were almost going to leave, but he offered to drop his price on the cheap stuff they sell so we went ahead and took it. We still paid a little more than we would have elsewhere for the same thing, but at least we have a warranty now.\n\nThey finished with our car an hour early and ended up charging us extra for the wash which was supposed to be included. Whatever - they did a good job. Time will tell if this stuff holds up - we were happy with what we got... it's better than no tint. \n\nAfter we paid, we went to gas up and their pump kept glitching out on us so we just decided to say \""fuck it\"" and get the hell out of dodge. In retrospect, we should've taken a road trip to California and had it done cheaper while on vacation. Also, I think that this place looks too corporate to have to word \""family\"" in the name... seems a little misleading. Three stars is a positive review - it's nearly a four. I'm just sour on the price thing and the upselling and the hidden fees and the retarded gas pumps.",2
"Horrible service and lousy food. I went 3 times (breakfast, lunch, and dinner) thinking that it would get better, but each time got worse. Name tags on the food were not changed from brunch to dinner, so I had no idea what half the food was. Long lines just to get in and rude hostesses. Food was not being refilled fast enough to meet demand. Never again!",0
"One of the things that I wanted to do when I hit town was scrape around to a few different sides of town - and while I didn't have as much time as I would have liked to explore Dilworth, I did make it a point to grab dinner here on my way out for the evening. \n\nWhat I found was a perfectly cozy corner stop, featuring what appeared to be a decent wine list, a carefully selected cadre of brews, and a menu full of rich new American staples. 131 Main won't refresh your take on modern American cuisine, but it might well remind you what you like about it. I had my way with the roasted chicken, paired with some really surprisingly tangy braised cabbage, and washed the whole thing down with an Olde Copper brew. Whether you're content to warm up to the bar and savor a glass of wine or belly up like I did and tear into a new take on some classic fare, there's a decent chance this spot will send you on your way smiling.",3
"The service sucks. Waitress took over 10 minutes to come take our order. Two other servers came by, saw we were waiting n trying to order, but refused to take our order n said our server would be coming. Lame service right there . Waitress finally came , totally sour attitude. (We hadn't even complained ). She disappeared again. Had to flag her down just to get the check . On top of all that, the music was horrible. Bad rap and country n I don't even know what category music. All in all, def not coming back. On the up side, my margarita was strong so left w a buzz :)",0
"One star off what would've been a five-star good time because of the cigarette fog hanging in the air at the Western. It's so thick you can practically sink your teeth into it. If they have a ventilation system it is in desperate need of an overhaul, it probably stopped working back in the 70s.\n\nThe casino is mostly machines, but there are a few table games. Playing can be incredibly cheap ($1 blackjack). There's a snack bar on hand with the usual greasy fare, but my rec is to eat before you go. What food I saw looked sketchy at best. The drinks are CHEAP: $1 beers, $1.50 cocktails.\n\nSunday night karaoke is held in a corner of the casino and provides free entertainment for anyone willing to listen. The crowd attending is a combination of people looking for a cheap good time and characters who you just know are waiting all week for what they firmly believe is their turn in the spotlight.  If you're lucky you'll get a program as diverse as the one I heard with friends on our first visit: Native American chants performed acapella, \""That's Life\"" done as William Shatner-style spoken word, and at least half a dozen Patsy Cline weepers. One take on Marvin Gaye's immortal \""Let's Get It On\"" had the whole lounge area up and out of their chairs squealing. And the man who chose an Earth Wind & Fire song he didn't know, we were glad to sing his song for him from our seats.\n\nI was fortunate enough to be with a group, and I wouldn't go to the Western any other way. Not everyone there looks like they're just after just a good time. Anything you might be nervous about losing, leave it at home.  And keep an eye on your drink if you order one. EW&F guy also spent the evening wandering around asking if he'd left his drink behind and claiming other people's drinks. (He got in some serious trouble for this after he ganked the wrong woman's Corona.)\n\nTry to see the whole thing from the right perspective, otherwise you're missing a classic Las Vegas treasure. And fortify yourself with antihistamines if you're sensitive to smoke at all, as I plan to before my next karaoke night visit.",3
"What can I say? I have a thing for seeing wax figures, even if I was traumatized for life by the one in Hollywood at the tender age of 6. Elvira looked dead real! Well, dead alive...wat.\n\nOn the other hand, Jeff L. is still deadly afraid of wax figurines resembling people he would otherwise gawk at if they were that close in real life. For me, it provides an opportunity to pose in rude ways to people who have more money then me. That or sexy ways, it depends. Michael Jackson still kind of scares me.\n\nAll of this said and done, a las the pictures of this momentous occasion are no longer with me since my computer got stolen the month before and I didn't back them up. I only have the one of me and Hugh Hefner to prove...nothing.",3
"I feel the need to review this Starbucks because, well, when I was in there, it was without a doubt the most disgusting coffee shop I've ever seen (and I've worked for that generic 'independent' coffee shop we all know).  I've been a student for ages now and have been to many a Starbucks in my day and this is, by far, the nastiest one I've seen.  I hate to knock a place purely for how it looks, but when the tables are nasty, there's dust on the windowsills, and food debris everywhere....it doesn't seem that appetizing.  I know it may be a recession and you're suffering but seriously, clean up your act Starbucks.",0
"Horrible service.  They try to nickel and dime you.    Chicken portions are extremely meager.  When I asked for a normal size portion of chicken, they tried to add an additional $2.   The staff is extremely rude.  Don't ever come here.",0
"You've no doubt heard of Schwartz's... well... forget all the hype, bypass all the tourists... and head across the street to where (almost) everyone is a local. They have the same stuff as Schwartz's... but better.  Yes... you heard me right... BETTER. Don't believe me? Go try a smoked meat sandwich from here... give it an honest try... and tell me I'm wrong. I dare you.",4
"We finally decided to visit Serendipity 3 after hearing all the hype.  It's December so the place wasn't as packed as what we thought it would be.  There was no wait and we were promptly seated on the patio.\n\nWe used a coupon to get a free frozen hot chocolate after ordering an entree.  The waitress was kind enough to tell us that we can also order the burgers or sandwiches instead of the entree.  However, we still opted for the bbq ribs.  The frozen hot chocolate was interesting, but probably doesn't worth the $11.  It's good that we got it for free.  The ribs were huge and very delicious.  For dessert, we ordered the deep fried oreo sundae topped with marshmallow sauce.  While it was very good, it also felt very wrong with all the calorie intake.  We ended only finishing half and I bet that was 10000 calories.  \n\nOverall, the place and food were very interesting.  \n\nMinus 1 star for the price, it's a bit high, even for Las Vegas.",3
"It's been a while since I've been into Bill Johnson's. The first thing I noticed was that they had removed the sawdust from floor. I always thought that that was a cool trademark of theirs. The food we received was average to below average. The fries were soggy. The mayonnaise was served to us in squeeze packets, that seemed to be old. The service was mediocre at best.\nI'm sure that it will be a long time before we go back there again.",1
"We tried Modern Margarita on a weeknight and didn't read the reviews beforehand, but as many previous commenters have noted, it was So Loud! The music was way too loud for a restaurant. It wasn't a Saturday night at a club!\n\nBesides the music, we had a pretty decent experience. The margaritas were good. We ordered a salsa flight, which was ok but it really seems they should offer complimentary chips and salsa. Alas, we had to pay for mediocre salsa and they were small portions so we had to pay again when we requested more. \n\nWe ordered tacos and a salad and both were decent. I'm not sure this will become a regular place for us but we'll likely try it at least once more before we write it off totally. In the meantime, turn down that music!",2
"After 4+ bids for an AC Unit, I went with AccuTemp.  Matt was helpful and honest.  He gave us time to do our research and answered all our questions.  The installers were professional and although a mistake was made, they came out quickly upon realizing there was a problem and corrected their mistake.  Mike was on top of it and wanted us to know that they stood behind their work.  Hopefully there will be no more problems in the future but should there be, I am sure they will be there to help and fix them.",4
Michala was our server tonight. As busy as it was she didn't miss a beat. Great service! Thank you,4
"Never again!  We had our choice of restaurants and chose this one over 5 others in the Miracle Mile Mall.  Horrible food.  We were sat down right away and then went for our food.  I could not finish one item and tried many.  We wanted to order drinks, but our server must have finished his shift and never saw him again.  Our plates and the plates of other customers piled up and nobody was clearing.  Again, the food was really bad.  Save you money and go somewhere else.  I would not eat here again, even if it was free which it was this time.",0
"I've been coming to Sambalatte once a month for about two years. I live on the opposite side of the city, but this is an excellent place for me to meet up with friends who live in Summerlin. The coffee and specialty drinks can tend to be a bit more pricy than you're used to at other coffee shops, but I've never been disappointed with quality. The staff has also been kind and courteous on each trip. While I don't recommend this for your every day coffee habit, Sambalatte is a nice indulgence.",3
"I think one's experience with any post office depends on the time of day you go. Having it be crowded during the Christmas season compared to 1:40p in the afternoon in mid January will be two different experiences. I must say I have been pleased with my visits thus far. \n\nStaff at the counter have been helpful and try not to rush you. That is great, except when there is a longer line. Great service can slow down the waiting time. Nice clean facility, stocked up nicely with shopping supplies. All in all, 4 stars.",3
"Swanky, stylish decor!  Attentive service, stylish plating.  Limited sushi menu but they have options.  I had their 6 course tasting menu.  Very nice.  Miso soup a bit too salty for me, but others might like. Ginger ice cream was delicious, though, atop bread pudding. Cool bathroom, too.",2
"Still quite poor both in service and food. maybe I made a mistake and ordered Sichuan Gong Bao ji ding for what seemed like people from canton district. Unfortunately to get the good service U have to speak Mandarin/Cantonese. I do speak a smattering but try not to use it as I never feel confident about the intonation. \n\nThe dish came out with zichini and bell peppers (what!??)  Where is the peanuts the dried fried red peppers and the large pieces of scallion. On pointing this out all I got was \"" Oh you like peanuts.. ok I will put some on\"" and she then proceeded to get some peanuts and sprinkle it on the chicken.\n\nWell at that point I was happy that atleast the chicken pieces were present else she would probably end up sprinkling raw chicken pieces on it like the raw peanuts she dumped on top of the food. \n\nWell then  I spoke a few chinese words and the scowl turned into a smile and she then became a bit more friendlier. \n\nUnfortunately I do not condone this type of behavior. It is all in poor taste...",0
"This place is a perfect place to go when everyone is ready for a carb-loading type of dinner the night before an intense workout or marathon! Lol \n\nThe food here are freshly made.  Pomodoro Fresco with capers and shrimp is such a good combo !!!!  When you order something with shrimp, it's actually fresh raw shrimp that they grill up  not frozen and heated up.  \n\nAfter your meal there's a Golden Spoon you can hit up for dessert :P",3
"My son went to McCormick Preschool from 6 weeks old until after he started school and he loved it there.  The kids are in separate classrooms, with kids the same age, learning valuable educational and social skills.  My son benefited greatly from the teachers at McCormick and still remembers all of them, especially getting his Red Vines when he left everyday from Ms. Barbara.  Most of the teachers there are career teachers and not just showing up for work every day.  They really care about the kids who go there.\n\nThe school has Christmas parties every year with families, food and a visit from Santa.  Holidays are all celebrated with parties full of hand-made decorations, songs, crafts and costumes!  Lots of photos are taken of the kids so parents can share in their growth and daytime activities.  Besides being a really fun place for the kids to be, the McCormick Preschool van gives the kids rides to and from school everyday.  This service made it possible for me to work an uninterrupted day while my son was taken care of for the entire day.   There was even a graduation ceremony with a cap and gown!\n\nI read a REALLY long and negative review on Yelp about McCormick and have to wonder if someone that worries about bacteria in the dirt their child plays in could ever be satisfied with someone else's care of her child.  I have always taken my child's safety very seriously, but that's just weird.\n\nMcCormick Preschool is an amazing school and even though my son graduated a few years ago, I am still proud to have the school in my neighborhood.\n\nI recommend McCormick Preschool 100%!",4
"Had an initial detail and bi-weekly washes. Went well for a couple months and then they stopped showing up. On that day I had left the cover off my car, and by the next day the sprinklers got to it, rendering the $200 detail completely ruined.",1
"This used to be my FAVORITE place to eat.  Today that sadly ended. First, they might be under new owners as the menu changed and the taste was a little different.  But, the worst thing that happened when I went today was that a saw a HUGE roach. The chef came out 2-3 times to try to kill it. he also used the word again, making me think this wasn't a new problem.  And, the worst part was that he asked the customer who pointed it out if she was scared of it. Um, I am scared that it has likely run around my food and nested in the ingera before you gave it to me.  So gross that you don't see to care!!!",0
Stopped in here when we visited Phoenix.  Great food and lots of it.,4
"Wish I could give no stars. Just left this joke of a restaurant. Walked out shaking with anger after the service we got is more accurate. \nWaited in line for 25 mins. Busy holiday weekend - not bothered by that. \nWaited to see a waitress for 20 mins and then after making the excuse that they're busy, but others were seated after us, we kinda lost it. We had seen two tables get served when they were seated after us. The icing on the cow-pie is that the waitress (tall blond woman) argued w is about it and told us to leave if we didn't like it.\nThere was no manager on duty to even complain to!  \n\nFine. Buh-bye!",0
"What's so great about this place? This seems to be the only pho place Vegas people go to. Always busy, but the food isn't even that great. Shame!",1
"the quick and dirty - on a great place\n\nAtmosphere: Cafe Vasco Da Gama (henceforth referred to as CVDG) has been around for a while.  A cafe that serves food, it's offend crowded with couples and busy working professionals - its a great place to see and be seen and ironically one can even hide away here! (go to the back!)\n\nFood: Tunal Burger?! Yes please - a specialty of the place, CVDG surges paninis, soups, deserts and coffee that are both temptingly good and filling.  Never had a bad meal here.\n\nService: since the place can be quite crowded, be prepared to wait a little bit to be seated.  Choices are made in person at the counter, and food is delivered to you once its ready.  Minimal service, but always pleasant and courteous.\n\nPop in for a bit during the work day but my favourite time to visit is during the early hours of Sat / Sun - people are a lot more relaxed and there's a general sense of easy about the place as people are inclined to be a lot more mellow.  Summer times even bring a few outdoor tables for some open air render-vous\n\nYou should go :)",3
"After reading Rayan D's review of this, it struck me despite that I pass the St James Shopping Centre often, and I have strong dislike to it, I had never thought to review it.\n\nMuch like Rayan says, it is a very large, 70's style building that, given the other gorgeous architecture on Princes St (Jenners, the Scots' Monument, and the Scotsman Hotel right opposite) it is something of a monstrosity.\n\nIt also, as far as shopping centres go, doesn't have much in it. It's one of those centres I find myself going to, wandering through, and then not quite understanding why I went. It does have one of the entrances into John Lewis - of an entirely different ilk. And it also leads into Multress Walk, which is again on a completely different scale. The bus station is also very close.\n\nIt just feels very dated and old. Perhaps in its time it was new, and filled with new shops. Now it feels like they are just filling the retail units in order to keep it full. The Boots in it isn't a great Boots. The River Island in it isn't a great River Island. Both of these can be found 150 metres up Princes Street, and are much nicer.\n\nSorry St James. Ill wander through you to get from St Andrews Square to Broughton Street in order to shelter from the rain - but that's it.",1
"It is disappointing to write this... I don't do many reviews, something has to be great or really poor to warrant it. I grew up going to monti's when Leonard was still running things... And it was perfect... Always. \n\nNow things have changed. In our last 5 visits, (over about a year period), we have been consistently disappointed. Last night we went and they \""were out of bread\"". It was 5:30pm, the dinner rush hadn't even started! Then when we ordered I was informed it is $1 to get a salad as a side... (I agreed but it seemed silly since I have done that for 25+ years). My steak was ordered rare and her's medium rare. Mine came out med well and hers medium+ (mine also came with mashed potatoes when I ordered baked). Our waitress was friendly, but they have stepped their prices up so much that they are competing with the big boys. At $30 for a steak, ($110 for dinner for 2 with a couple drinks), they are no where near the quality of others in that price range (Flemings, Ruth's cross et al). Gone are monti's glory days. Too bad too since we live less than 200m away.",1
"We checked in about two hours ago & called 40 mins in to let them know the AC in our room is down not to mention the fridge is messed up also. They insisted an engineer would come to \""look at it\"". Also, the lady at the front desk specifically stated we would be able to access the wifi from our room. I stated it only popped up on our phones in the lobby. She stated that I should call some number and they can redirect us to get it done manually. \n\nWe requested to change rooms. They stated they're completely booked this weekend. Hah, funny..... Because we just checked to book another room and it allowed us. \n\nHORRIBLE customer service. First time staying here & most likely the last. Waste of time sitting around waiting for someone to come as well as wasting time speaking to useless reps.\n\nAside from all this, we also found dirty used dishes stowed away in the cabinet.  They were hidden as if guests were to look past them and not notice.  \n\nTotally disappointing.  I have been looking forward to staying at this hotel for a while now.",0
"Bad Donkey is the north Phoenix answer to Cheba Hut.

Good eats!\n\nCute place, good food and a very friendly staff.",4
"3.5 stars:\n\nWe really enjoyed this show and since I was a smart girl and got our tickets through Goldstarevents.com, we didn't pay the $85.00 per ticket the box office wanted. Having never really watched any Penn and Teller and knowing my guy loves magic, this was a perfect type of show for us. I would have been pissed paying more than we did as the show only lasted 80 minutes, but it was quite creative and I liked learning how they did certain things. \n\nI also liked that both Penn and Teller stood out front of their theatre and signed autographs and took pictures. It is rare for \""celebrities\"" to do this now a days. I don't think I would need to see them again, but I am glad I got to this trip for sure.",2
"Last week, we were sitting at the bar and my friend lost her diamond wedding band.  We began searching and other patrons noticed and began hunting as well.  It was dark and we were on hands and knees.  I asked Christopher, the owner, if he could turn up the lights in order to see better  and he said no.  After 10 minutes, a stranger helping found the ring.  How disappointing to see an owner act in this manner.",0
"Clean restaurant and friendly staff. \n\nOrdered shaken beef, spring rolls and pho dac biet.  \n\nOverall the food is good.  The pho broth could be hotter and a little more robust but the flank, tendon, tripe where all good. \n\nRecommended.",3
As of right now terrible experience. wouldn't recommend it to anyone!,0
"So let me start off by saying I'm Vietnamese. \n\nThe good: they give you lots of meat in your Pho.\n\nThe bad: the broth was not very good. I'd give it a 3/10, it was cloudy, salty, and probably not fresh.\n\nThe really bad: the banh xeo here is quite literally the worst i've ever had in my -entire life-. Not only was the batter terrible, but it appears that they may have just pre-made the \""shell\"" and baked it, microwaved some bean sprouts and shoved it in there.\n\nMy advice: go to Jenni Pho or Que Huong instead.\n\nThe only reason this review does not have a 1-star is because those are reserved for restaurants that give me food poisoning or are filthy.",1
"DO NOT EAT HERE.\n\nIf I could give this place no stars whatsoever, then I would. (1) Our waitress was slow and forgetful. They were either understaffed or overbooked but neither is a good excuse for poor service. (2) My husband found a women's hair in his salad bar items and/or baked into the cheese biscuit, which we *might* have overlooked BUT... (3) A mouse was running in and out of the wine cellar area behind us and into the restaurant - a mere 20 feet away from the kitchen. \n\nAs if that wasn't bad enough, the staff and manager's reactions were horrifying: First, they did not seem to care or mind that a rodent was running loose. It was almost as if they knew about the problem before it happened. (2) I had to actually persuade the manager to take care of our bill. Unfortunately, his solution was to only slightly discount our meal rather than completely comping it. We're not the type of couple to ever ask for freebies - I even offered to pay for the wine, hoping to suggest that we were not inclined to pay for a meal after such a horrifying experience. To make matters worse, we saw the hair and the mouse after finishing eating. Had we seen it before gorging on food, we would have simply finished our wine and left. What an awful feeling to realize after ingesting an entire meal that your food was prepared in wholly unsanitary conditions - not to mention the kick in the face of shelling out $100+ after everything that happened. \n\nThis was a completely unacceptable meal experience. Before this all happened, we discussed possibly going back and/or taking friends or family but we will NEVER step foot in there again. Disgusting.\n\n**SINCE WRITING THIS REVIEW, THE ALLEGHENY HEALTH DEPARTMENT DID AN INSPECTION: http://hdas01.achd.net/reports/rwservlet?food_rep_insp&P_ENCOUNTER=201401230037\n\n**Texas De Brazil corporate office have been unresponsive.",0
"\""If you build it, they will come\"" - but maybe not to Chase Field, well... unless the team is winning of course. But even then, they will only come depending on the food options and free promotions available to them on that particular day. \n \nAlright Diamondbacks Nation... well maybe not nation, maybe Diamondbacks fans? Nope, there aren't enough of you for that title either. What about supporters? Maybe groupies? Well whatever you're called, where are you? You've got one gorgeous baseball field and a World Series title, yet this stadium sits lifelessly in the Arizona desert.\n \nIt's sad actually. Chase Field is gorgeous, and dare I say... breathtaking. Stretching far and wide across the Phoenix skyline, Chase Field stands tall among the buildings that call downtown Phoenix home. This technological work of art brought baseball to the desert, and that's quite a feat. Even some of baseballs greatest players, like The Big Unit for example, have called it home. Sparkling clean and strategically situated for easy access and parking, Chase Field calls out to \""D-Backs fans\"" - begging them to venture though its towering gated entrance to seek sanctuary within its cool climate controlled atmosphere. All of the vendors, ushers and ballpark staff at this stadium are also welcoming, helpful and friendly. There isn't a bad seat at Chase Field. The view is virtually perfect from every angle. Yet the seats remain fan-less. \n \nI do understand part of the reason why fans don't flock to Chase Field. An empty stadium is a common transplant state/expansion team symptom, like the desolate Tropicana Field for example. Most people in Arizona probably aren't even \""D-Backs fans\"". I get that. I'm not one. But even I pay more attention to the action at Chase Field and have more admiration of its beauty than a majority of those \""D-Backs fans.\"" \n\nIt is as if \""D-Backs fans\"" are confused, and they think Chase Field is an indoor shopping mall - because in between the shopping, the food, the activities, the awful emcee that talks in between innings, the dancing and the trivia games, none of the \""D-Backs fans\"" seem to have time to watch baseball.  \n\nSo \""D-Backs fans\"" - you need to up your appreciation level for the game. It's the roar of the crowd that brings a stadium to life. Team pride is what makes or breaks a ballpark's atmosphere. And when you are talking on your phone through an entire at bat, standing up right in the middle of a crucial pitch to get more ballpark chow or allowing your children to turn empty seats into their own personal jungle gym or hide and go seek game, why even come to the stadium? Go to the mall or visit a park for that matter. Regardless of whether you're in first place or last place, this is your team in your city. It's not enjoyable to see such beauty go to waste. So stop swimming in your indoor ballpark pool (I still can't believe how tacky that pool looks in the outfield), worry about what ice cream extravaganza you are going to stuff your face with later, and let's watch some baseball! \n \nIt's called game time \""D-Backs fans\"", not play time.",2
"As an East Coast girl, I have to say that I prefer Five Guys, where not only are the burgers good, but the fries are decent. In-N-Out Burger's fries are pale and pasty, not golden and crispy. But yes, the burgers are good, plus \""animal style\"" is fun, etc etc.\n\nThe key here is that (to reiterate previous reviews) you CAN walk from the Strip, but it takes about 30 minutes and is difficult to figure out, because Vegas off-strip isn't designed for pedestrians. You're literally crossing a highway, and only one side of the street has sidewalk. And it's not the side that has the In-N-Out Burger.\n\nAnd yes it was very busy, but we didn't have wait too too long.",3
"I bought a groupon, made an appointment, and saw Rachel- the owner and stylist. She gave me exactly the cut and color I wanted! She is definitely very knowledgeable and she is easy to talk to. I left feeling fabulous, and will definitely be back! On top of offering a top-notch service, Rachel's prices and incredibly reasonable. I plan on becoming a regular.",4
"This place has helped me get away from more mainstream coffee shops... Now, when I have coffee some other place, I use Sunrise as a comparison! It is a bit of a drive from my home, but it is absolutely worth it! I always get the London Fog with almond milk, and their egg croissant sandwich is to die for! Everything is fresh and free from being microwaved. Keep up the amazing work!!",4
"My first time here was WAY better. I guess things can change for the worse over time. \n\nSeriously, what buffet doesn't have ham? I thought that was a requirement at Vegas buffets. When I came here the first time, they had this delicious honey baked ham and a coconut macaroon for dessert! It was one of the best macaroons I've ever had. Now, the only thing I like is their prime rib and that's not even that great. For $40 per person, I expected more. I mean, I'm not asking for fireworks, but at least put some more effort into it like you did before. VERY disappointed.",2
"I get very excited about going to the Market at the Square but not excited enough to get there before 10 o'clock. That's not a knock on the Market, but is more a function of my love for sleep.\n\nThough today (mid-May), they only had asparagus, the selection rounds out toward the end of the summer. I particularly enjoy sweet corn around late August. \n\nPrices are a little bit higher here but it feels good to buy locally and I really like how, in my experience, everything's been super fresh. I also like how there's a lot of non-produce stuff like meat, cheese, bread, etc.\n\nAll in all, Market at the Square is a great place to go.",4
"Unexpectedly delightful ice cream in a strip mall location (like just about all my good finds in Phoenix).   Honestly, I was just looking for a quick break and much needed sugar on the drive back from (sleep deprived) days in Vegas...what I found was one of the best ice cream I've had in Phoenix.\n\nThis little independent gem does it all...ice cream, gelato, mix-ins...and Karen was amazingly friendly and overwhelmingly generous with all her samples.  I was told that she makes everything herself on site.  Everything I tried was super tasty...but the one flavor that can get me in my car and back to Surprise would be Red Velvet.\n\nPricing is a bit different here...you pay for ice cream by the weight rather than by the scoop...great for me since I really do prefer little scoops....lots and lots of little scoops",3
"I have visited this museum several times.  Recently, they have made some improvements that took the well intentioned but well worn facility and exhibits up a notch.\n\nThe builder's exhibit, village area and new entry separate from the library were big improvements, in terms of freshened exhibits that the children enjoyed, and providing a separate entry to separate the library patrons from families accessing the museum.\n\nI really hope the Lied Discovery Children's Museum keeps improving its exhibits and facilities so it ultimately becomes a world class facility.  This museum is a great asset to Las Vegas.",2
"Slow and overall bad service. Server didn't come when my party sat down. Waited 5-10min and we had to flag down someone to get us started. Drinks came pretty slowly as well. Salad bar is alright. Meat was either salty, tough, or overcooked in general. We asked for different types of meat, cause only 4 circulated to us over the 1.5 hours we were there. Tried to pay the bill, had to wait so long just to get it. And forever to get the cards processed too (split bill). Avoid.",0
"Sacks is a nice little sandwich shop that gets a nice semi-fancy sandwich right with out being too full of themselves.\nThey have a decent selection of pre-configured sandwiches without giving too many confusing choices... Each one is unique and not just a change of bread or meat from any of the others.  You order/configure your own sandwich any way you like and they have many unique sandwich ingredients.  Although I didn't have their soup this last time I visted, it has been very good in the past.   I wouldn't try to bring a group of more than 4 to the place, they have seating, but not a lot of it.",3
"I'm not a vegetarian nor a raw food person, but my love for beautifully fresh (or beautifully cooked) veggies rivals, and on certain days surpasses, my love for meat.  On one such day I decided to try out Luna's for lunch with a work friend.\n\nI was not disappointed in the least. The staff was polite but distant; however, the quality of the meal overshadowed their... translucency. I ordered the raw veggie lasagna (\""Lunasagna\"") and it was delicious.  The tomato sauce was especially tasty. The lemonade I had with it was refreshing as well: made with real lemons and not cloyingly sweet.\n\nLuna's is a little on the expensive side, and from my experience at least, it's not the place to go if you want to make small talk with the staff. But the food is delicious and healthy, and if that's what you want, you should check it out. I know I'll be back every once in a while.",3
"Came in here for a spur of the moment casual dinner.  Despite most tables already having been reserved (incl. window-side couples seats), the staff greeted us with a friendly face and were more than accommodating to find us a table.  They just requested the table back by a certain time, giving us over a hour which we were more than fine with.  I personally liked the menu for meandering off typical fare (stewed rabbit, rolled lamb neck, chicken liver risotto).  For the less adventuresome, good ol steak and fish n chips are also on offer.  The skirlie that comes on side with the rabbit, is so far one of the best I've tried thus far (its rival is at a b&b up in Isle of Harris).  \n\nVibe of this place works, at least in the main front room where we were seated.  Staff were informative & friendly.  For a casual yet intimate dinner, food & experience was above par.  We will be back again, and next time we are tackling the dinosaur of a ribeye for two ;)",2
"Well, this place has had plenty of time to get they're act together.  The service is horrible!  Food is just ok, which is sad because when they opened they got 4 stars from me.  I'm surprised that they're still in business but there isn't a whole lot of options here. The chips n Salsa/Bean Dip is yummy but that's it. Keep searching!",1
"Why is there ALWAYS a freakin' line out the door? Don't you think they could figure out that having 1 customer service agent during a peak time is a bad idea?! It doesn't help that everyone that works here seems to hate their job... *Le sigh*\n\nPro tip: If you only need to ship an item, print shipping labels at home or use the machine out front. Save yourself some headache.",1
"Chocolate cafe? Oh yes! Very cute shop with a huge intensive menu related to chocolate! I ordered a milk chocolate called \""New Guinea\"" paired with a little chocolate-banana brownie. I would sip the chocolate drink and take a little bite of the brownie. It was superb and must be enjoyed slowly. I mean, what's the rush anyways? Enjoy!",4
"Alex, Trevor (if those are your real names) marry me.  My best friend and I went to this nightclub/stripclub not knowing what to expect.  I have to admit, when I saw the inside I was a bit nervous: incredibly low lighting, peeling paint.  But then we saw the boys.  And then we saw them move.  And then it was love.  They were very upfront about their pricing, they were adorable, sexy as hell, and grateful for the money we gave them.  They were upbeat, flexible, charming, flexible, and even gave us a little extra time in the room for free.  But maybe that's just because we had genuine chemistry...one can dream.  Needless to say, we're going back again tonight.  Music was great, prices were decent, the boys were hot enough to put smiles on our faces for the rest of the night and quite frankly the rest of the trip.",3
"A little pricey for the quality of the food.  I paid $20 for breakfast that consisted of 2 eggs, breakfast potatoes, bacon and coffee.  I can get that at IHOP or Denny's MUCH cheaper, but I mainly paid for convienence.  We were in a hurry to eat before going to the Hoover Dam.  I also had a BLT here and it was just Meh.  The Paris has MUCH better eating places to offer so I'd skip it personally.",2
"I am definately a fan of Michael Mina.  I've been to this location several times.  Agree that the Lobster Pot Pie is incredible, along with the service.  HOWEVER - this location just doesn't hold a candle to San Francisco's Michael Mina, which is the ultimate dining experience.",3
"Ready for girly omg-my-wedding-photographer-was-so-awesome gushiness? Yeah? Good, cos here we go.\n\nFirst let me just say, I like Tonya. A lot. She's hilarious, confident, cute, and extremely personable. Southern Belle-ish with a healthy dose of punkrawk. I also like Tonya's photography a lot - it, too, is hilarious, colorful, poppy. She loves crooked angles, peeling sign paint, pirates, graffiti, and bright colors, so her taste and mine align. \n\nBut it's the Loooove and zeal she has for shooting that really makes her special. She gets into a zone and just goes and goes, gets the most cantakerous gramps to smile for el camara, cuts a lame joke to get a real smile (and it works! time after time!), all while showing up at every damn moment of your entire weekend, cute outfit on, camera in hand, smiling and hugging and buying you cocktails and telling you you're gorgeous. \n\nAll for a reasonable price. Effing awesome.",4
"As I sit here waiting another 20 minutes for my dessert I am wondering if the food is worth coming here for.  I say absolutely not! Yes the food is good but, we arrived at 7:30 and are just now leaving after 9. Funny how each waitress walked by time and time again just ignoring us but,  when it's time to pay she came right back.  Will never come here again!",1
"Stopped Saturday late afternoon for one $4 beer. Ran the beer & $1 tip on my check debit card...for a total of $5.\n\nWas shell shocked on the following Tuesday to see Badgerbowl actually charged $104 to my account!!\n\nI immediately called.  While they admitted it was there error, no actual apology was given.  I gave my card info over the phone as she said she would immediately refund the money.  She said \""this kind of thing happens all the time.\""  WHAT??\n\nThe next morning, I couldn't see the money in my account, so called the manager.  He told me it would take 24-48 hours before it would show, but he ASSURED me it had been taken care of.  \n\nLater that afternoon, I get a call from someone else at Badger Bowl.  Apparently, yesterday they really only credited $5 to my account out of the $100 they overcharged me (WHAT??  They still expect me to pay for the beer after all of this??? But, whatever...)\n\nBecause they only credited me $5, she needed by card info again to run the remaining $95 credit.  At this point I requested a check as I do not trust them or this process at all.\n\nAnd instead of being apologetic..at all...about this HUGE error, she was actually quite defensive, I can all assume, because \""this happens all the time.\""\n\nBeware.  Pay with cash.   Hold onto your receipts.",0
"The food is amazing, why can't they fix the service?  ...and yet, I keep returning to torture my guests and me.  One would think that at 3:00 in the afternoon, there would be no issues.  We had a business meeting and decided to sit on the patio which was, despite being a perfect day in the valley, empty.  Once seated, it took 25 minutes for 3 ice teas, another 30 minutes for the prosciutto and chevre flat bread (which, oops, had no chevre), and another 30 minutes for the bill.  Our business meeting was only an hour in an attempt to avoid rush hour traffic home...we failed miserably at the task.  Anyway, Olive and Ivy still receives 4 stars from me because of their food and ambiance.  Just be prepared to wait and be served something you didn't order.  Sam Fox, fix this place before you open another.",3
food is really just ok. they must improve otherwise when other restaurants open at Downtown Summerlin it would be hard for them to survive...,1
"Some friends and I hosted a baby shower at 300 East and had the BEST experience! We looked at having it at several places but one conversation with Mike at 300 East sealed the deal for us.  He was extremely helpful and responsive through the planning process and we were given a wonderful open area upstairs to gather.  Plus, unlike many Charlotte restaurants (read Amelie's), they did not charge us for the space! I highly recommend 300 East for a special event and will definitely host one there again.",4
"Food was great! However, I gave my debit card number over the phone and then the delivery guy (dressed in a auto body shop uniform) ask to make an imprint of my card number. Stupid me let him do it as he made a big deal about people stealing card info from customers. I kept the receipt and about two weeks later $300 was taking out of my account from an ATM located 21 miles away from where I live. My bank informed me that there were six attempts to withdraw money at one time and then the person figured out my PIN number. Be cautious when giving this place of business any bank information!!!!!",0
"I'm not sure if it's the ambiance or the lack of excitement that removed a star. We've been to the one under the Brooklyn bridge where we waited 2 hours to get a seat, in the hot July heat at the concrete jungle that is New York. Coming here, the place wasn't packed. It took awhile to walk around and try to find it in the Palazzo when the Palazzo isn't typically a place we would stop in for. \n\nWe got seated on the deck area facing the hallways. We watched a guy passed out and security trying to get him to move. He was clearly intoxicated and on a few other stuff. It was amusing to watch while we wait for our pizza. \n\nWe shared an extra large pizza with basil, their buffalo mozzarella and some pepperonis. It was delicious but I guess the fact that it wasn't in NY had something to do with it to deflate my excitement a bit. The waitress had a strong italian accent that really appealed to my father-in-law (who is Italian). \n\nWe've been dying to try this place in Vegas so craving fulfilled!",3
"As many yelpers have said perfectly...the Village Green is the idealistic neighborhood tap.  I hadn't been in over 10 years, and walking back in the place looked exactly the same.  Some would call it a bad thing, but I find it endearing.  We've been back a few times now and love going with friends for a casual Friday night.  Great specials (love the Friday fish...but be prepared to eat only fried food).  My all-time favorite is their summer sausage reuben...if you love reubens you cannot go wrong with this jewel!  Fries are always hot and fresh and service is always friendly.  One of Middleton's best kept local secrets!",3
"Terrible service, worst manager I've ever experience,.  This is the first negative review I've bothered to write on the net, several positive. Very expensive Ponderosa, if I could give it negative stars I would.",0
"Stayed here for the last night of our trip to Vegas and decided to spring for something a little \""extra\"" nice to go all out.\n\nThe clerk who checked us in was SO nice and the lobby looks and SMELLS so nice (which when most casinos smell like cigarettes, it was nice to enter something fresh).  It was also nice to have all the \""How Can I Help You?\"" people in the lobby.\n\nWe were upgraded to a 1 bedroom with strip views, which was awesome.  The room was a little disheveled; but I'll take it considering it was an upgrade.  The bathrooms were SUPER nice and the beds were really comfy.  \n\nWe spent the afternoon by the pool (not too crowded, though I wish there was an adults only section without a cover).  The drinks were standard, but yummy.  Good deal on $5 chips with 3 kinds of dips.\n\nWe ate at Border Grille; which was AWESOME. \n\nMy only complain was that around 1 everything was shut down. I wanted some fro-yo, or a drink at Mix, but was sad that all that was left open was EyeCandy, which I thought had bartenders with bad attitudes.\n\nAll in all, can't complain about the actual facilities.  Would love to make this a regualr stay for my Vegas vacays.",3
"Amy's Cafe is an excellent spot for lunch.  In college I lived across the street and had to stop there every other day.  Soup, salad and baguette is my favorite.  Their greek salads are excellent, the brocolli cheese soup very good, and who doesn't love baguettes.  Try the soup in a bread bowl as well.  Perfect spot for a light lunch.  Biggest drawback however, is the unbalanced tables outside and the size inside.  It's very compact, and if you're not careful when sitting outside you could lose your drink to the shaky tables that lean down the slight hill.",3
The fountain show is really entertaining.  The music they pump out is clear and loud.  The water shoots higher than you think it would be able to and it's just all around a good time depending on whether you  like the song playing or not.,4
"I went to cajun queen with some friends from work a while back. I had the Diane, which people seem to be raving about on yelp. It was okay. I found the favors to be very mild and uninteresting; there was no spicier or complexity to the meal. The live music was nice but makes me wonder if this place would be appropriate for a quiet, romantic dinner. I will probably give cajun queen another try just in case it was an off night.",2
"Nuts!  Some one beat me to writing the first review! Oh well....\n\nBut like Ruth C, I too, tried this spa out for the Spa Week Special. \nCannot beat a $50 massage to begin with, let alone at a spa like this  that is well appointed, spacious and new (opened in January 2010). Plus I was staying at the Embassy across the way so it was convenient.  \n\nWhen you first walk in, you go into the coed Roman Bath, it's nice warm (not hot) pool with day beds along the sides. Then you go into the separate men/women facilities. The woman's facility has a very spacious and lounge sitting area with a large screen TV, comfy huge leather arm chairs and couches. It reminded me a study or library room with its heavy dark wood walls, leather chairs and wood tables. I was thinking the only thing missing would be a fire place!  They offer complimentary fruits, granola, teas, coffe and water spiked with lemons. \n\nThe bathrooms come fully stocked with curling irons, hair dryers, hairspray, mouse, gel, deodarant, razors, shave get and brushes/combs. There vanity area is pretty large and spread out so you don't feel like you're in somebody elses space. The woman's area also has it's own whirlpool, steam room and sauna. \n\nThere's cold towels in ice and cold water all over the facility, in the co-ed and woman's area. The co-ed lounge area has a large flat screen on ESPN (gotta cater to the guys peppered in there with all the ladies!). and has the complimentary fruits, granola teas, etc, etc in there as well. \n\nI got this sugar cane/bamboo stick massage. My technician was professional, didn't talk too much but was friendly enough to make me feel comfortable. Rooms and ambiance are nice and warm, not huge, just enough for the table and your technician to move around.\nOver all, I liked this spa, I like it better than the Venetian's Spa and I'm come back.\n\nPros:\n-Size of the spa and facility. It's enough to move around in and feel comfortable. I went on a Saturday at noon so I'm thinking this would be as busy as it would get as there was lots of groups but still didn't feel too crowded. \n-The amenities and products provided.\n-Clean and new\n-Friendly and professional staff\n-The ambiance of different spaces are relaxing and inviting, although not all of the same color scheme or theme.\n\nCons:\n-It is the Hard Rock Hotel and it could get busy and crowded with large groups (think bachelorette parties, college co-ed) so you might want to consider when in the week you book your appt. \n-The hallway connecting the steam/sauna area to the showers/bathroom in the woman's facility is narrow! Only 1 woman can fit in it at time, 2 have to turn sideways to pass. Weird why they designed it like that.",3
My coworker and I got to this place all the time for lunch. They make our food super fast and our food is always delicious,4
"I love the concept of this place, but the execution always seem to leave much to be desired. Yes, the burgers on pretzel buns are good, but the rest of the menu never seems to be that impressive. Also, the service always just seems to be just, meh. Sure, they'll take your order but then they often seem to disappear for most of your meal and getting refills or even your check can be an adventure.\n\nWith so many other good places in the area I don't know how The Lodge survives.",1
"Server was upbeat, friendly and knew her stuff. She made several recommendations since we told her it was our first time there. The food came out quickly and looked good. We ordered ribs with beans and salad. The salad was in a small cup and was just iceberg lettuce with a little cheese. Not great, but ok. The dressing was ok too. The ribs were VERY tough and stringy and COLD. Also, they were nearly impossible to cut apart with the plastic knife (all \""silverware\"" is plastic here). I had to saw away at them and finally gave up. So whoever said the ribs were \""fall off the bone,\"" didn't get what we had. The beans were good and the buttered toast was pretty good, too. I will give the place another try to try the BBQ, but I'm not ordering the ribs! That's too bad for a place called Rib Shack.",2
"Had the suicide breakfast  here today with 7 other people and it was awesome!  The food was great and the service was really good, too. The owner/chef makes the 13 layer breakfast and then delivers it to the table personally. They advertise as feeding four people but 7 of us could barely finish it!! We saw the restaurant on the food network & knew we wanted to try on a visit ti Phoenix area - it was totally worth the trip!!",4
"I've been ordering here for years. Always had good experiences, except for tonight. The manager was extremely rude about me receiving cold pizza.  She definitely needs more training and needs to be kept off the phone!",1
"Loved the complimentary green chile tamale appetizer here!  I also adored the chicken enchilada with green chile cream sauce!!  I especially appreciated the fact that I was able to order this dish NOT fried.  Some venues refuse to alter their menu selections.  Understandable, since many chains strive to stay within national standards, but it's great to find establishments that gladly cater to their customers' wishes!\n\nEven though our first, and only, visit was 3 or 4 years ago, I vividly recall it was a beautiful night, so Mom and I opted to dine in the patio.  It started to get chilly, but we did not want to move inside for the solo acoustic guitarist was delightful playing his Santana covers.  Thank goodness I always keep an extra jacket/sweater in the car for emergencies!\n\nThank you Jalapeno for a memorable night!",3
"Came here the other day for my friends bday and had an absolute blast.\nWe stayed at the Encore that night, so going upstairs to get a few things then coming back to the club was really convenient. \nTo be completely honest, I wasnt completely blown away from XS the way everyone else seemed to be, but it was realllly nice. \nDrink prices in vegas are out of this world, so its best to find a guy and have him buy you drinks ;)\nI really liked the set up of XS. You have your traditional dance floor with tables around it, then you have the outside lounging area by the pool for when you get too tired to dance. \nOverall, really fun experience.",3
"My friend always wanted to try this Two Hippies. It was horrible. We did not get what we ordered, not sure what it was but we know what it wasn't. We ordered the special tea and when the guy brought it to us he said \"" we ran out\"", it was more expensive that the regular tea and we were not offered any kind of refund. Waste of time and money.",0
"I've made several visits to the Chicago Hamburger Co, I was initially introduced by a friend who knew that I was originally from Illinois and missed some good old fashioned Midwest comfort food. My first venture there I tried their Italian beef sandwich, which really hit the spot. I got it with mozzarella and a side of red sauce, not exactly traditional but sometimes I just get that craving. It was pretty good on this occasion, the beef itself was kinda average but the bread was PERFECTION and I was pleased. Round two, not so much...it didn't stack up to the initial experience I had. My quest for the classic Italian beef in Arizona will continue elsewhere... Due to the failed Italian beef situation,  on my next visit I got a burger. Good, but nothing amazing. Visit number four found me giving the double cheese sliders a try, and I think I found my mainstay for this joint. While the regular double burger was a bit much and left me feeling like a fat bastard for the next 6 hours, two of these delicious little double cheese sliders did the trick perfectly. The fries are usually on point, I dump a healthy dose of Cajun seasoning on them as a rule. All in all, a pretty cool joint that reminds me why Chicago will always be \""home\""...",3
"24 hour All-You-Can-Eat Buffet passes for 34, please? \n\nYeah, our family rolls deep. REAL DEEP. We, cheap Vietnamese families, decided to do the deal where you can go to any of the participating 7 buffets for $39.95 for 24 hours. Didn't really work out for me because after all the drinking and clubbing, all I wanted was a bowl of pho. And I hate waiting in line.\n\nWe got there around 6 pm and waited over 2 hours in line. Ughh. I think by the time I got in, I didn't have the energy to eat. \n\nRio has a huge diverse range of food, so there's many things to choose from. The best part was probably the tri-tip. I also loved the lemon salmon fillet. Everything else tastes like mediocre buffet food.\n\nDesserts were decent. I literally took one bite of almost everything they had there. I would say the things worth eating would be the cream puffs and fruit tart. Their gelato was no comparison to the Wynn's though.",2
"Absolutely the best meal we had in Las Vegas.  The food was flavorful, and the service was impeccable.  If you are in Vegas, making the trip through the maze in Caesars Palace to find Mesa Grill is 100% worth it.\n\nMy husband had the coffee encrusted filet mignon with a side of spiced sweet potatoes.  He swears it was probably the best steak he has ever had! (This from Mr. \""Always orders the steak\""). I wasn't as hungry, so I opted for an appetizer.  I thoroughly enjoyed the tiger prawns, roasted garlic tamale, and cilantro sauce.\n\nThe food was amazing at the tables on either side of us as well - we could hear them exclaiming about it!  \n\nAs good as the food was - the service managed to equal it.  I've never had my water refilled so often, the waitress be so knowledgable (we had wine questions), or the bus boys be so efficient.  Amazing, and all without ever feeling like someone was hovering over our table.\n\nGo to the Mesa Grill.  Even if Bobby Flay didn't personally cook our meal, the people there on a daily basis are infinitely qualified!",4
"I was so excited to try this pizza by my house, but I think I'll be ordering from Pizza Hut next time. I called and ordered the $7.99 one-topping special. When I went to get it, the lady who rang me up never, and I mean never, made eye-contact with me. She was short with me and everyone who called trying to place an order. After I paid, she went to the back to get my pizza and set it down at the farthest end of the counter instead of handing it to me..all while completely refusing to make eye contact. To make matters worse, the pizza looked like an oil field. There was a thick layer of grease over the pie. The strangest thing is that our pizza had like four pepperonis. They totally skimped on the topping. $7.99 is supposed to mean you get a deal, not crap. For what I got, I might as well order from Pizza Hut next time where at least I can expect consistency.",1
"Nice sports bar and great wait staff.  Food is very good.  The steak sandwich is a great cut of meat.  The grilled wings are also fantastic.  I especially like the fact they have free Wi-Fi.  \n\nWhat is disheartening is the smoke.  Like most of NC eating establishments the bar area is filled with smokers.  The air handles do a decent job, but your clothes still smell in the suitcase when you get home.  Also, the liquor is a bit pricey so if you can bribe the bartender you get a better deal.  \n\nThe wait staff is friendly and attentive.  But don't expect to eat on the cheap.  Choose carefully and you will do fine.  I will give it 4 stars when they make it smoke free.",2
"It's no sens saki. Everytime I'm here I miss sens more and more. Food is always amazing. Hence the 2 stars. Service here sucks. Just watched a bar tender drop a drink mix shake all over people at the bar! I've never seen that in 13 years if drinking. Ever. I miss sens. So much. Without the food, this place would be out of business. Sad. Signed, huge sens fan.",1
"This place really lived up to our expectations.  We love going to teppan grill style restaurants and we have a favorite one back home in California.  So on vacation in Vegas we decided to try this place out.  It was just as good as our place back home and priced about the same.  Our chef, hurricane pho, was awesome and fun.  Would definitely recommend the teppan grill to anyone looking for good affordable food in Vegas.",4
"I've been to this venue several times including the opening night of the newly renovated Joint for the Killers show last year. Ironically it this was either the first night or the last night of their tour. With the added bonus that the Killers are actually from Vegas, it made for a pretty wicked time. \n\nBut onto the venue itself...\n\nThis is one of those places that even though it's standing room/GA for (I think) most music shows, there really isn't a bad place to see. It's spacious enough to dance and move around without stepping on other people.\n\nThe bar line gets really busy and can take a long, long time to get drinks. Boo.\n\nI'm not a huge Hard Rock casino fan though and in my opinion that's The Joint's only real downfall. A wee bit of douche factor going on.  You know, those kind of people who desperately want to be seen... The lineup to get in to the Joint is crazy and there isn't much room to move. This place gets hella-busy after a show and it takes forever to get a cab (the taxi line is insane!) so prepare for a long wait. The casino floor is small and cramped compared to the other Vegas casinos so hanging out after a show is kinda hard if rubbing up against skeezy looking club chicks/wannabe porn actresses isn't exactly your thing.\n\nOverall though, The Joint is a great venue and I never hesitate to buy tickets for shows here. Especially when you really, really like the bands. Though the venue can house a lot of people, it still has a somewhat intimate vibe to see your favorite bands all up close and personal.",3
...and this chit-hole is still open??  WHY???  Must be so the gang-bangers have a place to conduct target practice.,0
"This store has the coolest collection of retro treasures I have ever seen. I was in today to buy a Christmas gift for my mom and I had a hard time deciding what to get her because they have so many cool items. If I was refurnishing my apartment, I would go here to look for inspiration. I love this place and I wish I could just live in the store.",4
3.5 stars. Its good and consistent. Its not my favorite sushi place but my wife and daughter enjoy it and its conveniently located for us.,2
"If I could give zero I would . We purchased an air conditioning unit for our shop and came to pick it up in the store. Well the \""customer service\"" desk employee, Nestor  wasn't about his job title. He was very rude and quick to cut me off. We paid good money for merchandise in their store. You think they'd at least have some class and speak to us with some respect. I think I'll avoid picking anything from here again.",0
"To start of the new year, we were in Phoenix. My cousin recommended this place and he was able to make reservations via Open Table for the 6 of us. Our reservations were for 7pm, but they were that packed that we didn't get seated until around 7:30. It's a cozy lil place and when we finally did get seated we sat in the \""governor's corner.\""\n\nThey had a lot of drink specials which I would have loved to try, but I was feeling under the weather. I ended up ordering the Cedar Planked Salmon. I made my husband get the special for the night,  ribeye surf and turf (basically shrimp, sausage and scallops on a stick as the surf part). My salmon was a slightly over cooked and I wasn't a fan of the horseradish potatoes, but I ended up trading the potatoes with my husband's potatoes which were so much better. =) He seemed like he enjoyed his meal and he ended up eating the rest of mine too. (That's what husband's are good for ;)) In any case, I loved the atmosphere and the company. We ended up getting two free desserts with the kitchen being backed up and the wait for the table. We ended up with the croissant bread pudding and the warm chocolate torte. Both were delicious, but the warm chocolate torte was my favorite. \n\nOverall, service was good especially for a busy night and food was decent. I would definitely want to come back to try some drink specials and more desserts. =)",3
I ordered the double cheeseburger.    It was pretty tasty.    What makes this only a 3 star review was the service.   We were visiting from California and it probably doesn't surprise anyone that we don't speak French.   The server insisted on speaking to us in French and we could barely understand a word.    Her body language spoke volumes though.   She was obviously didn't want to attempt to communicate with us in any way.   She maintained a gruff look on her face and an offensive posture.   No help at all.,2
"Love this place. The view, atmosphere, service and food were phenomenal. Prefix menu came with lots of compliments from the chef as well. On point, probably one of the best restaurants in vegas... and the bathrooms in the back are a definite bonus.",4
"We have brought our vehicle to this location just a few times.  A simple oil change did go well despite the long wait. They quote you a time of 45 min-1hr and you end up being there for 2hours atleast even with an appointment.  If you have a repair done here dont bother trying to follow up for the same issue. We had to replace our alternator recently and ever since we have experienced very poor customer service from the front desk. They give you the run-around about your repair questions or concerns.They are rude to say the least.  The staff seems to never hear any of the noises under the hood that the we, the carowner,  hear. You ask to go on the test drive with the employee and they deny you the opportunity. Or they say the mechanic is at lunch right now. It seem they take lunch break all day. Overall i will not bring either of my two cars to this shop again nor will i refer to any of my friends.",0
"Tandoori Times turned out to be an impromptu Valentine's dinner for my husband and I.  We just usually don't do dinner out on V-Day.  Not that we have anything against the big day, but my idea of a romantic dinner out does not involve 50 other couples having their special dinner at the same time.  Anywho, fondue was the plan, but I neglected to buy anything to dip into the imaginary cheese I also failed to buy.\n\nWe settled on Tandoori as neither of us had been there, just down the street from home, and we didn't expect it to be a major Valentine's destination.  I was pleasantly surprised they were offering a complimentary rose for the ladies.  Complimentary, as in free.  No dude peddling his roses to unsuspecting men who may have previously neglected the flower ritual and know they are damned if they do (like a $5 rose is going to make up for screwing up the flower thing) and damned if they don't (he's so cheap, he couldn't even buy me a stinkin' $5 rose).  Nice touch, no pressure, woman happy, all is well.\n\nWe started with the bread basket which had to be a concoction of Robert Atkins' evil twin.  It had four kinds of Naan (plain, onion, garlic, and potato).  We ate all we could and then some and still had leftovers.  I had the chicken makhani which is a tomato based curry with herbs and spices.    Perhaps a little too spicy if you can't tolerate any heat, but for me it was perfect.  My husband had the lamb vindaloo.  I tried it and it was a little too hot for me, but it was pretty damn good I must say.\n\nWe found our server to be pleasant and attentive.  I'm sorry we didn't go sooner (actually we tried, but they close between lunch and dinner) as they are moving their Scottsdale location to Hayden & Via de Ventura.  Somehow I think we'll make the extra effort to go again.  But I will attempt to avoid the belly dancing-I've got more than enough belly of my own.",3
The sin city burger was AWESOME! And the chili cheese fries tasted way better than they looked. Decent prices & nice atmosphere. I definitely recommend this place!,4
"The food is good, but after we got our food, the waiter and a kitchen worker went outside to smoke a cigarette and left the door open.  The entire restaurant filled with gross smoke. Unpleasant experience and won't be back. We will call in for pick up next time.",1
"Am I ordering wrong? Been here a few times just to make sure, but all visits left me craving real Mexican food even more. Roberto's didn't do it for me :-( Tried several items on different occasions and all were pretty boring - nothing special.\n\nTried: Chicken enchiladas,  chicken tacquitos, chicken quesadilla, crunchy chicken and beef tacos, rice & beans etc.\n\nI've never had their burritos,  so maybe that is the ticket??",1
"Pretty good burger but nothing special.  It was overpriced in my opinion and bit over hyped.\nService was.......rushed?  We felt like they where pushing people out, and the waitress was rude.  Would not go back.",2
"I went with my mom and little sister to go dress hunting and we walked in to a VERY QUIET shop.  Three ladies working greeted us looking a little confused and when I gave my name and information had me fill out a form.  A younger girl took me back to the dress area and told me to select whatever I wanted to try on and showed me to the dressing room.  There was no one in the shop.  I asked my sister to play her Pandora because it was awkwardly quiet.  The young girl placed a dress in my room and told me to call her in if I needed help.  I asked if they had any bras and they did NOT which was sort of disappointing because everything I read on line told me that bridal boutiques usually have bras for you to use.  No biggie, just went on with my bra and tucked the straps in. The first four dresses I tried on just weren't doing anything for me and I wasn't finding anything I really think went with my personality.  Amber was not working with me but overheard me talking to my sis and mom about how the dresses I had chosen were all wrong.  Amber took over the appointment and found out a little about me and came back with a dress for me to try.  She put me in it and zipped me up.  The curtain opened up and my mom and sister instantly said, \""That's the dress. That is the best one.\""  I had been to another shop before we came to La Bella and I thought I had found \""the one\"" already. I looked in the mirror and replied in a whiny voice, \""It IS better. This IS the one\"" Amber took that extra minute to find out what I was looking for and I am SO freaking excited about my dress!!!! I will need to get it altered a tad smaller to my size once it arrives, but I'm OK with that. My dress is gorgeous and I am confident that my dress is exactly perfect for me and fits my personality.  SO thankful that Amber took over my appointment and put me in my wedding dress. ALSO- if you pay the full total same day, you get a discount!",3
Ordered the Italian sandwich and a coke 17 bucks! Sandwich was just A-okay but I was super hungry so oh well probably would not go back for real food but ice cream looked good.,1
The chicken caesar sandwich was very good! This is about as tasty as a gyros place can be.,3
"Yummy!! Ordered the asparagus from the grill, BBQ rice, spicy avocado roll and spicy prawn roll. Everything was fabulous. Unagi roll was ok. Wonderful atmosphere and great service.",3
My family and I eat at Bad Daddy's all the time. It is one of our favorite local neighborhood restaurants. The Bad Daddy's service is 5 stars.  One time I was stealing bacon from my Dad's burger. The waiter caught me and brought me bacon of my own. The food is 4 stars. My favorite is the kid sliders and my Dad likes the Frenchie.  The sweet potato fries are awesome.  The ambience is 4 stars. They even let me bring my dog on the patio.,3
"We LOVE this place & go every time we are in the area. It's artsy eclectic style has cafe style tables as well as a sofa and chair seating area. Different art decorates the walls. The exterior is very blah, but don't let it fool you. Once inside you will find a really hip & trendy place. Great friendly service with amazing food. The green hummus rocks as do their Soynami's! The Green burger is phenomenal too! It's always busy, but well worth the wait. We have never had anything there that wasn't good. Very affordable too. My kids & I are vegetarian while my husband is vegan and this place satisfys us all. This place is a quality vegetarian place & they like to be eco-friendly & green... added bonus as far as I am concerned. Can't wait to fly back to the Phoenix area to stop in this awesome gem of a place!",4
"Stopped in with my family for breakfast on our quick 2 day stay in Edinburgh before heading to the Highlands and days later we're all still raving about this gem. The breakfast was amazing--toast, eggs and bacon, all local--topped off with a serious good cup of coffee. The server was so sweet and friendly, he really made our visit that much better. I can't say enough about this small, cozy, perfect nook of a place in the heart of The Royal Mile. I will return!",4
"I'm a little on the meh side for the Shoppes at the Palazzo because it's not a very inviting environment for shopping. It is true that some of the very high end, very up-scale stores reside here and without a lot of money its hard for you to enjoy this place. But wait!\n\nThe Forum Shops have JUST as many or similar types of designer stores ... why is it more fun?\n\nWell in the end, I attribute it to the fact that the Forum Shops have some \""regular stores\"" as to draw a crowd and shows which retain the crowd. You don't want to shop in an empty mall where you're the only person browsing the store (unless you REALLY don't care). I feel like a great shopping experience and the whole point of shopping in a store is for the interaction, direct or indirect, that you have with everyone else. When I walk into the Palazzo, it's so empty it makes me want to be somewhere else with more people despite the awesome designer stores.\n\nThis is not to say I will boycott the Shoppes, but it's definitely not my popular choice.",2
"I love this place because it is healthy, quick, and the staff is very friendly and welcoming. There is a register to pick up phone in orders and a takeout order usually is ready within 15 minutes. It is one of the healthiest places around and sure does beat fast food. The menu options are really great too.",4
"I enjoyed my first visit to Distrito for lunch with my team the other day. Their lunch menu was easy to order off of, and priced pretty well. Although the portions seemed a taaaad small, my nachos were very tasty (and unique) and my carnitas tacos were fresh and left me wanting another. They were up there with some of the best tacos I've had. The place has a pretty cool vibe and I wanted to check it out more but didn't have time. We sat in their pretty good size outdoor patio, and our server was constantly checking in on us. To sum it up, I want to go back.",4
I would actually love to give this place no stars but obviously I can't. I stayed at this hotel one time and that's all that did it for me. This hotel is randomly stupid. The slots are like whatever too. I stayed there for 3 nights. The first night I barely was in the room. The second night is where everything went down. I slept in the bed and woke up covered in blotches all over my body. They itched like crazy and I was finding myself looking for a CVS and trying to get rid of it rather than sitting by the pool having a good time. I later found out the hotel has a bed bug problem. My suitcase was on the bed half the time so I just threw the whole thing out including my clothes. I rushed to a doctor out here by my house and they said they go away on their own. I spent almost a month being tormented by it.,0
"As good as it gets. Fast, courteous, helpful, super friendly, extremely knowledgeable, and above all honest. I have no doubts that Michael can address any concerns you might have as well as help guide you along the way. A true professional. It sounds corny but this guy is a complete package that I didn't even know a notary could be!\n\nApparently he has other notaries that work with him in order to provide 24 hr service and accommodate customers in a timely fashion no matter where they are located or if they have special needs. I suppose this means your experience might be different, but I'd be very surprised if anyone associated with this operation served you wrong. I mean the guy will refer potential customers to chain stores if he feels that their needs (time / cost) would be better met ... what a guy!\n\nTrust me when I say this is the place to call if you have any notary needs. It's been a long time since I've felt so cared for as a customer! \nDo not hesitate, call now :-)",4
"Reserved wraparound balcony suite overlooking the Bellagio fountains for a 40th  B'day bash and was told check in was at 3pm. Tried to check in at 3:30 and was told room was not ready. By 4:30 was told their \""official policy\"" is that check in is from 3-5pm. Come 5:30, still no room. I, and many other angry customers, was ushered into the concierge check in area, presumably so as not to disrupt other customers (one poor couple was scheduled to get married and the bride-to-be had no place to get dressed).\nBy 6pm we still had no room. I had a car load of food and beverages and friends arriving.  I spoke with the check in manager. After a brief exchange of unpleasantries she finally offered that the reason they were so far behind was they had 80 housekeeping personnel call in that day. \""So you can't manage your own personnel, but you expect me to be confident that you can meet my needs as a guest?\"" I asked.\nBy 6:30 we were finally in a room. It was a wraparound suite, but not overlooking the fountains. Whatever, the whole mood was ruined by then anyway. Oh yeah, and I'm Marriott Gold, but apparently that doesn't matter either. \nBtw, my first clues that this establishment was far from a class act should have been:\n1) the punk who dropped his beer bottle down the side of the escalator, nearly hitting a girl in the lounge below (the smirk on his face led me to think it was not an accident), and\n2) the drunk girl sitting on a bench outside the elevators and throwing up all over herself and the lobby floor. \n\nLooking for a class joint?  Go to the Palazzo. We just staycayed there and it was great. \n\nBeware the Cosmopolitan of Las Vegas!",0
"Typical 50'5 style diner fare.\n\nThe food is good, the wait staff is always friendly.\n\nKids menu items are only $.99, excluding drinks.  So if you really want to save some dough, tell your kids to just order water.\n\nIt's worth a try.",2
"The first BBQ I had when we got to Charlotte two years ago, and it's still my favorite spot in town for a couple of reasons. So, Mac's Speed Shop gets my first review (and it goes for this location and the other I've visited on Sandy Porter Road in the Steele Creek area).\n\nFirst, the place knows what it is and does everything possible to make sure you enjoy yourself. Servers are attentive & knowledgable, service is fast, but you're also welcome to take your time and enjoy the extensive beer list for as long as you'd like.\n\nSecond, the food's consistently top notch. It isn't the truest NC BBQ you'll find, so a hard-core traditionalist may not rave about it, but they have the right mix of variety and restraint that gives everyone in your party an option that's going to be GOOD. Other \""wing\"" places need to recognize that these grilled & smokey wings are the best in town. Hungry for a steak? Try the KC Beef Rib instead. You'll feel like Fred Flintstone when it's put in front of you and like the luckiest yelper on earth when you're finished. \n\nAnd if you're there with five or six friends, please (PLEASE) take on the Fatboy Challenge together. For less than $50 you'll all get to try the best sandwich in Charlotte without the nasty side effects of trying to eat 5+ pounds of food by yourself. It's sweet, smokey, and surprisingly spicy on a great loaf of Ciabatta. Plus you get a big ol' bowl of Mac N Cheese and a pitcher of beer included on the tab.\n\nThird, that beer list. Mac's gets a little bit of everything and has the prettiest lineup of taps I've seen in this town. They have some cheaper domestic tall boys if that's your thing, but please do yourself the favor of asking the well-versed bartenders for a taste of something new or a recommendation based on your usual drink. You'll be better for it.\n\nFinally, as a Steelers fan, I love having this caliber of place to go on game days. Any football fan should have Mac's on their list of destinations for Monday Nights, too... a good chunk (if not all) of their drafts are always 1/2 off on Monday. Best deal in town.",4
Customer service is so so but what do you expect when your establishment is in the New York New York casino and you cater to a-holes all day. Food is a great value. Large selection of sweet and breakfast style crepes for under $10. Good value,2
"You know you love it really...\n\nPicture the scene - navy jumper, purple triangles....yeah,you're in Pringle.\n\nIt's got a bit of a cult following, does our Pringle. A lot of my friends when I was in 1st year came here for their pub-golf crawls...they come once and realise that they can't afford to come again, thus use the same outfits over and over. Nothing wrong with that!\n\nThe price is hefty, not extreme, but hefty. Good quality though!!",3
After going back a second time I was not as impressed with the service. After noticing the menu said the potatoes may contain traces of bacon fat my friend asked the waitress what this meant. The waitress said the potatoes contained small bits of bacon fat. I told the waitress Ive had the potatoes and I am a vegetarian and the menu should state it does contain bacon. She looked confused and didn't seem to care. After that we noticed our waitress tended to her other customers cheerfully and hardly said two words to us. Definitely disappointed.,2
"Unpalatable. \n\nI am a spicy food connoisseur. I like it extra hot  to eye-watering. However:\n\nMy throat and stomach are extremely sore right now from the \""spicy\"" dishes at this place. Dear Thai Elephant Sadists: When you are running a restaurant, you need to know that when a customer requests a dish made \""spicy,\"" which is on your menu and not a special request, this is not an invitation to a staff joke where you dump two tablespoons of crushed red pepper directly into a single order. I would like to think that the dish is cooked with the heat in it to enhance flavor, not just to show off to the non-Asian folk who DARE to have the NERVE to ask for it spicy. \""I'll show YOU what spicy means, DUBYA.\"" Because I happen to be Asian, grew up on kimchee, and I can take it. Until today - this is just plain ridiculous. Who the FUCK would EVER eat it like this?? PLEASE see the photo I uploaded of this piece of broccoli with nothing but PURE CRUSHED CHILIS STUCK IN ITS BRANCHES.\n\nIf it's going to be super, ass-flaming spicy when you order it, they should tell you it's over-the-top and not intended for you to actually taste your food. I have been guzzling water and rinsing my mouth and it's going to be a few hours before I can even find something else to eat while my tastebuds and lips recover.",0
"This place is HORRIBLE!!!! Do NOT take your pets here!! We had an awful experience. The owner is a rude egotistical jerk who cares more about getting your money then your pet. \n\nWe took our yorkie in after calling and asking if they had time. We called @ 10am. They said no problem. So we took her and got there @ 10:30. The woman at the front desk told us it would only be a couple hours, and they would call us when she was ready. I called after 2 hours and they said she wouldn't be done until 4:30pm. We would have picked her up and taken her somewhere else, but they were already giving her a bath. When they finally called it was 5:00 the time they closed. We wouldn't have gotten her in time. They offered boarding her for the night for a small fee, and we could pick her up in the morning.\n\nWe arrived right when they were supposed to open @ 9am. We banged on the door for an hour, and could hear our dog barking along with other dogs that were there. We called multiple times and got the answering machine. At one point we even called the police, but they couldn't do anything. After another hour of banging the owner finally came to the door. He looked like he had been sleeping or hungover. My husband asked why they weren't open, when the sign on the door says they opened at 9 on Sundays. He grumbled saying they aren't open on Sundays. He went back to get our dog, and threw her over the counter at me. When I asked about her collar and leash, he went into the back to get them. When he returned, he demanded we pay and held on to the collar and leash. We told him we weren't going to pay due to the horrible service. He argued with us for a few minutes before he handed my husband the collar and leash. \n\nBesides the horrible customer service, the cut they gave our dog was terrible. I asked for a specific cut, and even brought in a picture. She looked nothing like the picture. She was shaved short, and her cut they gave her face was all choppy and looked as though my six year old gave her a haircut. \n\nI will NEVER return to this place. I HIGHLY recommend you STAY AWAY!!",0
"zero stars! I had no hot water, room are plain, hallways are dirty just an overall bad hotel. Not to mention i tried calling front desk and there was no answer the 3 times i tried! I then used my cell phone to call and was finally able to get a hold of them. Only thing i liked about this place was that O'sheas was connected to it. The Quad sucks.",0
"We had $75 in gift cards for numerous restaurants on the strip.  We happened to be in the Paris hotel and were hungry and looked at the lunch menu, which looked appealling.  We decied to try it.  We ordered a beer and the french onion soup, which was outstanding!  The outstanding part stopped there!  We had to flag down our waiter for another drink and refills on water.  We waited at least 45 minutes for our meal, which we ordered sauteed mushrooms, which came cold, a beef dip and strip steak with bernaise.  The whole meal was cold and the steak was tough.  Our server never checked on us and our LUNCH meal was $90!!!  Luckily we had a $75 voucher!  \nPricey, terrible service and bad food!",0
"Absolutely horrible experience after MANY positive experiences.  I am not sure if they changed ownership, but I could have arguably just had the worst pedicure/manicure of my life.  If you are going to do a bad job because you do not have a lot skill, that is one thing, but my tech could have cared less about doing a good job.  LAZY, expensive and we waited almost 30 minutes just to get in.  This will be my last time here.",0
"Addendum to my earlier review - I did say that I would be able to give a more meaningful review on my second visit when I am actually sober. \n\nI would like to retract that.

"Remember when East Towne mall was nothing?  A big building full of emptiness, speckled with a few pathetic stores here and there?  Ten to 15 years later, and now its been completely revamped and is all dolled up with white twinkly lights, and cheesy holiday decorations.  Hell, even Santa shows up there now.  \n\nBut guess what?  You can't just walk around the mall without some dipstick wanting you to try on their lotion or straighten your hair for you!!!  Isn't that exciting?  It's like being harassed by a car salesperson, only these people want to let you know how ugly you are, and how they can improve you with their shit products.  \n\nDo you want to try this wonderful lotion?  Can I straighten your hair for you?  Can I ask you a question about your skin??!  Can I ruin this trip to the mall for you by refusing to leave you alone every time you walk by?!?!  \n\nYES!!!!  It's like getting a root canal and then asking for a do over.  Because, even if you politely say no thank you, they persist, and harass, and then as you are walking away, you hear them say snide little things about you.    \n\nI hate those pushy bastards.  They ruin every, single trip to the mall.",0
"I was on my way to another restaurant, but after only a few moments inside, we decided we might be better served by trying Sens.  The restaurant is very cozy, with space for maybe 50 diners.  Our table wobbled, something we solved by shoving extra chopsticks under the base.  It's the hazard of a concrete floor I suppose.  While the decor seemed very relaxing and almost spa-like, the music felt incongruent.  It wasn't exactly Top 40s, but it was a bit more upbeat and I think some of the more calm music out of Asia might have been more appropriate.  \n\nWe were seated relatively quickly (too many cushions on that couch!) and were asked for our drink order.  My dinner companion just wanted water, but I typically take hot green tea when I'm in an asian establishment.  The waitress seemed confused by my request and said \""We have two kinds, Oolong and Jasmine\"".  I asked for Jasmine and she walked off to go get it.  What she brought back was...interesting.  It had nothing to do with green tea, or any actual tea that I know of.  There was just a single blossom of what I can only assume is jasmine, sitting in the hot water.  Very pretty, but I was less than impressed with parts of it started clogging the spout, making it difficult to pour.  The tea was delicious, but it was a floral tea.  I was hoping for actual tea.  Jasmine can be used as an additional component of green tea, but this was just a blossom of Jasmine.\n\nWe ordered the cold duck, beef carpaccio, mango and papaya salad with shrimp, napa wraps, and pork gyoza.\n\nThe duck was very good.  The Five Spice sauce was well-balanced.  The duck was good, if a little overcooked, which a night in the fridge only made the texture more like cold liver.  Still, I did enjoy it.\n\nNext up was the beef carpaccio; doused with lime juice and mint chiffonade, served on prawn crackers.  The crackers were a bit too delicate for their cargo, but my real complaint was the dish.  All I could taste was mint with lime.  I really had to fight to identify the beef.\n\nThen we had the salad.  I was hoping for a pleasantly sweet and mildly savory dish.  What we got looked very nice on the plate, but both me and my companion simply could not deal with the abundance of pickled ginger.  It was so powerful, I couldn't taste anything else.  I couldn't even find anything that looked like fruit.  There were long strings of what might have been papaya, if it had been allowed to ripen.  Under the ginger fire, all I could really identify was that it could have been carrot.  Four shrimp were served along side; the most perfectly cooked shrimp I have had in quite some time.  \n\nThe napa wraps were simple enough; mushrooms and more of that perfect shrimp rolled up in a cabbage leaf and steamed.  We were unable to determine the best way to eat them, as they were bigger than an amuse bouche, but with only chopsticks, we had to deal and open wide.  The mechanics of eating were tricky, but the dish itself gave us more shrimp and I had no complaints.\n\nThe final course they brought was the pork gyoza.  I've had enough of these to expect a loose-pack pork and ginger sausage with a steamed or fried (sometimes both) wonton wrap.  These were the steamed kind, but the treasure they held inside was phenomenal.  I wanted more, but we had to leave.\n\nThis was my first asian tapas experience. Perhaps some of my criticism comes from my french culinary upbringing.  I will definitely be going here again, if only for more shrimp and gyoza.  Probably when my lips stop burning from the pickled ginger.",2
Nothing to write home about but will do for an average meal.  Salsa was good.  Meal was average and service uninspired. At least we beat the dinner rush so there wasn't a wait.,2
"After the semi-drama my friends and I ran into at Tryst, we all head back to Luxor (where we were staying) to grab some late night grub. The cheeseburger here is a MUST try. I don't know what kind of bun they use for it, but it's so good. The fries are awesome too. The only thing I regret is not being able to finish my order.",3
"I came to the Golden Corral with my family on a Thursday night to beat the out-the-door line. We still had about a 15 minute wait until we finally reached our table.\n\nThe Golden Corral offers tasty food for a very generous price. It's about $15 for all-you-can-eat dinner and a drink. For my drink, I got the sweet tea, which I thought was delicious.\n\nI was really impressed with the quality of the food. For the price we paid, mostly everything tasted great! The fried chicken was really juicy, as was the steak (mine was ordered medium well). Everyone wants steak though, so be prepared to wait in line for it. They had a lot of variations of chicken, (fried, rotisserie, BBQ, teriyaki) but I only tried the fried chicken, which was crispy and fully of flavor. The BBQ pulled pork was pretty good, too. I also liked the mashed potatoes and gravy. For dessert, of course I got the cotton candy! So good and a very generous serving. \n\nAs for my dislikes, I didn't care too much for the Mac n cheese; it was undercooked. The corn was seasoned well, but slightly overcooked; it was rather mushy already. I tried the pot roast, and it was still really dry despite it being doused in gravy. The southern fried fish was much too salty. \n\nMy biggest complaint would be with the lack of cleanliness of the facility. Our waitress was very nice and attentive, but her apron was really gross. Something was smeared across the front of it and it was crusted on there and looked extremely unappetizing. Normally I would be embarrassed to comment on that, but it really was not the greatest start to my meal to see that. Also there is a lot of trash and crumbs scattered all over the floor. I want to be understanding of them because the place is always reeeeally crowded, but it was simply unacceptable for my taste. It honestly made me feel a bit uncomfortable.  \n\nOverall, I had an okay dining experience at the Golden Corral because the food exceeded my expectations but I'm not sure I'll be back very soon.",2
"We purchased a 2010 Yukon SLT from Desert Buick a year ago.  We have brought it to the service department for all oil changes and services.  Alan in the service department is AMAZING!!!! He remembers my name and treats me with the up most respect.  As most women know they usually do not get much respect when dealing with auto mechanics.  Alan always returns my calls immediately and gives various options in best way to deal with situation.  He makes you feel like family!!  I love going to him knowing my truck is in good HONEST hands.  I highly recommend any service needs you may have, this is the man to be beyond trusted.",4
"My fiance and I were looking for a new dentist after we moved from California to Nevada and I found this place. My first impression was good the girls at the front desk were very nice and helpful. It was all going well until I was brought back into the cleaning room. The doctor barely spoke to me which was fine because all I really wanted was my cleaning but then they sent in the hygienist. She was aweful. She was rude and unprofessional and literally had her breasts resting on top of my head for my entire cleaning. She was very rough and not at all concerned with the pain she was inflicting not to mention that every few minutes she would let out this ridiculous exasperated sigh like I had just ruined her day by being there. It was horrendous. A few days later my fiance had his appointment. Dr. Willis came in and proceeded to try to sell him numerous unnecessary services. They then refused to even do his cleaning until he scheduled for a \""deep cleaning\"" which was going to cost us about $200. Judging from the other reviews on here and google and my personal experience this doctor is only concerned with one thing, his wallet. It was absolutely appalling.",0
Awful buffet!  Food wasn't delicious and there wasn't a croissant in sight. Total bummer.,0
"These cupcakes were, in general, crazy delicious. My only complant was that the frosting was too much in quantity and in sweetness. My favorite part of a cupcake is frosting and I could have done with about half the amount of frosting they served. My boyfriend, who has a \""second stomach\"" for desserts even complained that the frosting was a bit much. But I guess that's the craze with cupcakes these days?\nWe sampled 4 different flavors: carrot cake, chocolate velvet, coconut macaroon, and some sort of strawberry flavor. The strawberry one was too sweet and not great, but the others were pretty amazing. The chocolate velvet one came with a molten chocolate-like center, surrounded by chocolate cake and decadent chocolate frosting. The carrot cake was moist, flavorful and came with an amazing cream cheese frosting. The coconut macaroon one came with a real, little baby coconut macaroon on top! That was my favorite part, but the cupcake was chocolate-y and the frosting was coconut-y and delicious.\nWould definitely eat these cupcakes again!",3
"OMG please do not stay here if you dont have too. My friends and i went to montreal for a Spanish festival and she booked the hotel. Being in the hotel industry in the past I have high expectations. This place was a huge dump. I was scared I was going to catch something for sure!! The bed was low to the ground, the place was dirty and the decore was so wrong on so many levels. There was a chandalere hanging in the center of the room so low you could hit it when you sat up on the bed. The celing was covered with droopy white sheets with brown huge stains. I was so happy we were only staying there for one night!! The room key was an actual key with a huge piece of wood attached to it. No so convient as it wouldnt fit into anyones pocket.. \n\nall in all a HUGE disastor and I do not recommend this nasty place to anyone!!",0
"This place is A-OK!  I was contemplating giving it 4 stars but the scene is getting a bit dated.  They need to spruce it up or something.  It's just sorta there now.  But don't get me wrong, every time I go here I enjoy myself - but I make sure I have a good group to go with.  You do see some regulars but that's just the type of place that it is.  I like that you get a mixed crowd, no one too young and most of the people that seem to frequent this joint are in there late 20's, 30's, and 40's.\n\nIt can get a bit pricey if you have a tab open and aren't thinking about what your drinking and how much the drinks are.  The drinks are made reasonably well, by that I mean they have enough alcohol in them so that you don't have to wonder why you just paid $10 for ice, water, and a splash of alcohol.  \n\nBack in the day Bossa Nova was a novel idea for this town, but now with all these upscale bars/lounges and restaurants opening they may have to reinvent themselves somehow.  \n\nAll in all a fun place to hang out.  One thing I noticed is that there is a gap between when it's jumping.  Right after work is good b/c you get the happy hour peeps, but then it seems to clear out after 7:30 PM and then it picks back up around 10:30 PM...maybe it was just the night that I went, but I have a feeling that this is the norm.",2
"I can't believe I'm barely writing this reviews!\n\nThis place goes down as one of those \""must visit again\"" spots.  I really enjoyed just about every aspect of our visit here a month or so ago.  \n\nIt's a small joint, well-staffed (we were very well tended to!), friendly, delicous menu, decently priced, and overall a memorable meal experience.\n\nHubby had the Breakfast Burrito (a crepe, actually) and though this man can eat, he couldn't even finish it.. Note however that I had a bite of it and wasn't jumping for joy like I was with mine: I had the Chicken Pesto crepe which was *outstanding*.. plenty of pesto and chicken and this delcious cheese crispyness on the edges of my crepe... my mouth was excited and anticipating the next bite!  We also split one of their sweet crepes to see how those tasted and we were not disappointed: the creme brulee crepe with fresh berries and candied fruit was impressive.. simple yet every bite was special and exciting in the mouth.\n\nI really liked their friendliness, LOVED their crepes and appreciated their business venture.. I love supporting local businesses, especially when they make awesome food you want more and more of.  I'll definitely be back!",3
"best priced, best tasting buffet in las vegas. there's a reason why the wait is over an hour long. \n\nprime rib is cooked to PERFECTION. even the well-done section is tasty and not tough or gamey or chewy. the buffet is REASONABLY priced and it has a REASONABLE selection. they dont take every food name they can think of, and put it in the buffet. you get a little bit of each type of food without being overwhelmed.\n\nthe desserts are delicious and theres gelato and fresh coffee drink options. service is GREAT in that sense. service was NOT great trying to get in. after you get through the line, you wait in another line. and i asked the lady how much longer we have to wait. she doesn't  tell me a time. she just tells me \""a few more minutes\"". woman... 20 minutes is not \""a few more minutes\"". this is my only complaint about this place. but i can't complain that the line was long and i was hungry. just comes to show how many people will go out of their way for good food. \n\nthe price is reasonable. and theres free beer and wine. i absolutely enjoyed their seafood/sushi that i expected to be gross after my experience at bellagio. meat. meatmeatmeatmeatmeat. gosh im hungry. prime rib. prime freaking rib. \n\nok. im just going to keep repeating myself so.... goodbye.",4
The food here is okay in comparison with another nearby sub place.  The meat is pre-sliced and comes from packages.  The bread is usually a bit on the stale side.,2
"Pastrami was good, bread was soggy. Cajun fries had a good seasoning. Fresh strawberry lemonade was probablly the best thing in the meal. This place isn't even close to Johnny's Pastrami in LA, which blows it out of the water.",1
"Solid 3.5 stars rounded up. \n\nA mood struck me, it was last minute.  I needed to get out to some place new.  So I sent a text to Anna M and we decided to meet in her neck of the woods.  A quick Yelp search put this place at the top of our list.  \n\nParking was packed.  I had to park in the lot next door.  There were several folks on the patio. As we walked in we were greeted by a large indoor bike rack.  Pretty neat!\nWe claimed 2 empty seats at the bar and the server let us know that they had Happy Hour all day during the weekend, the beers with the * were $1 off and sandwiches were $6.  Ohhh nice deal! \n\nAs we looked through the menu we also noticed they offer all you can eat 1-topping pizza for $7 on Sundays. We agreed we needed to come back on a Sunday to check this place out. \nOnce we realized they also do Pub Trivia nights we also agreed we needed to come back for that too.  In fact much of the crowd on this night was here for the Pub Trivia so much so that within an hour after it was over this place emptied by more than half. \n\nThe food and service were quality.  We decided to split the honey chicken sandwich with waffle fries.  A little cheese, bacon, lettuce, tomato, onion and pickle. The chicken breast was grilled and was thick and moist. \nThe 2 of us with 2 good beers each and sharing a sandwich came out to about $30 including tip.",3
"10yr vet of this joint.... sad to say, food quality is slipping.. ya commodities are getting up there, who out there except for the medicare crew and the midwest fannypackers wouldn't rather pay a few bucks more for quality vs a mediocre meal to hit a price point... Lady Frasher, I am breaking up with you... you were excellent, now you are good... still great service and great corcktailz, but... you are like the girlfriend that kissed another dude... ya I'll be back.... for corcktailz and apps before the gentlemen's  club official inspection service.  It is o.k. to charge for quality.",2
"This place is an absolute joke! I don't even know how this lady \""Nina\"" has a shop. Her work is very poor quality, she is rude and does nothing but blame the customer instead of fixing the issues and offering some kind of incentive. \n\nMy brothers wedding was on Saturday 26th of April 2014, he was told to go on Thursday after 2pm to pick everything up, when his party showed up items were missing one of the tuxes wasn't even there, which was a inconvenience since everyone has school or work. \n\nAfter everyone picked up their items and took them home, there were many flaws, from too small, to too big and she did nothing but complain to us that we waited too long to fix it.\n\nOn Saturday day of the wedding everyone finally received the items, but once again one of the vest was extremely small and we had to alter it our selves, the ring barer second pair of pants had no hook to close them and his white shirt was filthy.\n\nWe've tried to get our money back and all she does is blame the customer and refuses to help or refund money In anyway. Please whatever you do do not go here, save your time, money, and the agony this lady will put you through.",0
"This is my second time staying at Trump. I like the fact that it has no casino and it's a nonsmoking hotel. A major plus was the courtesy shuttle to and from The Forum Shops at Caesars Palace and Wynn Las Vegas. The hotel is not on the strip, but strip adjacent. It is across Fashion Show Mall. \n\nWe booked two rooms and it was convenient that they were connected by a small foyer. The bed was comfortable and the bathroom was spacious, with a spa tub. You don't even have to go to the pool. There's also a TV in the mirror and a phone next to the toilet. Perhaps it's for someone who runs out of toilet paper?",3
Great spot for lunch! Had a Cesar salad and the Bianca pizza. The crust was cooked perfectly. Will be back for more!,3
"Very inexpensive. Stop by here if you want a quick meal on the go  like a pork bun or something. This bakery was I believe the first one to open in Chinatown on that particular street. Now there's bakeries left and right opened. Anyway I like their Hong Kong milk tea, always order that or the egg tarts! The egg tarts are cheaper in Chinatown than they are in the Guy one actually for some reason, well last time I checked. I haven't tried their cakes, but their pastries are ok. Some are too sweet I find. I'm not that into Asian pastries unless it's green tea/durian...so i'm a bit biased. But worth checking out for cheap snacks/cakes.",2
"Heute Mittag habe ich das Memo probiert und einen Yufka D\u00f6ner bestellt.\n\n\n Das Restaurant ist nett eingerichtet und sauber.

Im Vergleich zum Aroma auf der Kriegsstr. zum Beispiel, bin ich weniger begeistert.\n\n\n Die Hygiene in dem Laden ist sicherlich einwandfrei, allerdings w\u00fcrde ich mir nach jedem Kontakt mit Kleingeld w\u00fcnschen, dass die H\u00e4nde gewaschen w\u00fcrden, bevor mein Yufka gerollt wird.\n\n\n Fazit: Empfehlenswert und lecker - allerdings ist meines Erachtens die Konkurrenz besser.",2
"I have been going to this 24 H location for two years. When I started it was decent, now it is terrible. Downhill all together. \n\nHalf the cardio equipment is broken on a daily basis, the smell is terrible in there, always out of sanitizer and paper towels, the front desk clerks are somber and unattentive. The AC was broken on and off throughout the AZ summer and the front desk would deny it was broken one day, then the next day a different person would admit it was broken and in process of being fixed. That whole ordeal lasted a few weeks. \n\nThe only positive is the classes. They are always enjoyable and the instructors are great!",1
"A foodie friend we travel with found out about this place from somewhere and decided we all neded to give it a try.\nBy far the worst service I have ever had on the strip, bar none.\n\nWe waited 15 minuted for a table (not that big a deal) , however after we were seated it took 10 minutes for a waiter to wander over and take our order. We actually have to stop him from running off so we could order our sides.\nIn his haste to get away from doing pretty much anything, he managed to get a couple of orders worng, but our group of friends are pretty laid back about it and didn't bother to mention it. It literally took 35 minutes for our food to get the the table and by then it had apparently been sitting because the fries were cold and the burgers lukewarm.\n\nThe food itself was OK but forgettable with the exception of the Mint chocolate milkshake one of the group ordered, that was excellent.\n\nNone of us were ever offered refills on our drinks, not even the guy drinking water, of course the waiter woud have had to come to the table to do that. Once the food was delivered we only saw him again when he dropped off the bill.\n\nI may try this place again, as I'm hoping I caught them on an off day, but reading the other reviews, it probably won't be anytime soon.",1
"The Mussel Inn is a solid bet for a cheap lunch. I'm gluten free so the bread is off limits (but I remember from before eating about 3 baguettes worth with my mussels). They do tend to cram you in so probably not the best bet for a romantic meal but for a great cheap lunch with lovely fresh food, then its a good choice.\n\nMussels, chips and a glass of wine/beer/soft drink is \u00a37.95. Non mussel eaters can have cullen skint. Mussels are fresh and well prepared, with lots of options of sauce. I like the white wine and shallot and it does tend to be my default choice. I did find that this visit, I had a lot of closed mussels in my portion which isn't ideal so only 3 stars for this visit but the rest of the family enjoyed their cullen skink.\n\nI'm now as wowed as I was when I first discovered it in Glasgow (they were better at filling the bread basket then) but for a decent lunch in the centre of town, then it is worth a visit.",2
I went to cancom with my macbook pro which had been water damaged. I now realise that is is closed but there was a sign on the outside saying that their technicians are now working at a shop on Forrest Road called SimplyFixIt. There is a web site at http://cancom-edinburgh.com\n\nI took the macbook to them and they were really helpful. Now that they are not tied to Apple's repair prices they were able to fully restore the laptop at a great price. I can't recommend them highly enough. \n\nThe phone number on the poster said 0844 822 6072. Call them and I bet you never wonder about Apple not being in Edinburgh again.,4
Decent food. The servers are friendly. Only negatives-took a long time to get our food and they didn't seem busy. The coffee was too bad to drink.,2
"The story is short: I'm downgrading on price and quality, panhandlers and skateboarders.\n\nThe story is long: Why would you continue to shop at this grocery store? Is it the convenient location? Is it the brand loyalty you have to the Food4Less/Smith's/Kroger/Safeway brand? Is it that you support union businesses? Is it that you like spending more money for the same goods you can find elsewhere? Do you like the people that work here? These are all probably the very same reasons throngs and throngs of people like shopping at this Smith's. And there is going to be nothing but more and more people the more apartments get filled in the surrounding area. And this grocery story will charge more and more money for the same goods.\n\nWhat I do like about this Smith's:\n*) People. Union? Yes. Not a good thing, in my opinion, but they are no different than anyone else, they just trying to feed their families, pay for their healthcare and childcare, and retire comfortably. The people working at this Smith's are some pretty decent folks. Sure, the carts strewn about the parking lot are more the fault of the lazy shopper than the hungover kids hired to rustle them up. Sure, I've seen the same faces year after year at this Smith's, price increase after price increase. Does that mean they are bad people? No! It means they enjoy their job and are paid well so they stay. These are good people.\n*) Convenience. Very close to my home, and also very close to 6000 other people living in the nearby apartment mega-complexes surrounding this Smith's. So I'm not the only one that thinks this location is convenient. My favorite dry cleaner is in the same shopping center, as is Jack in the Box. In store Starbucks and US Bank. Smith's-operated Shell gasoline station.\n\nWhat I do NOT like about this Smith's:\n*) Price of coffee. Cost Plus World Market has better quality for cheaper price.\n*) Price of gasoline. AM/PM (Chevron) and any of a dozen other gasoline outlets within 2 miles of this Smith's has better quality for cheaper price.\n*) Produce. Glazier's Market a mile and a half away has better quality for cheaper price.\n*) Deli meats and cheeses. WAY too expensive.\n*) Price of alcohol. Any of three other supermarkets and any of three liquor stores have better selection for cheaper price.\n*) Pharmacy slow. 2 out of 3 times I had to wait over two hours. In one case, I waited for three hours (while they CLOSED FOR LUNCH WHILE I WAS STANDING THERE WAITING). 20 pills required 3 hours to fill. THREE HOURS FOR TWENTY PILLS. Tom the pharmacist and all the other staff are good people, but .,... 3 HOURS FOR 20 PILLS?!!!\n*) Dairy WAY too expensive. What are these cows...KOBE BEEF?!! \n*) Canned goods WAY too expensive. $1 for a can of store-brand vegetables ... the same can that 5 years ago was $0,25.... really, who do you think you're kidding here with these prices?\n*) Bakery poor and expensive. There are two independent bakers within a mile of this store, all baking better baked goods like bread, cakes, pies, and cookies than these pretenders are trying to do, and they are much cheaper.\n\nI'm very sorry for the tone of this review, and I truly wish the employees of this Smith's all the best and I know they will be very happy to service their burgeoning customer base as it expands ever increasingly. Just I will not be among them, as I vote with my dollars and my feet. So... C'YA! \n\nLast month I spent $10 in this store...and it was all at Starbucks.\n\nAnd finally, if I have to complain one more time about the panhandler kids in uniforms standing outside your stores masquerading as Boy Scouts and Girl Scouts with their sad-sack parents being poor role models hawking dubious fat pills and coupon books, I think I'll scream. And the skateboarders are driving me nuts, skateboarding RIGHT IN FRONT OF THE SIGN that says \""NO SKATEBOARDING\"". Really, management, what are you doing here? I have decided, that was the last straw. Management, pay attention.",1
"This was my first time eating here...unfortunately, it was also my last.  The service was a little slow and the order was not correct; however, that was not the issue. I will admit that the food was good, BUT I immediately lost my appetite when I saw a roach crawling across the floor! To make matters worse, they tried to charge me and my coworker for a large plate when we both ordered the lunch portion. Disgusted is an understatement!",0
"I've been a customer here for many years. relatively happy with everything I've bought so far. i'm not usually the one to read the small print on everything I get. Apparently I've been stung. Feeling really bummed and taken for. FRY's electronics refused ANY negotiation on an RC plane my son bought. $90 bucks for a $4 styrofoam glider with junk servos. I tried peacefully to resolve but \""Manager\"" wouldn't see it - was really good at saying \""sorry\"". Well done FRYS. Shopper beware.\nIt's kind of sad that they sell a lot of products I still need to purchase. But I suppose I can find shrink tubing someplace else. It really sucks to have such a rigid and robotic staff when it comes to returning the product.",1
I agree fully with the review Misti gave on Sherbert overload. Very slow non friendly service and over priced drinks. The staff was very unattentive 3 people were present but (the manager/Owner) was just sitting at a far table on the Laptop while at least 8 people waited. I was the first person in and waited at least 20-25 minutes. I gave them a chance via Groupon but after a $12 meal for small dry sandwich and a sugar overloaded smoothie probably never again. There are a lot of choices out there and I would rather support another place than a place not even trying to do a good quality in all metrics.\nPrice-Fail\nService-Epic Failure\nProduct- Total Fail,1

"Love Great Harvest!  The scones are great, the breads are wonderful - such a variety!  And the low-fat, high fiber Oat Berry Muffins are really good.  The people are always friendly, and I also enjoy their freshly-made coffee.  One of the best things is that everything is made without additives.  I stop there at least once per week.",4
"Taking a cue from the competition down the street and around the corner, TCBY comes back to the market with a serve-your-own format that guarantees you are only as hungry as your wallet and secures bigger sales for this chain.  There are some high points here, but a number of detractors as well.\n\nWhen you first walk in the door you are greeted with the (not so) obligatory (but grossly optional) hand sanitizing station and a choice of 2 cup sizes that rank as large and grossly huge in my book.  This is adjacent to the wall of fro yo, which is a point winner.  Not only do you have the regular flavors you came to love at TCBY (peanut butter and cheesecake), but you also have a few tart yogurt options (again a nod to the competition) and even a sorbet that, while I applaud the non-dairy option, was a little off due to the ice crystals and consistency- not a pleasing mouth feel, especially compared to the smoothie goodness swirling around it.\n\nThe other high point here is the plethora of toppings options that line the rest of the path towards the cash register.  TCBY easily outdoes their competition here just in terms of diversity and number of options.  Gummy worms, candy pieces, hot toppings... yeah it's all here. So are the healthier and more natural fruit toppings.  Still, it's easy to see which category is pushed here.  Whereas PInkberry and Yoforia try and go semi-healthy- TCBY just proudly dumps a vat of hot caramel on their heads.\n\nThe rest of the store is seating and it feels like a futuristic candy drop.  A spartan white interior with clear plastic molded chairs in all colors of the rainbow.  It's almost garish and off-putting.\n\nBut hey, I'm not their target market, as a stop by on a recent Friday night taught me.  Apparently this joint is all the rage with the tween set in the Myers Park and Southpark areas.  I thought I had gotten caught up in an 8th grade field trip.  The store staff did not seem to mind, but they know their customer base.  \n\nFor me, I'm more likely to get it to go next time.",2
"Yes, Please! $40 for an endless gourmet buffet- how could you go wrong??\n\nI usually stay at the Cosmo, so going to Wicked Spoon is just a few floors downstairs! All the food is either placed in its own dish for you, or a food service person will place it on your plate. - So there is no need for anyone else's hands to touch your food like other yucky buffets. \n\nThere is Everything from veggies, salad, fruit, grade A meat, to dessert and charcuterie.  Drinks are extra, but it's fun to stay longer with friends to digest your 'first meal' then get seconds!\n\nI love everything Cosmopolitan :)",4
Really good and inventive food. Great atmosphere and great service.,4
Great hotel with a lot of great amenities!,4
"We received great service from the host, but once seated the service just dropped off.  Our server was just unavailable. It took forever to get basics like silverware or water, and the chips/salsa were probably a good 20 minutes after we sat down.  We waited so long just to get our cocktails that we started playing the game, \""So...do we leave? Do you want to leave? Where would we eat dinner? I'm so okay leaving, I have no problem getting up and just going. Lets give it 3 more minutes? What time is it now...\"" But then our cocktails were served and we felt we had to stay.\n\nMr R ordered a really good pork plate. I had the short rib enchiladas. They came alone, without any sides except for a few greens on top. It was all really good. I was very impressed with the kids menus - tons of options for $4-6 a plate. We ordered a $5 plate of the green corn tamale which came with rice and beans. The tamale reminded me more of a corn casserole - not my favorite (nor the favorite of my 18 month old, but he had spent an earlier part of the dinner sucking green salsa off his chips and eating crayons, so not sure his opinion should count).\n\nThe patio was beautiful and heated in December, it was a decent place - just not someplace I'd go again.",2
"This place sucks so incredibly hard!  Avoid at all costs.  The doorman is a complete jackass, and they have the audacity to charge a cover for this gyp-joint.  The music is incredibly terrible, too.  It's basically the kind of place that smarmy morons go to get hammered.  The Pittsburgh police sit outside smoking cigars (yes, for real) and I saw them let many obviously drunk drivers go without incident (though I suppose that could be a pro for some of you).  Regardless, this place is for losers-- avoid!!!",0
"I LOVE Zuma. I hate the celebrity bar tending night which is possibly Wednesday? But, I love the regular staff that you encounter on any normal night. While in school I lived in walking distance from Mill and Zuma quickly became my favorite bar. I was able to celebrate my 21st birthday here and then continue the tradition of coming here ritually every weekend for an entire year - oftentimes during the week too. The bartenders (Chuddy, Tommy, Tony, Mike) are all so friendly and easy to talk to that they are half the reason we came so much and so early. Most people don't start the party until later but we were always at Zuma during happy hour or for burgers just to hang out. Once everyone does pile in - it gets very crowded and very loud. You should get bottle service. It helps a lot and if you're tired of dancing you can sit down and drink. I love this place and can't wait to go back and see everyone! \n\nOh, plus - if you can stand the smell of alcohol after a night of slamming it back, they have unbelievable burger baskets. I believe it's 3 toppings on your burger (including cheese/avocado/bacon & many others) plus fries for 5 bucks. Talk about a deal and something great for a hung over stomach.",4
"My mother and I just returned from The Keg in Old Montreal. We had a perfect meal there -- I wouldn't have changed a thing. The wait staff was very friendly and helpful, we were seated before we were expected (we were told it would be a 30 minute wait) and we had excellent service.\n\nWe split a filet mignon encrusted with blue cheese and almonds -- mouth-wateringly tender. The goat cheese appetizer was delicious too. I was too full for dessert, but I love the fact that they offer \""bite size\"" desserts so that you can get just a taste to satisfy your sweet tooth.",3
"If you haven't visited Rullo Di Pasta recently, you need to check out all the new items.  The pizza has become our favorite, there are really good take and bake pastas and pizza AND giant cookies and cupcakes.  Not those little \""eat in 1 bite\"" kind, but \""split with someone(s)\"" size and so beautifully decorated.  Also, they serve breakfast now.  I haven't made it there for breakfast ( yet) but buy the big, puffy bagels regularly (only .99).  Very handy to Urban Active, Pikes  and Pawtique.  Yum.",4
"I just recently moved to the Phoenix area and I was looking for a pizza place to try out, and Spinato's was suggested since the owners are from Chicago and so am I. People thought I would really enjoy the pizza because it has a Chicago taste. The service was decent and our waitress was nice. She seemed a bit stressed out because the restaurant was literally packed full. There was a wait to be seated but since I was just in a party of 2 they were able to seat us in the corner immediately. \n\nMost Italian restaurants I have been to give you bread and butter at your table for free but Spinato's charges $2 for their bread abd butter and when it came to the table I wanted to laugh. It looked like a mini kaiser loaf that had been cut into 5 pieces. Then we had to ask for Olive Oil and Parmasean...isn't that standard at Italian restaurants? \n\nWe ordered our pizza and when it came to the table we were ready to dig in and try this famous \""Chicago Style Pizza\"" but quickly we were disappointed. There was NO FLAVOR, all you could taste was sugar from the sauce. It did not taste like pizza at all...the sweetness of the sauce was just to overpowering. Had we not been hungry...we probably would have opted to not eat and just leave to try someplace else. It's a shame that this is supposed to be a Chicago style pizza because in Chicago, we definitely do not have sauce that sweet! The waitress clearly knew we were not satisfied, especially when she asked us if we wanted to box up the leftovers and my cousin said \""yea i guess we can find someone to feed it to\"". She just looked at us as if to say \""ok\"" but never asked us if there was a problem.",1
"It's unfortunate their menu only has 4 sandwiches on it. The food was good, albeit leaves a lot to wish for. It came on a plate with a couple olives and nothing else. I would expect more for the $9-11 price tag. \n\nThey market themselves as a sandwich shop but I just don't buy it.  More so, it was a hipster hangout where it seems people go to look cool.  Granted, the few items the did have were quite good, but I just expected a nice turkey sandwich, but that wasn't happening.  \n\nThe service was on the verge of incompetent but the owner did swing by with a loaf of bread.  Too bad we had to ask for oil at the counter to dip it in (our waitress was absent).  \n\nTheir water was unpalatable and they didn't have a lemon, lime, orange or anything wedge to make it slightly less offensive.  My friends that live in Phoenix told me though, this is just the way it is there.   \n\nAll in all, I certainly won't be rushing back but there is plenty of room for positive improvements.",1
"We were in Phoenix on business and went to Kincaid's for dinner. We have a gluten allergy and usually find steak and seafood places to have \""safe\"" options for us. \n\nOur waiter was friendly and asked if we had any questions on the menu. We asked if they had a gluten free menu and he said no.  Then we asked about some of the menu items to see how they were prepared so we can determine if they were gluten free.  The waiter left and sent the manager over.\n\nThe manager was very unhelpful and said everything on the menu had gluten in it. Even their mashed potatoes and all sauces and dressings.  Then we asked if we could get a grilled piece of fish with no sauce. He said all the fish was already prepared with the sauces and crusts on them. The only thing we could eat on the menu was the scallops...but they were out of scallops. He said there was a book in the kitchen of the ingredients for all of their dishes but the book was too big to look through. \n\nThe table of 5 next to us were unhappy because the manager said he was too busy to split their check for them into two payments. We were so turned off by the lack of customer satisfaction that this manager demonstrated for us and for the table next to us.\n\nAfter going through this for 45 minutes, we left frustrated and hungry and drove 5 miles to Ruth's Chris where we had the most amazing dinner you can imagine. They had a gluten free menu, amazing service and the Chefs did not miss a beat on anything!\n\nI will never go to Kincaid's again. Terrible experience.",0
"DON'T EVER ORDER FOOD FROM THIS RESTAURANT\n\nI made an order on a sunday night through justeat.ca, still hadn't received 5 minutes after the estimated delivery time, called them, they told me the delivery guy was on his way, 20 minutes passed, no one showed up, I called them again, they said the food should be here any minute, another 10 minutes passed, I called justeat.ca's customer care and it turns out, their delivery guy hadn't showed up to work. If they had told me this when I first called them, I wouldn't have to wait an extra 30 minutes to order food from an other place.",0
"Still love this place and the \""beer tasting beer\"".\n\nMy wife and I just visited the new location and expanded Biergarten.  Fantastic!  \n\nI hope the get a more permanent beer kiosk for the Biergarten -- perhaps a chinesisch T\u00fcr like englischen G\u00e4rten  im M\u00fcnchen.  The lines are shorter outside, but the beer is colder inside.  \n\nThe food options have expanded and this place will be on our return list, and always near the top.",4
Last two times we came here the food wasn't great and both times I had hair in my food. :(   Don't get the deep dish pizza - no sauce of cheese. The regular pizza us pretty good.,1
Annie's Pet Parlor has always impressed us.  They are kind and gentle.  We plan ahead so paying with cash has never been a problem.,4
"They were playing some Kenny Loggins, but then they switched the station. No one turns off good ol Kenny. I saw Kenny back in 87 in Memphis, and that was one hell of a show. Chow mein here was dry.",0
"The goods:  Service,  by the servers and sushi chefs were good.  Happy hour sake & specials pretty reasonable.  The food:  Most of the sushi was just average and some was not good.  Overall I would go back, but only for a few items that you know will be good.  For a new place the decor could be much better.",2
I loved this place. I'm a huge Batali fan and was worried if his restaurant would hold up in Vegas as often those of celebrity chefs do not. (See my review on Alain Ducasse's Mix) and I was not disappointed. The food was fantastic. Wine parings delicious. I had the pasta with lamb ragu and it was amazing. Everyone else had either meat or pork and they loved it. I would absolutely return.,4
"Review is for the Garden Bar.\n\nWe stopped by for a beer and a Lemon Drop. Mmm, nicely made!  Great view of the tropical garden area too!  Very relaxing!",3
"Not worth it.  First, we went to a 4pm matinee and it cost $24 ... that is $10 more than seeing a matinee at our usual theater.  Then we ordered some of their Italiano (sausage and pepperoni) pizza.  It tasted like bad frozen pizza and it was $10 per pizza.  The ice tea was $4.50 for unlimited refills, but it didn't taste good and we couldn't even get the server to bring us a glass of ice (since they put hardly any ice in it).  The popcorn was $7.75 with unlimited refills, but I was the only one eating popcorn and didn't need refills.  My usual theater gives me free popcorn if I spend $20 yearly for a t-shirt and $1 drink refills on their souvenir cup.  Our total tab was around $64 including tip.  Thought it was just too much for bad food.  Seats are okay, but I find them uncomfortable since I don't like to lean.  They aren't really any more spacious than a regular theater since you have the moveable tray.   I think I enjoy eating at a restaurant and then seeing a movie; I would spend some time talking to my spouse when I go out.",0
"We visited Blanco Scottsdale for the first time and came away impressed.\n\nBlanco's is one of the Fox Restaurant Group places, and it is a nice concept in upscale gourmet Mexican food. http://www.foxrc.com/\n\nThe Chicken Fajitas were flavorful at $15.00, as were the Machaca Tacos for $12.00 and BBQ Pork Tacos for $11.00 (See photos). The Ground Beef Nachos ($12.00, plus $6.00 for a side of Guacamole) went pretty quickly. \n\nOur lunch bill for a party of four came to $68.53 before tip and everything was very good, though admittedly some of the portions were small.",2
"Not impressed at all. Service was extremely slow. Not the servers fault, though. I would say that the management was at fault here. One server for an entire area, with two tables of eight, in addition to smaller parties. While we were eating a party of at least 50 trailed in. Looks like someone unloaded a bus. For a party that big, I would say that would have been a \""special event\"" and it should have been handled in a reception area. The food was okay. Very, very pricey for tacos and chips and salsa with four drinks. The bill was $160. $14 chicken tacos, and that included nothing else...just 3 small tacos. Once again, the old \""Vegas\"" has given way to nothing more than tourist traps. Sorry, but Macayos would have been a better option. This \""nouveau\"" Mexican cuisine is nonsense, and is made for the young, pretentious crowd that will pay \""bottle service\"" at ridiculous prices and go to \""new cuisine\"" restaurants to say they've been there. If you want good chicken tacos go to Faustos. This place was a disappointment, but then again so are most tourist traps.",1
"Revolution Ale House has all the makings of a good place, but it somehow just didn't really hit the mark for me. The wings were pretty good, though I only had the garlic parmesan, and they came as part of a beer and wings deal (half a dozen wings with a beer for $10). The crust was the best crust I've had from a restaurant pizza in a long time. The ingredients seemed like they were pretty fresh, but the combination of the ingredients together--at least in my pizza--didn't deliver as much as I'd hoped. I had the ogre, which came as a recommendation from the waitress. I pretty much would've eaten the crust with the sauce that came with the garlic knots, but everything else was kinda unerseasoned and less-than-satisfying. I probably should've done what another member of our party did and just ordered the wings. \n\nThe service also left much to be desired. I understand that we had a big group (8 people), and there were two more that came way later. The waitress was very, very nice and was cheerful, and we liked her overall. However, it wasn't busy and there were a few things that we had to ask for several times. I don't think I've ever been to a place where I waited 10+ minutes for my beer to come out. We sat there for over 20 minutes before the garlic knots made an appearance. We had to ask for water several times (but she was pretty good about asking if we wanted more beer), and everything else moved a little too slow (not the waitress' fault, I know, but it's counted as part of service). It's an ok place, but with the other offerings available in Charlotte, it's hard to see myself making a point to return.",2
Every other time I go in there something happens to the order. Tonight I went in there with 3 other people and after sitting there for 40 minutes the waitress tells us there was a mix up and our food will be right up. Of course it came up 5 minutes later and everything was ice cold. Then i tell the waitress we dont even want the food at this point and she says she will send the manager over which took another 5 minutes. We didnt pay for anything and left which was fine but Ive also had a similar experience going in there in the middle of the day when we were the only people in the place. Cookings wings isnt rocket science and this BWW is now equally as bad as the one on Craig. I guess I will try the Galleria Mall location if I want to go to one again.,1
We booked 3 rooms for 1 night so we weren't too conserned with how nice the hotel was but this place was a nightmare.  We requested new sheets for 2 rooms because of blood and other stains. The first room they came and said it was the best sheet that they had and the 2nd room they handed us a balled up sheet for us to change ourselves. One room had a smoke detector covered with a plastic bag. A very large disturbing strain on the spring board too. All were very dirty with stains from floor to ceiling.  I think many rooms around us were families living there. We all woke up to a domestic dispute in the morning.  Pay the $20 extra and stay somewhere else.  My friends wont let me forget about this pick anytime soon...,0
My husband and I got takeout last week... Decided to try something new. We ordered the meatball appetizer and got a meatball sub...meatballs did not taste or look homemade. Pizza crust was too chewy...also did not taste fresh. Lots of good choices in N Las Vegas --this isn't one...,1

"REPOSTING THIS, GOT DROPPED PERHAPS BY THIS SITE'S REVIEW FILTER BECAUSE OF MY ORIGINAL 1-STAR RATING? \n\nGAVE 4-STARS JUST SO THIS REVIEW IS GONNA STAY UP.\n\n(I believed others' reviews that's why I had my car serviced here. Unfortunately, I didn't have the same luck as them)\n\nI was supposed to give them 3 1/2-stars when I went there 2 weeks ago for my Passat's oil change. A mile away from my place, half an hour wait time (Wed or Thurs morning), slow wifi but pleasant staff, not pushy trying to offer extra services. But last Sunday, while driving on 215, I suddenly heard a loud dragging noise under the engine. Turned out, it's the plastic belly pan (sound deadener) covering the bottom part of the engine! The dowel pins may have not put back in properly that's why they popped out! Called VW dealer earlier, a belly pan costs $200 + tax (kit including pan and attachments, pins) no labor cost yet!!! To think VW dealer only charges $65 for synthetic oil change; cheaper than Jiffy Lube! I will never go back to Jiffy Lube! Costly mistake!\n\n (This review was posted on 06/4/2013)",3
"Ordered the veal parmigiana, waiter commented \""it was the best in town\"", and I was not disappointed. It was DELICIOUS!! The breaded veal was thin and crispy, not oily or soggy, and it was  huge -like 10 inches in diameter - and came with a bowl of spaghetti. It was very fresh and tender. Hubby ordered the spaghetti with meatballs and the Filet mignon meatballs were similarly fresh and very tender.  Highly recommended for fantastic Italian food!",4
"I wanted to transfer two of my dog's RXs from another store to CVS for the $25 promotion they offered with these transfers. The pharmacy assistant refused to honor it at the pharmacy because I didn't bring the coupon. I asked the manager if they would honor the gift card without the coupon and he said, sure, \""Tell the pharmacist I said it was fine.\"" I did, then the pharmacist stalked over and chewed out the manager and came back and said, \""He shouldn't have told you that!\"" \n\nCustomer service rule #1 violated: Don't argue in front of customers.\n\n#2: Don't be rude to customers.  \n\nMy other prescriptions will remain at Walgreens.",0
"Ok then.  I reviewed many of the other reviews and thought I was in for a treat.  What a disappointment.  I have eaten here before, when the restaurant was in a corner off of centennial parkway. I didn't think it was that good then either, but I thought I would give it another try,\n\nI ordered the traditiomal gyro platter.  It came with rice, salad, pita slices and dipping sauce, and a gyro pita sandwich.  I tried the rice first.  It was bland and dry.  The salad was good, at least the lettuce was fresh.  They gave me some little slices of pita bread and a little bit of dipping sauce.  Once again, bland. Then I tried the gyro.  It looked great.\n\nNow I have eaten quite a few gyro sandwiches from different restaurants and am usually satisfied with the taste.  The meat (lamb in my case) is what makes the sandwich.  Oh my gosh what a surprise.  The meat barely had any flavor at all!  Additionally,  it didn't look like it was completely cooked and was very light colored.  It was so bland I didn't even eat half of the gyro.  Very disappointed.\n\nI'll give you that the place is nicely decorated and the service staff was good, but the food just didn't cut it.  Prices could be better too, but they weren't that bad.\n\nWon't be going back here, not while Paymons and my favorite, Yassou Grill on charleston/buffalo are still open.  The food at those two is much better than here.",1
"Ok. So I just left this place and I must say the atmosphere is amazing and the music is great. They are also open late, which is wonderful because I stay up late! \n\nUnfortunately, their main point is lacking: the food itself. The broth was basically onion water and no amount of hoisin or Sriracha would make it better. And I swear that was mint and not basil.... I just think they don't know much about Vietnamese food. They should switch to something else. I have never not finished a bowl of pho. Ever. I also never pause when I'm eating it. Lol.  But this bowl was hard to get through and I didn't even make it all the way. \n\nThe service also was not great. We waited like 20 min before our order was even taken. And when the waitress came to take it, she walked up and just looked at me with an expressionless face. Awkward. I ordered, and it took like another hour to even get just my pho out(which should only take 10 min), and another 10 min for my boyfriend's rice. He was disappointed too. 11 dollars for something so small. Didn't even taste like the Vietnamese dish. Anyway, we felt ignored all night and the waitress was awkward and emotionless. \nI usually tip pretty well because I work in the food service industry as well, but I just couldn't tip well. :/ I'm sorry.",1
This company is great!! Three pleasant and professional gentlemen arrived at our door less than an hour after we called. They efficiently removed our furniture and were on their way I would highly recommend this company!!,4
i Can't believe the customer service i just received from Maria the Manager of this place i called to make a complaint and she started to argue with me on the phone and once i asked for her name she hung up on me and i had to call back to get her name and she continued to argue with me and then i asked for her district managers number and she continued to argue and told me to call the 800 number without giving it to me. i will never go to dominos again because of this experience. everyone should stay away from this place. from a once loyal customer which would order every week.,0
"We always hit this place when staying at the Belllagio.  One of the best shrimp wonton noodle soups I've ever had with giant shrimp packed into their wontons and a delciously rich broth.  Also have had the wok-fried Penang style Kweuy teaw with beef and it was perfect with very tender beef.  Don't know about the fancy dishes, but stick with the noodles and you won't be disappointed.  I don't take price into account in my reviews, because everything in the casinos is overpriced.",4
"I was looking for a coffee shop close to my husbands work to study at & decided to search for one on Yelp. This place is really quaint & the employees are really friendly. They use Intelligentsia which is a massive plus. It's a little hard to find because the sign says \""Sell Us Your Gold\"" but from what their barista says they are planning on changing the signage. Definitely going to regular this place.",4
"I love this place. When you think of a Hawaiian BBQ kind of place, I'm sure L&L might come into mind at first, but once you try Ross J's, your Hawaiian food referral is switched. \n\nStarting off with their service, the staff is friendly and gives off their local Hawaiian feel. (I'm from HI myself) I love the locals service. They're all very welcoming and patient, especially when their lines are longer. However, I feel they're somewhat under-staffed during certain shifts. \n\nI've eaten here about 4 times and I cannot get enough of the garlic chicken with gravy... What I love is that the gravy isn't too salty, so the flavor of the chicken is what you're tasting with the compliment of gravy. I did try their loco moco, just because my boyfriend ordered the garlic chicken already. Their pork patty to eggs to rice ratio is right on the dot. \n\nThe seating is limited depending on the hour of your visit.  If you're dining in, they serve your entree on large plates. Overall, all visits were worth the drive and money. Youre leaving with a happy stomach :)",3

I asked for a refund and she yelled at me again because I took my receipt!!!  She is a raging witch!!!",0
"A good pub is a wonderful place. Done right, it's a second home for those of us that like to bend an elbow.\n\nNow, Vegas doesn't have a perfect pub.  The main problem in our city is that every pub ruins its ambiance by installing those damn video poker machines in the bar.  And part of the greatness of a pub is a spacious wooden bar (uncluttered by anything except empty pints). So in Vegas, we already start a star down (try resting your elbow on the bar with those blocky video poker machines in the way).\n\nBut when you lower the bar for Vegas, Crown & Anchor is an excellent choice.  They have a solid selection of British, Irish and American beers and a decent whiskey collection.  Add in a nice dart board and a solid crowd of good-humored patrons.  Head there for a big soccer match or rugby match and you'll find a nice batch of rowdy fans yelling at a television.  It's comfortable and fun, with tasty fried food and drinks.  What you'd expect from a good pub.\n\nAnd there are some advantages to drinking in a Vegas pub.  Like all successful Vegas businesses, Crown & Anchor has perfected the art of hiring sexy wait staff.  The staff is very easy on the eyes and a vast improvement from the brown teeth and rolly-polly figure you'd find in jolly ol' England.",3
I dont know why I let Pizza Hut trick me into ordering their pizza with their 'new crusts' their pizza still sucks as bad as it did when my parents used to force that crap down my throat years ago. Havent eaten it since then and dont know why I ever bothered to try them now they STILL SUCK and probably always will.,0
Not sure what kind of sheesh they use but it tasted like ash. After the owner yelled at me for having my feet on the table he changed the hookah. It still tasted like a cigarette. If you're looking for a good hookah lounge go to white cloud.  Also I wanted a coffee and they're machine was broken.,1
"I absolutely love this farm.  I tend to get here early because it gets crowded fast.  Bu not to worry, they are constantly refreshing the produce as soon as they are pulling it out of the ground or collecting the eggs from the chickens.  This place is a little oasis and I bring visiting family here all the time.  The kids have a great time exploring the farm, pretending to be cowboys and playing in the teepee. \n\nParking does fill up fast at the main entrance but there is parking in the back as well.",4
"Good prices, cheap gas, but I wouldn't trust the meat here.",2
"what do you do when your friend is on a winning streak at the craps table? You go outside and eat some pink's hot dogs! That and the fact that we had a coupon you couldn't go wrong. \n\nThe hot dogs were decent. Being from NYC we're not used to have so much stuff loaded onto the dog. Had a chili cheese dog and a Reuben. Quite tasty indeed, but nothing to brag about. Filling? yes. It didn't taste like rubber hot dogs, and it wasn't a dirty water dog, but hell why not? Try it if you're in vegas, use the coupon people!",2
Tasty food for a reasonable price.  Not the nicest venue however if I lived in Edinburgh I would frequent this place for sure.,2
"No big loss here - 100 year old cigarette smoke dripping off the ceilings , not exactly prime nightlife too bad it closed . I almost shed a tear .",1
"Went here on a Friday night with a friend for some beer and good Southern cooking. The beer was good but I was ultimately disappointed with the food. We shared a pulled pork sandwich, a plate of baby back ribs and fried chicken.\n\nThe pulled pork sandwich was the only good thing we ate that night. The meat was tender and the bun to meat ratio was acceptable. Coleslaw as a side was traditional and served its purpose. \n\nThe ribs were mediocre at best. It was a bit dry and the BBQ sauce had a bit too much molasses for my liking. \n\nThe fried chicken was the worst I've had in awhile. One piece was so dry I couldn't eat it. I asked for yam fries and they gave me half regular fries and a small portion of yam fries. Sigh. \n\nThe service was awesome but I don't think I'll be coming back here unless it's for the pulled pork. Let's hope they improve.",2
"Went the other day and tasted the fried green tomato burger (pretty good) and the fries (very tasty).  The food was not bad at all.  Still, I'm not really digging this place.\n\nWW is basically a sports bar.  I don't know if it's a chain, but it has that feel (drab uniforms on the staff, an overly planned \""warm\"" decor, etc.).  Drinks are pricier than at any of the surrounding watering holes (except maybe Thomas Street Tavern).  They were out of the cask ale that I had gone in to try.\n\nOh, and the music was horrific.  Not sure if that was the house's choice or if there was a jukebox in there, but there was a lot of recent top-40 formula pop going on.  No me gusta.\n\nAnd then there's the absence of prices on their drink menus.  Very tacky.  It makes ordering a drink a bit like getting a new corporate credit card.  You get the bill and realize you should have asked more questions and read the fine print.  Luckily earlier Yelp reviews warned about this, and luckily we weren't there for shots of whisky anyway.\n\nHad to try it out, but won't be back.  Since they seem to be packed every time I drive past on Thursdays - Saturdays, they won't miss my patronage.  Best of luck.",1
"Not sure how the levels of service vary so drastically between Starbucks, but this location is literally the worst one I've ever been to. And, it is unfortunately the closest one to my house. The service is always extremely slow, so decent personalities behind the register and no noticed care for their customers. I've been at this location several times hoping it wasn't just one bad day, but it's been every time. Why does it take over 10 minutes to make a passion tea? And no \""sorry for the wait\""? This location really needs to get completely restaffed.",1
"We will looking for some atmosphere. We drive by, place looked busy outside so we yelped and decided to go in. We were seated quickly and very nice waitress came over to start the night. Great wine list but very overwhelming. Not cheat. Appetizers we good. The naan was good but avocado and lump crabmeat tower  was awesome a must. Then we ordered the grille with a choice of different 1-2-3 skewers. Not bad but not worth the charge $$. The entertainment was fun. Wait staff dropped a few glasses at different times to keep us alert.  Service was great.",2
"$61.95 state inspection for checking in here. I was invited last night to a new owner's dinner and orientation of my new car. The food was good and the presentation was fair. They had door prizes and afterwards you could talk about any issues.\nI met with the service team regarding my upcoming apt and got my concerns resolved.\nI still have trouble understanding my new vehicle. I waited until nearly everyone was gone to get a \""fast\"" overview. I had to end up reading the owner's manual just to figure out how to turn things off.\n\nOn the overhaul picture however, I have dealt with this dealership before since I owned an car with them. They have a nice service department. Wifi and cellular service is bad although you can get wifi in the internet caf\u00e9.\n\nThey talked about schedulilng online. I am still having trouble with this feature and prefer to call. They do however do good work in maintaining my vehicle.\n\nI only go there due to convenience to my home. They are good rated but after last night's event much leaves to be desired.",2
"I have never had East African or Ethiopian cuisine before. I was hesitant to try Buraka at first, but I was pleasantly surprised. \n\nThe Samoosas and the fried plantain appetizers were delicious. Most of the main entrees at Buraka are curry dishes. I tried the Dorowot and the Siga Alicha and both were pretty tasty. The good thing is that for adventurous patrons, there's an option to try a combination of two dishes and do a half-and-half. I highly recommend that.\n\nThe service at Buraka is great, so ask for recommendations. You won't be disappointed in their food.",3

"Bily Kun - why ostrich heads? It is very possible that any other animal head peering down at you from above while you consume your delightful drink of choice would cause an entirely different feeling. Cow heads? Pig heads? No. No. Thankfully, the bar is dark and there are other things to attract your attention. Such as the young and old milling around, the drink in your hand, and the live music that you may have been lucky enough to catch before it abruptly ends. \n\nThis Czech bar is a local hit and you will rarely find it on a slow night. The cocktail list is pretty unique, with booze from Holland, Mexico, Poland, and of course the Czech Republic. The next time I return to Bily Kun, I may just try something a little more adventurous than my blonde beer. Maybe some absinthe, or a fernet and tonic? It's sure to be a tough decision, but lucky for me, I have seven ostrich friends to help me decide.",3
"Ok so the food was pretty good, though we only had appetizers. The fries and gravy and bacon were awesome, but only good in small quantities. It was a Monday night and the place got slammed as we walked in and they only had one waitress for about 8 tables. She was great and did extremely well considering. The crawfish and shrimp tacos were a steal at two bucks a piece.",3
"Egg-themed breakfast places...our market is inundated with them. Each one has it's own little piece of flair that they bring to the table to set it apart from the rest.  The Good Egg actually has a couple of highlights that will undoubtedly bring me back.\n\nFirst things first...I love the menu! It's breakfast, so of course, there MUST be eggs! This menu offers an obscene number of options. The part of the menu that most intrigues me is the healthy options section. There's something called \""La Casa Potencia (Power House)\"". This thing is DELICIOUS! \n\nThe power house has 6 scrambled egg whites w/ diced chicken, fire roasted green chilies & bell pepper, topped with fresh pico de gallo. served with house black beans, a large whole wheat tortilla and salsa. All said and done, this delicious concoction has 51 grams of protein. FIFTY ONE GRAMS OF PROTEIN! Now THAT'S the way you want to start your morning!\n\nOne quick word to the wise. If and when you order this meal, find a way to get the beans on the tortilla without the juices. If you just dump the beans on top of the eggs, you'll end up making a great burrito...that leaks like a sieve. So, it's delicious...but it's messy. Still...worth it!\n\nA common theme in my reviews is my love for a good outdoor seating area. This particular location (one of 15 in the Valley) has a PHENOMENAL outdoor seating area. It's absolutely gargantuan. In all honesty, I think it's about the same size as the actual seating inside the restaurant. \n\nWhen we were last there, it was late morning. There wasn't a single drop of sunshine shining directly on the patio. Needless to say, the weather was fantastic. Granted, it WAS in early fall, so the weather is typical perfect. But, in the summer time, this patio is still going to be shaded from the sun, thus, a great way to enjoy the outdoors without completely melting.\n\nIn the Valley, you have dozens of egg-themed restaurants from which to choose. However, I feel like I've found my favorite! Low calorie/high-protein menu, great prices!\n\nVIVA BREAKFAST!!!",3
"Great alternative to a Starbucks.\n\nWhen I was in college this was my off campus place to study.  It was in a location a little further down in the same shopping center and didn't have an ice cream shop but pretty much the same place.\n\nThere is always at least one flavor to fit your profile for the day.  They will let you try a few if needed.  You can buy beans in bulk as well.  After receiving your \""cup o joe\"", all the accoutrements are right down the line on the back wall.  I love the fact that you have choices in creamers and sugars.  I'm a half and half with sugar in the raw kinda guy and I'm quite particular about that, unless almond milk is available.\n\nThere are plenty of seats, inside and out.  Magazine of all sorts to read, along with creative loafing.  All in all, this is probably one of my favorite coffee shops in Charlotte.",3
It's one of the few places in town with good fondue and Sunday nights with 1/2 off steaks,3
"Eh. Average pho grub. Hipster-ish waiter/aura. Pretty empty on a Saturday night.\nThe service was not bad, just slow and lack luster. The waiter was nice but not very attentive since he was also setting up for karaoke. They were out of Thai tea and took long enough for me to contemplate going I  the back and making it myself.\n\n\nWhen we initially walked in no one acknowledge us. We asked the the bartender if we should seat our selves and she said \""Oh, yeah.\"" \n\nGuess that's what I mean by hipster vibe, not just the fashion but the blas\u00e9 attitude.\nNothing to come back for.",1
"Okay, so they sell out of class packets, fine. But then they send an email informing you that the packet you ordered is ready and to pick it up at the express will call station which is reportedly open Saturdays. It is not. Super unhelpful, especially when you can't even leave a message and are instead faced with an unending loop of ringing followed by a request to leave a detailed message which is followed not by a beep but another round of ringing followed by the same message....ridiculous.",1
"I'm prohibiting myself from going back.  I mean, it's small, can become overcrowded and nothing spectacular.  I need more.....period.  If I'm going to spend my money on spirits and a good time I know me well enough to know this place isn't going to cut it.  \n\nBest thing about the place is the photo booth in the corner of the bar.  Congrats to the marketing team for putting it there.  Other than that....not impressed.",1
"I have never had a bad experience at this location, and I've been coming here since it opened (not sure what the other reviews are talking about). We have a few favorite servers we ask for by name.  \n\nIf we try something that isn't great, we let them know. But that is rare.  And usually if we try something new they are promoting, the servers will tell you if it is a good item or not so good (so if you aren't sure, ask them). \n\nThe servers are always attentive and fun. They take care of us and really do great with our 5 yr old.",4
The way you order is similar to Chipotle but the taste is not similar to chipotle. This place is just so good. I recommend a try. I always go for the fire grilled chicken salad with black beans and no rice with everything else on it. I love that this meal is cilantro and lime flavored. Their cilantro ranch is basically what makes the flavor. I order it this way because the entree is quite a lot. I would always share with my boyfriend because of how much it is and how full I'd get. Place is so worth a try. There's other options of meat and different ways you can have your food prepared.,3
"So this was my first time trying this restaurant and it will certainly be my last. I went in with positive expectations for this place after reading reviews here on yelp. First off my fianc\u00e9 and I came an hour and a half before closing and were told that we couldn't do the AYCE. We sat down looked at the menu, ordered some drinks and if you're like me and hate tea and sodas you are screwed and will have to suffer with disgusting tasting water. Seriously, no juices or anything... For starters we ordered some gyoza which was nice until we tried what we thought was soy sauce and turned out tasting like pure vinegar. For our main we both had ramen with sushi on the side. I had tonkotsu with California rolls and I have never eaten ramen and sushi so bad. The broth was REALLY salty, the noodles and the pork were super chewy and the Cali rolls tasted so plain. Same with his meal might I add. Also, total mood killer! The music. It might just be me but I don't want to hear \""what does the fox say\"" on full blast while I'm eating my dinner... Last thing (I promise) when we left it was about half an hour till closing and I had noticed some of the chefs go out front. To get some fresh air maybe? NOPE! We were greeted with the smell and sight of cigarettes and beer as soon as we stepped outside the front of the restaurant. Disgusting. Great way to show off your restaurant... How this place got best in Vegas I do not know! Don't go here, you will be disappointed like we were.",0
"Just outside of the Linq, nice place with tons of beer choices.  Food was ok, almost like TGIF.  It felt processed.  Not chef quality meal.  Prices are average for Vegas.  Good for kid's because its loud.  Service was ok.  Our server would not be found for 15 minutes at a time.   Menu does offer Gardenia tofu based meats.  Meh",2
"Their Pizza is OK.  Tried it several time but have nothing good or bad to say ... just ok.\nI am a fan of their Balsamic grilled chicken salad.  Chicken is marinated and it tastes great, love the cheese and the walnuts as well.  I can taste the basil in the salad and I like the flavor it brings.  I would strongly suggest asking for dressing on the side.   Couple of times I forgot to ask for dressing on the side and my salad was drenched in dressing...\nI will be back but just for the salad (with dressing on the side... lol) not the pizza.",2
"Being a 20yr Executive Chef,  let's start off by saying every dish is meticulously prepared using the finest ingredients. I was especially impressed with the cold bar. \n\nI've tried many of the Brazil grills here and by far,  this Restaurant surprisingly out shines them all by a mile. \n\nMy tip would be, pace yourself at the cold bar no matter how great it is. I always tend to fill up before I flip my card to start my meats rolling in. They will come quickly so to keep the meats hot, flip the card over to stop and eat.",4
"This restaurant is in the middle of \""San Marcos Square\"" in the Venetian.  Yes, the square is kinda cool, it looks a little bit like the real thing.  Postrio is nice, the hostess was absolutely a charmer.  Service was great.\n\nI had the rib eye salad special, which was nice.  The appetizer was a gazpacho that was advertised to be more like a soup with lots of interesting things in it, such as panzanilla.  It ended up being gazpacho in a large bowl with about 2 tablespoons of things in the middle, including bread crumbs.  Too much tomato, which was rather plain, and not enough of the interesting things in it.",3
"It's in Encore, so of course its pricey. But the happy hour isn't bad. Monday through Friday, 4pm to 7pm, two for one drinks. $13 fruity drinks or $6 beers FOR TWO. Food wad decent but still overpriced for happy hour. Money not being an object I'd totally chill here.",3
Best ob/gyns!,4
"I havent been here since this was Acme. \n\nWent here on Saturday night for a friend of a friends CD release. They utilize the alley between them and BS West as a patio. The downstairs seemed alright. Bar, booths, stage. \n\nWe decided to get away from the crowd and go upstairs.\n\nDear Scottsdale (ahem) ladies, If you plan to wear your stilettos and come here, do not go upstairs. Especially if you plan to driiiink. They are very steep and not very forgiving.\n\nThe patio was very nice. It provide the perfect acoustics for the band playing downstairs. There is a bar up here, though they seemed to be out of everything. The bartender was not very attentive, but also not very busy.\n\nIm not entirely a fan, but Ive been worse places.",2
"We ate the Gambler's Special, the $7.77 Steak, Shimp, and Potato meal.  The steak and shrimp were surprisingly delicious considering the price.  The potatoes weren't the best I'd ever had, but 2/3 ain't bad.  Remember this item isn't on the menu, you have to ask for it.\n\nThe other menu items seemed to be moderately priced, but I probably wouldn't eat anything other than the special.",2
"I'm really surprised The Clarendon is getting anything above two stars. Our stay was horribly disappointing. As I type, we are on our 4th night of a 5-day stay and have had to ask for linens to be delivered to the room EVERY DAY. The first three days, housekeeping supplied towels for one person to shower. My husband and I considered a game of Ro Sham Bo to see who got to be clean that day, but instead chose to call down to the front desk to request linens be delivered. \n\nWe had to call three days in a row to ask for linens and to have the bathroom cleaned, trash emptied and carpet vaccumed. By the 4th day the floor had been vaccumed and the trash emptied, but there were NO LINENS AT ALL.  After another call to the front desk, towels were sent up, but without wash cloths. The young man stated there were no more wash cloths in the hotel and there was nothing he could do about it. Then, ANOTHER call to the front desk and a few minutes later we had washcloths. \n\nHad we not already pre-paid the entire 5-day stay, we would have checked out and been happy with a Motel 6 an hour away. Heck, I would have called my friend in Queen Creek and asked to stay in her barn. We could bath in the trough and dry ourselves with a horse blanket.",0
"Interior: 9/10, Food: 8/10, Service: 9/10.\n\nGreat dining experience.\n\nInterior is very interesting. I came with a large party, so we didn't get a window seat. Would have been spectacular if we had a better view.\n\nFood was very ornate. May have looked better than it tasted, but it was still delicious.",3
This Panera provided me all my favorites.  I stopped in for lunch and worked for a couple hours before my meeting.  My only gripe is that's it's 3:30 in the afternoon and no one has been around once to wipe tables. (over 2 hours) Trust me its not busy and are staff are chatting it up in the back.   My advice...  wipe your table down before you sit....  Food is Great per Panera standards,2
"This place was PACKED at lunch, so they must be doing something right.  But it's definitely not the Pad Thai.  They sat me immediately, and took my order fairly quickly, but then it was over a half hour before I got my entree.  The Pad Thai was edible, but seriously lacking in flavor.  I asked for it medium spicy, but there was no heat whatsoever.  Just a bland, almost maple-syrup flavor.  I would have asked for some hot sauce, but between delivery of the food and the bill, nobody checked on me.  Guess I can't complain too much, however, as it was relatively cheap.  (But isn't most Thai food?).",1
"Got some carne asada for dinner tonight from La Palma. The meat was good quality but I wasn't too impressed with the marinade they use.\n\nThe marinade was pretty bland and didn't really add much to the meat. However, the price was decent compared to some so I guess it's a trade off.\n\nAlso, I was a bit disappointed with the guy cashier today. He couldn't stop running his trap to a friend, in Spanish, and take the time to devote his attention to me, a customer.\n\nMeh, I've experienced better.",1
"I adore Soho. My husband and I travel to Vegas on business twice a year for several weeks at a time, and lately I have found so much delight in the gems located off the strip rather than on. Soho was one of the best finds we stumbled upon. The quality of ingredients at this sushi restaurant are top-notch. While ALL sushi restaurants really need to ensure their food served is of the utmost quality and freshness, sadly this isn't the case. But no worries with Soho. \n\nWe ordered several appetizers (including the rock shrimp with dipping sauces, omg!), seaweed salad, edamame, miso soup, sashimi and then a bunch of rolls for our dinner. While a \""veggie roll\"" is not very exciting nor is it ever really worth mentioning - theirs was so good I nearly fell off my seat. The asparagus used inside the roll was SUPER crunchy and I honestly thought they executed this normally bland roll perfectly. Also, the crispy crab roll was one of the best I have ever had in my life.\n\nI would also like to mention that the owner/chef was by far the nicest gentlemen I have ever had the pleasure of meeting. He came by our table several times to ensure we were having a good time -- he sent the sashimi compliments -- and he also came by and asked us if we wanted dessert on the house. We said no as he was already too generous, but what a great person and what an amazing experience!",4
"Nice location and the staff is very friendly and seemingly proud of the place - I was not so impressed - the chairs, stools and table sizes and measures are .. odd. Not comfertable and I was struggling to get comfertable. Finally settling at a table in the back I feld like Alice in Wonderland as the table side came to just under my shirt pocket. I am 5'9\"" when standing up so this was a little awkward. I was pleasantly surprised with the platter that was served and the beer selection is good . In all I would have liked it here more if it wasn't for being so uncomfertable.\n\nThey have a small but well presented food list - vegetarian option and locally sourced. As they were just opened the portions were generous when I visited, but as with many places that serve food that will probably be evened out over time.",2
Way too heavy handed with the salt!! I wanted something light so I ordered vegetarian - Enchilada Verdes. The black beans were so salty they were inedible. The enchiladas were drowning in cheese and didn't feel light at all. This felt like horribly processed chain restaurant food but cost about 50% more.,1
"For downtown phx, this place was once pretty cool.  But the 'bigger' it got, the portions got smaller, the food got worse and the service got snottier and it's pretty much a skip now.\nI do love a few of the menu items.  But I think its mostly due to the large amount of MSG used in the them and the excellent tofu preparation.  The sauces are one step from the grocery store otherwise, and hugely overpriced for what they are.\nThe concept of making people wait even when the restaurant is empty is ridiculous.  It doesn't make you look cool, Fate, it makes you look like you don't give a shit about your customers.  Also, the hiring practice there seems to be 'no serving experience, vapid, hipster, 'hot' girl?'  PERFECT!  and thus, the service often blows.  (save for a few servers that have been there forever, and are awesome)\n\nI used to love this place when the food was better and it was less pretentious years ago.  Now its just overrated and overhyped.  A true sign of how a lack of competition allows even the worst to survive.",1
"Not sure what was wrong with me, I noticed that I gave La Barquita a three star.  I apologize for such a low review.  There rice is great, and the food is nothing but quality.  I get the soup, I suggest for those colder days or sick days to try it out.  I\""m glad so many other people tried this Mexican restaurant its not an easy place to find.",3
"Let me just start off by saying, I always, ALWAYS go on yelp before I go to new restaurants. Judging by majority of the amazing reviews, I decided to finally go today with my boyfriend. YEAH, i'm going to make this short and say REALLY? this place is just like hometown buffet. It was super packed (&i know its only because its new & there isn't one near by) but the food wasn't that great. Nothing stood out to me.",1
"Never thought I would miss Mez, but the SMG really screwed up a great concept. I went recently for a movie date and now I wish I saw it in a theater without so many distractions. I don't think 5 minutes went by without a server walking up to a seat. \nBeyond the distractions, the pizza we ordered was less than decent, it was barely cooked. \n\nGoing forward I will be grabbing dinner somewhere in Phillips place and seeing a movie there.",1
"Meh...I went here for the Lakers game today.  They have appetizers, burgers, sandwiches, ribs, and salads.  The O'Connell burger that I ordered, which had bacon was just so-so.  The fries were decent.  The Coors Light was a little flat.  Overall, just an average sports bar.  The crowd here seemed a little older.",1
"Okay, I favor down home Mexican food, and this places rocks!  Don't expect much by the way of decor - but since this doesn't affect the taste of the food, I'd rather not pay for it anyway!  :)  The place is an institution and the locals love it.  I love the hot sauce, while my husband prefers the strong onion salsa.  The refried beans are great and the shredded beef on the nachos is the best around.  If you're in south Scottsdale or north Tempe, check it out.  You can't beat the taste or price anywhere nearby.",3
"In comparison to the SOMA store in St. Armand's Circle SARASOTA, FL, this store pales to comparison and must lose a lot of potential sales.  I know I'll never come back.  I was looking for a couple new bras and post holiday sale PJ's for my sister.  I was greeted asI walked into the store but, nobody offered to help me.  All this time one sales associate was helping a customer and the other three were just hanging out and talking among themselves.  They were dressed in black but, no name tags so, it was confusing to know initially who worked the store.  At the Sarasota SOMA store they wear dressier black outfits and name tags.  I finally flagged down a person and asked her if she worked there.  She was while helpful while her other three co workers did nothing.    She wasn't forthright about the sale of two bras, as she was trying to sell me the ones not on sale and didn't speak highly of the embraceable style, which clearly fit the best on me.  She was also off with my bra size but, my selection was correct.  She didn't offer to size me and none of the staff members had tape measures.  In Sarasota, they all have them around their neck.  My mom, who's not as SOMA savy had a similarly disappointing experience where the manager couldn't be bothered and the part time employer wasn't alerted to a free panty item.  It's too bad as SOMA has a unique opportunity to create a wonderful relaxing, appreciative and completely catered shopping experience for a woman.  I personally couldn't get out of here fast enough and spent less than half of what I'd normally spend.  Their clothes selection is extremely limited and this is the only semi annual sale were so many items seem to still be so high in price or not on sale at all.  During my checkout experience my saleslady was needed in the back to help another customer so she asked another associate to take over my sale.  I visited this woman was not happy to do so as it was not her commission and it was pretty apparent.  The lack of teamwork at the store among the associates is painfully obvious.  They all need to spend a day at the Sarasota St. Armand's Soma and let Yolanda and her team show how it should be done.  The Charlotte women are unfortunately missing out on what should be a fabulous experience#missingSarasotsSoma",0
Nice ambiance but pasta was dry and cold,1
"We go here about once a week for happy hour.  The staff is very friendly and efficient.  They take the time to get to know the customers and know when to look for a refill.  Good, not great, selection of tap beers - all good and interesting but not extensive. The bar food is excellent - predominately gastro-pub.  The slider trio is great and the margherita pizza is one of the best in town.  We also enjoy the carne asado & queso dip.",3
"HORRIBLE and OBNOXIOUSLY LOUD MUSIC, BAD STAFF ATTITUDE, UNACCOMMODATINGLY UNREASONABLE to the Ravella hotel guests.  REFUSE TO PATRONIZE THIS PLACE AND TELLING ALLLL MY FRIENDS TO AVOID IT WITH A 6 FOOT POLE.",0
"The claim as Montr\u00e9al's best coffee is highly dubious. But, my beef with this little shop and cafe was rude attitude of the owner. After waking up early to drive up to Montr\u00e9al, we needed a caffeine boost and catch up on social media. The service was lacking from the get-go. We weren't allowed to order at the counter; instead, we had to be seated to order our coffee. From there, we were ignored while we waited to place our order. We had to ask her three times for the wi-fi and even then, she was immediately distrusting of our intentions as she warned us not to download anything on her personal wi-fi. The coffee was also sub-par. I thought Canadians were supposed to be nice? Must be a French-Canadian thing.",1
"These folks know how to move people through their establishment. Front counter staff friendly and efficient. Concierge was very helpful and friendly when booking shows and tours. \n\nHotel restaurants were expensive but convenient. The fast food options were useful and inexpensive. Take your pick.  Lol\n\nWhere we had an issue was with the room itself. We arrived and the first thing we did was check the room for cleanliness. There was body hair in the bed and icky looking white spots all over the bathroom floor so we called the front desk.  They immediately and courteously moved us to another room that was in much better shape although obviously well used. \n\nThe new room was clean but there were skid marks on the office chair and the lampshades on some of the lights were broken. (see pictures) \n\nOur daily housekeeper did a good job of keeping our room clean and well stocked with water and coffee supplies. The in-room coffee maker worked well and made surprisingly good coffee, one cup at a time. \n\nThe bed was surprisingly comfortable and the pillows fluffy. I usually don't sleep well in hotels but I had no problem sleeping here. I was really pleased with the mattress and pillows. \n\nOverall, the hotel is nicely equipped and convenient to the strip. Parking is problematic while construction is underway next door on the new arena. \n\nBe aware that while the facility overall is quite nice, the hotel rooms themselves are not in good shape and getting pretty ragged around the edges.",2
Its ok but I never seem to enjoy myself when I am here. I would rather drink at home.,1
"I had the opportunity to stay at this resort as a sort of \""staycation\"".  There is no question that this resort is beautiful.  I think it has declined slightly from its  heyday when it was a awarded the Triple A 4 Diamond award in the early 2000's.  Despite the slight decline, I definitely enjoyed this resort. \n\nOne of the first things you will notice when you arrive is that this resort looks exactly like the picture.  Its very pretty  and the grounds are well maintained.  \n\nAs far as the amenities are concerned, there aren't many.  I thought that the swimming pool was a little small and the area around the pool, in general, could be updated a little.\n\nI stayed in a king suite and the room was pretty large.  i definitely appreciated the space.  I loved sitting on the balcony in the evening time and watching the sunset,  In the evening sun, this place, the grounds, the desert, the mountains in the distacet, EVERYTHING looks beautiful from your balcony.  Every room has a beautiful view.  \n\nThe rooms are rustic and are somewhat outdated.  I recall the phone in the bathroom being an old fashioned telephone from 2 decades ago.  And normally, I couldn't care less about the things in a room when I'm on a vacation because I'm too busy running around, but considering the fact that I was there to get cozy in the hotel, I wanted to have some modern amenities like a flat screen TV and dare I say it, WiFi.  For some folks, this might be heaven, for me, not so much when my cell phone was in and out of service.\n\nIf you visit this resort, keep in mind that the streets in F.Hills roll up and the shutters are closed on businesses fairly early.  The resort is within walking distance of a shopping plaza that has a grocery store and some other food stores. \n\nI will say that I was a big fan of the staff at the resort.  Extremely helpful and just simply nice and accommodating.  \n\n I would certainly go back here.",2
The first time was great. The next 3 visits a disaster! Food has gone way down in quality. Horrible steak on visit #2 and the clams got us sick on our last visit. Not to mention the lack of attention from the waiter. At the prices they charge the service should be fabulous and friendly. That it was not!  If you must...the calamari and the meatballs are good.,0
I came to Camden pines to get away from the streese's of life not to see more of it there is drug dealers gang bangers and there is no security guard you can never get a break even if you try to go for walk you  have to watch yourself because thepeople drive like maniacs and don't care who they run over,0
"Cripes, do I even have to give one star? Pedro's is about as Mexican as I am. Bland food and flavorless sauces abound. I feel you could order anything on the menu and wind up tasting the same food. Everything was just bland and limp. This is the worst kind of faux-Mexican food the world has to offer. \n\nTL;DR: Bleh.",0
"OH nay, fancy chinese food=not cool.\n\nWhere's the fatty stuff? Why is the service super dee duper slow?\n\nThis place was nice but when I envision chinese food, I see cheap, \""unhealthy\"", just throw it in oil- food. I expect food to come out five minutes after you order it. HOT and FRESH and DRIPPIING IN FLAVOr. This place wasnt it. SO AMERICANIZED. When I eat chinese I expect to get 6 entrees for, eh, 60-80 bucks. For 60-80 bucks here, I go two entress that didn't even fill me up. And whats up with all the healthy american ish? No skin on your chicken? ---- not authentic chinese.\n\nBut the employees were on point. I guess.",1
I hope this place is around for a long time to come.  The meats are fantastic and the owners friendly.   They were closed for awhile but we are so glad that they are back!,4
Folks are nice and they do a good job. You can't beat the straight razor on the back for the money too. Worth the wait if they're a little busy.,3
"I was absolutely starving so I looked around and saw chairs outside on a patio. When I walked up to First Watch I was a little confused. Their logo seems more like a diet organization than a restaurant in my opinion. Maybe the cafe needs to be a little larger.  \n\nI sat down with one of my friends and we ordered. I love breakfast and the omelette I ordered was not satisfying at all. The eggs seemed greasy and no one wants that when you order egg whites!  My friend took two bites of her pancakes and didnt want to eat anymore. \n\nOverall, we will not be returning!",1
"Decided to have dinner here when looking for a byob in the west island. This place is a bit far out if you are not from the area. The ambience is nice and the resto seems very well kept. The service here is great, our waitress was attentive and the hostess was very welcoming as soon as you walk in. \n\nI started with the eggplant parmesan which was average, covered in cheese and sauce, you almost wouldn't know there was eggplant with your cheese. For main i ordered the chicken tagliatelle. The pasta was perfectly el dente but i would have like more flavour out of the chicken. When seeking to liven up the dish i did discover they have a very good chilli oil for those who like to add a bit if spice to their pasta. Overall a nice byob place with a vibrant ambience.",2
"This company is Awful! We have tried several months for Larry Smith to return our calls. He is evidently the manager, and seems to never be available , or doesn't know how to use his phone. We paid several thousand dollars for a transfer of our timeshare which they never completed. Never use this company!",0
Great food and the lunch specials are great the ckn pram is the best and love thier alferdo scaue is the best,3
Je donne un 1 sur 5 pour le peu de pr\u00e9sence du fran\u00e7ais et du non respect de la loi 101. Le menu est \u00e9crit en genre de franglais mais c'est sous entendu que l'anglais est prioris\u00e9 par le personnel et le propri\u00e9taire malgr\u00e9 que la majorit\u00e9 des clients sont francophones. Les serveuses te regardent d'une fa\u00e7on m\u00e9prisante et parlent dans ton dos quand tu demande un service en fran\u00e7ais. La nourriture est quand m\u00eame bonne mais le service est mauvais et lent. Le prix est relativement \u00e9lev\u00e9 et la bi\u00e8re est un peu tiede.,0
"This is really sad, as Osaka used to be relatively good.  Here, specifically are my issues from my visit last night:\n\n1.  WAY too expensive for what you receive.\n2.  Quality of fish is near rock bottom.  Toro at market price ($24) was not fatty, nor do I suspect, tuna.\n3. Tako was just chewy rubber\n4.  It took forever to get a carryout order.  45 minutes to be exact.\n\nSushi Wa is MUCH better.  I think I was spoiled by Yoshida's in San Marino, CA.  Definitely the best",0

"I normally am pretty nervous about ordering Chinese food to go. It usually ends in a horror story.\n\nThis was not the case! \n\nAlright, so this is my first time ordering from China Jade and though it was unfortunate that there was a $15 minimum, I had no problem filling my order. They were, firstly, quick and timely. It said 45-60 minute wait, but they got here in 40. AWESOME! On top of that, Dominos pizza has a higher delivery rate than them. And I don't even LIKE egg rolls, only adding them to the order to try  out, but I LOVE these. They even gave me an extra one. \n\nNever had Chow Mein and I got mine with shrimp. Tasty for a first timer!\n\nHowever, the sesame chicken wasn't fabulous. It's usually my favorite Chinese food, however this one wasn't great. I've found, though, with Chinese, it's really hit or miss with sesame chicken.\n\nNot to make it too long, but I enjoyed it. I'll definitely order from them again.",3
"Overall The Signature at MGM was a decent stay. The best part was the rooms- modern, clean, and comfy. I usually struggle to sleep in Vegas with the so called oxygen pumping into rooms, but I did not find this to be an issue with SIgnature, maybe because it's technically slightly off the strip and more of a condo style hotel. Undoubtedly my most restful stay in Las Vegas, out of many, many visits. \n\nAs most Vegas beds are, Signature's are very comfortable, and did not disappoint. Bathroom was nice with the shower & tub, and I was lucky to get a balcony (upon request!). I was extremely excited about a blender for some less pricey frozen drinks for the pool, but unfortunately never even put it to use.\n\nYou will see mixed reviews for the walk required from Signature towers to MGM Grand. It wasn't bad, but I don't mind walking. For those lazy people, you will not want to stay here. I was in tower 3, which is the farthest from MGM & the Strip. It was about a 5 min. walk to the MGM pools and a 7 min walk to the casino, and probably a 10 minute walk to the strip. They do have flat \""escalators\"" to make the walk better.\n\nThe ability to use 5 or 8 or however many MGM pools is a plus, so many pools, lazy rivers and poolside seats to choose from. This was a plus. Someone going #2 in one of the pools and closing down was not a plus, but this is my second time in Vegas (first not at MGM) that this has happened....so maybe it's more common than I think and certainly not the hotels fault! But seriously, how does that even happen? On a side note, Wet Republic is also a plus for the day club partying type...just expect to thrown down some $$. There's also the option of the Signature pools (three of them) but they are a lot more low-key-I did not get a chance to put them to use as I was looking to P-A-R-T-Y for July 4th & my 30th birthday.\n\nThe MGM casino is one of my least favorite on the strip, it does not have much character to it and is outdated, compared to many of the newer casinos. This is not a huge downfall however as you can just walk to any casino nearby and are not stuck with the one you're staying at. I also find this casino to be a bit too smokey for my liking. \n\nOverall service at the hotel was great. I usually love to stay at a new hotel every time in Vegas so I'm not 100% I'll return, but the main thing that would drag me back was the quality sleep I got at MGM Signature.",3
"Great food, very cheap and only five minutes in a cab from the wynn casino. It is great for lunch and to get away from the fast food chains and expensive restraunts on the strip, would definitely recomend.",3

I have purchased pretty much every lifetime service they offer on both of my vehicles and can say they stand by their warranties. The entire stuff is friendly, honest, and always entertaining!

"The suites are nice and although the lines are long it moves fast. The check in person we got had no personality which sucked...but I have to say thanks as we missed our flight so came a day later and they still accepted our online booking. What I disliked the most about gambling here was that every time I lit a cigarette at a smoking table, the pit managers would come by and make a rude comment. Such as \"" hey [dealer name] do you smoke?\"" She said no he turns back and says looking directly at me \""well you do now\"".... And similar remarks were made such as\"" that smells disgusting how can you do that\"" ??!!!???!!! Had I known MGM was so anti smoking I would've gladly gambled elsewhere!!! It's a nice hotel so I'll give it 3 stars but I've never encountered such rude floor managers in Vegas!",2
"I can sum up my experience like women's comparing of guy's units: falling short in expectations..Yeah sorry, that's all that came to mind.\n\nI tried the world renowned blue cheese chips and in my view the salt in there was so overpowering that it did make it a bit unpleasant to get down and it didn't help either that they lost heat pretty quick. I did like the water if that counts?\n\nEntree wise since it was lunch I went with a pizza and although I don't remember what I had exactly I do remember the taste and alas it tasted just like the name: a puck. Well maybe not that far, but it by no means has me coming back for more at all.",1
"we checked into a 2 bedroom suite and what makes their 2 bedrooms unique is that you essentially are getting a 1 bedroom suite and a studio suite together. so its basically like you are getting 2 rooms next to each other that share an outer door. it kinda seems cool at first but the practicality of it wears off as soon as you enter. since you basically have to prop open the 2 front doors to each room. we actually got locked out within a minute of walking in our room because i put the keys down in the 1 bedroom suite to check out the studio suite and then my wife followed me into the studio from the 1 bedroom.\n\nthe accommodations and amenities of the room are great though in the 1 bedroom suite. you basically get a full kitchen with fridge, microwave, sink, dish washer, etc. nice choice of chairs and furnishings.bed was really comfortable. the convenience of having ice in the freezer is huge. \n\nloved the 3 headed shower with heads on each side of the bath and the large shower from above. one of the more luxurious showers i have witnessed.\n\nthe pillows were down but incredibly soft. felt like i was sleeping on paper.\n\nour 1 bedroom though pretty much epitomized a party room. upon check in there were fresh wet stains on the carpet. lots of nicks and markings on the walls and furniture. if you told me this place opened up last year i would've been sure you were lying to me. also the coffee table for the living room doesn't match up to the rest of the furnishings. it basically was this plastic flimsy base with a 50 lb glass top to it that was extremely unstable.\n\none of our TVs wouldnt power on with the remote. and the other TV had no audio and required engineering to come up and fix.\n\nall guest services were slow to deliver up to our room as well\n\nwe checked in and requested from the front desk a crib and to have our baggage sent up by the bell man.\n\nafter 2 hours of waiting for our baggage, my wife called the bell desk and they said they had no record of us checking in yet. we checked in at 2pm on a sunday and there was basically no one in the hotel so not like they were busy.\n\n3 hours later and after 2 calls to the front desk did we finally get our crib. \n\nalso throughout our stay the bell men very rarely were at the front doors and if they were, they almost never opened the door for you. there was one bell man there, a younger Asian looking guy that was always very courteous and opening the doors but all the others seemed to care less.\n\nthe simon restaurant was a nice find and the staff there were all so friendly and the food was pretty good. \n\nall in all, i'd probably still consider coming back because having the full kitchen with toddlers and infants is a nice perk and the price is reasonable. \n\noh also, something else that i that was odd and which the front desk didnt disclose was that since i was essentially booking 2 rooms that i would pay 2 resort fees... doesnt really make sense to me though since i am really just getting 1 accommodation that happens to be 2 rooms because of their design. i felt that should have at least been disclosed to me.",1
"Well this place used to have good food, but not anymore.  My chicken was tougher than leather, bland and flavorless.  My husbands's filet was pounded to a paper thin piece of meat... Who does that.

I unwrap the Gyro and immediately I realize that the sandwich is made with a tortilla, NOT pita bread. There was no sauce at all inside the wrap although it was advertised otherwise. In addition to this, the tabbouleh was not fresh at all, and had little to no olive oil - it tasted extremely sour.",0
"For me the Golden Dragon was one of those places you drive by all the time for years, always thinking \""Man, I really need to try this place. There's always cars in the lot and they've been around forever!\"" but inexplicably never do anything more than that.  Well, after approximately 19 years I finally gave the Golden Dragon a try and it was...a valley Chinese restaurant.\n\nI've been on a mini-quest to find a suitable replacement for my former go-to neighborhood Chinese joint (the lamentable Pong Pong on West Bell Road) and so far, so-so.  Therefore I was really hoping that my quest would end with this long pondered destination. I mean, hey, they have sizzling rice soup! That immediately scores a point of favor, right? So here's the rundown \n\nThe wife and I ordered takeout:\n-Szechuan beef\n-Orange chicken\n-Egg drop soup\n-Spring rolls\n-Crab puffs\n-Vegetable fried rice\n\nThe beef itself was good, tender and not over done. The sauce was typical brown spicy-ish gravy. Not overtly oily but commonly greasy.  The chicken was of very good quality, the \""spicy\"" orange sauce was prevalent but the taste was AWOL.  \n\nOn a side note, why is that Chinese restaurants always denote the spicy dishes on the menu? In my experience, this merely means that a dried red pepper will be placed somewhere within the dish, rendering a few surrounding millimeters somewhat hotter than the rest. \n\nAny-hoo - The egg drop soup was all egg flour. That's it, not even a sliver of scallion. Not bad, but barren.  The crab puffs were pretty good. Large, with a better than average filling that contained a fair portion of Krab\u2122.  The spring rolls were pretty terrible.  Oilier than canned sardines and filled with a bland mixture of rice noodles and something that resembled the stuff that oozes out of the cyborgs in the Alien film series. The highlight was the veggie fried rice.  Fluffy, savory, with generous amounts of fried egg and bean sprouts.\n\nAll and all...a valley Chinese restaurant. I think I might have to abandon my quest to replace my old favorite Chinese joint.  Maybe it's not so much that I can't find something suitable, maybe it's more that I just don't really like Chinese/American food anymore. \n\n(Except for sizzling rice soup. Why didn't I get the sizzling rice soup? I haven't had the stuff in eons)",2
"Great atmosphere. \nHORRIBLE food and service.\nWarm sodas for kids.\nChewy burnt chicken strips, cold french fries.\n\nOur waitress was a gum smacking youth who couldn't care less \nabout service.\n\nAnd to top it off, they propped open the back door so those of us\ninside could choke over the cigar smoke that blew indoors.\nOne of us got up to shut it as other table's thanked us.\n\nThis place won't last.\nFood is nasty.\nAnd for $9 you get EXACTLY 6 little ounces of wine.\nPathetic.",0

"My friends and I decided to try out the new Donatos location at Gateway Village. We got pizza to go and took it home for a VP debate watch party. I generally have low expectations for all pizza in Charlotte, but I was pleasantly surprised by Donatos. We all agreed the sauce had really good flavor, and the crust and pepperoni were crispy. \n\nI was just checking out the Donatos web site and noticed that you can order online for pickup or delivery. That convenience is a big plus, and I wish more places had online ordering.",2
"Hands down the BEST Mexican restaurant near Summerlin, or maybe even in Vegas.  I am usually pretty picky with my Mexican places since many places in Vegas seem to have either no flavor or are too greasy.  The service was absolutely fantastic, from the hostess to our server Omar, everyone was very courteous and helpful but not naggy or anything annoying.  It was great.  We were immediately seated and brought chips and salsa and our drink order were taken. We went with the pork and shrimp fajitas, and wow sooooo good. They light them up when it's wheeled out to you, super cool! The veggies, meat, and shrimp had so much flavor.  The tortillas were very fresh and warm.  All the sides: guac, cour cream, pico, beans, and rice were fresh and super tasty! I would definitely recommend this to any Mexican food lover or anyone who needs to be converted.  Definitely my new favorite place!",4
"Wish I'd read the previous reviews before I came here.  A horrible, frustrating, waste of time experience trying to get our RV water heater replaced.  Parts were screwed up resulting in a week's delay, and I had to actually find the part number for them to reorder the part.  Parts were literally double the price of other sources.  I never received most of the calls they promised and getting information was like pulling teeth.  When the reordered part did finally arrive they failed to schedule my RV in the shop and the SERVICE MANAGER refused to come out and meet with me to discuss the situation.  I waited some time and he never appeared, just kept sending out excuses (the general manager did eventually fix the situation, more or less.)  Took 10 days for a 3 day repair and when we finally got so angry we just left the water heater still did not function.  6 Camping World techs worked on it for 5 hours and couldn't get it working.  (A couple of days later a 1 man repair shop in another town diagnosed it and repaired it in under 5 minutes.)  On the plus side they did provide us with a parking spot in their lot, saving us campground costs.  Unfortunately the promised shore power connection never materialized.  Go ANYWHERE else to get your RV worked on.",0
"We went because we were told they had King crab legs.  They were not king crab, but Alaska crab.  A whole lot smaller and different flavor.  Did not expect the crab to be cold!  No small forks to get the meat out, had to use my fingers.  Also, crab meat was watery.  Doesn't anyone know how to properly steam crab legs?  The salads were good and fresh.  My husband went for the roast turkey but instead of carving the whole turkey they were displaying, they cut up cooked turkey breast meat (not the same as a roast turkey).  For the price, not worth it and will not go back.  The waitress we had was wonderful and we did tip her (at least she earned it).  Tried the creme brulee and it was runny.  The spicy chocolate cake was nasty.  The pecan pie was very good in spite of the pre-made pie crust.  (I can tell the difference.)  Don't waste your money unless you just like to try to make yourself feel important by overpaying for a meal.",1
"The hotel room walls are thin...I can hear it all! The rooms are substandard. I'm never staying here again. The staff at the blue man group show are unfriendly. I'm spending $400 to watch a show! At least say \""hi can I help you?\"" Or \""thank you\"".",0

"I've been coming here for years, and have been happy to introduce many a co-worker and friend to Carly's. It started out as just a convenient after-work stop for me because of the proximity to my office, but has evolved into a true relationship. The staff is always friendly and cheerful, they know a lot about downtown Phoenix and will give you the low-down on anything special going on, which is great for both tourists and locals alike. Their food is refreshingly solid and very reasonably priced. I'm getting a little tired of going to these new bistro/hipster/cafe places and being presented with options like \""Pizza with an egg on top\"" or \""Aged cheese-I've-never-heard-of served with thing-I-don't-know\"". Carly's offerings tend to lean toward the healthier side but are also tasty and easy to recognize, i.e. hummus dip with pita bread, anti-pasta plate, chicken sandwich, etc. They have great live music and other special events like Nerd Night fairly often, but not so often that it gets annoying, if you know what I mean. Their location is right on the northern edge of downtown so you've got a good mix of working folks, ASU students, and the occasional downtown weirdo type to make it just interesting enough without being uncomfortable. Beer selection is solid, lots of great local choices, and the prickly pear margarita is fantastic. \n\nHave fun!",3
"Awesome underground nerd bar. You can RSVP tables which I suggest if coming as a bigger group. Service is slow and their prices are pretty much average for beer and food, liquor is overpriced for the most part though but they're downtown so they can get away with it. They have pretty much every kind of gaming console and you can also bring your own. Don't forget the collection of board games including 4 different types of Catan as well as 3 different Fluxx decks. Their BLT and roast beef sandwiches are a great snack.\n\nFood:  8/10 - limited selection\nService:  5/10 - coffee shop style service, your best bet is going to the bar rather than waiting for staff to pass by\nPrice:  7/10 - meh\nAtmosphere:  10/10 - love it",3
"Ok, I really think the overall experience here is sensational.  Fantastic appetizers, wonderful entrees, great wine list, and memorable ambience with the Bellagio fountains.\n\nI've been here twice and thought the place was outstanding in both cases.  We made a slight mis-step with our wine order once, but that was our own doing, not the restaurants.\n\nI think that if you are going to go to a high-end place, like at the Bellagio, this is the restaurant to try.\n\nUpdate:  went for a 3rd dining experience, and again, it did not disappoint.  Great ambience with the evening Bellagio fountains, great service, and an excellent Mediterranean menu.  I especially liked the Carpaccio appetizer.  Still a top restaurant in my book.",4
"We ate a breakfast and lunch here. The food is very good. I had the mushroom soup and a panini and it was tasty. It was a little too much food. The cafe latte and croissants were great. I would definitely stop here again. It is very busy on the weekends, but the wait was worth it.",3
"Wish I could give zero stars!\nWe went to Longhorn Steakhouse last night for my son's 15th birthday.  He has been wanting to go there since it opened.  We were all excited to try it.  Unfortunately we didn't get to.  When we were seated my daughter noticed that one of the small plates we had just been given by the hostess was dirty...really dirty.  Upon further inspection we saw that all 5 plates that we were given upon being seated were dirty\"". They were really dirty and one even looked like it had two small bugs on it.  Yuck!   We have owned a restaurant, so understand that sometimes things happen and a plate might not get completely clean, but all 5?  That's a big indication as to the cleanliness of the kitchen and if the dishes aren't clean what else isn't.  Needless to say, we didn't stay.  We didn't care how \""good\"" the food was going to taste out of the peri dirty kitchen.  We went to Outback Steakhouse ( which was also a first for us) and it was delicious!  Happy birthday, Son\""",0
"I struggle to find what people like about this place. Food is mediocre, service is typically slow, prices are nothing special. It doesn't have a local/quaint atmosphere to help it along either. \n\nEverything about this place is completely shruggable. If there is no place left on your list to go, by all means eat here. But for me, I'll pass.",1

"I came here for brunch on my last day in Vegas. My friend and I shared the house hash with chorizo, jalapenos, cheddar cheese & fresh tomato. We also shared ONE Snickers flapjack with two other girls.\n\nThe hash was delicious! Very well flavored and huge portion size (definitely enough for two people!). But speaking of portion size, the Snickers flapjack was RIDICULOUS! It was about the size of a large pizza... among the 4 of us, we managed to eat maybe 2/3rds of it. Definitely unique! :)\n\nOne thing I do have to comment on is that the waiter service was incredibly slow... maybe they were just having a really busy day, but our server almost never came around.\n\n-L.",3
"I'd have to say it was no where near an awesome experience. We tried to order a pitcher of the IPA and the waitress stops us and is like do you like IPAS? do you know what your ordering? i was like yes i like IPAS im capable of ordering a beer like a grown up. maybe next time be like hey our ipa is exceptionally hoppy compared to other ipas, is that alright for you? After finally ordering a pitcher of beer (there were six of us, so four of us had one beer) the waitress tells us that it is such a high gravity, she says 9% that if any of us have more than three she'll have to start figuring out who the DD is and maybe cut people off. Not only was it an uncomfortable comment, but we looked back at the menu and the beer was only 5.7%. Needless to say none of us wanted to order another round of drinks. Then when the waitress brought out our chili, she told us that the green onions looked nasty and she didn't feel comfortable serving them. I was kind of grossed out by that point. Couldn't you have just lied to me and told me you were out? I don't wanna hear about nasty things in the kitchen, it made me really not want to eat. Luckily the food was good, however the service was reason enough not to return.",1
"Like a modern pop song the Forest Cafe will initially suck you in and smother you in its catchy and enticing charm, but then eventually the novelty wears off and your left with an annoying and lifeless composition.\n\nTrue, the cafe has its unique features: a wholly volunteer run cafe with a trippy, psychedelic interior. On the other hand you'll witness way too many 'too cool for school types' here and the coffee is plain naff.\n\nStill, enjoy the novelty phase though.",1
"Fitzgeralds is like a funky old person in sandles with their toe nail fungus for the whole world to see.

"I was concerned about wait time after reading some of reviews but my experience was fabulous. The two wait staff were quick and even asked if I was on a short time schedule. I had Chef Emeril's signature dish - BBQ Salmon with pork andoille sausage potato hash and onion strings. It was AMAZING! I saved room for the bread pudding (I love bread pudding) and it too was fabulous and yes, you can taste the bourbon sauce ...yummy! Wine + Entree+ Dessert = pricey, but nice splurge",4
"We decided on this place because they had 4 out of 5 stars! What we experienced was a 2 star restaurant at most. Very slow service with no one really in the restaurant. Food took a long time to come out, silverware had food stuck on them, soup & salad came out wrong. The only good part was the homemade potato chips were good.",1
"Literally two minutes from my old home and we were desperate. The place was totally empty at like 8pm on a friday night. My friend ordered the appetizer sampler and I order the spinach salad with no dressing add grilled shrimp! The waitress asked if we'd like to eat \""together\"", weird way to phrase it, and I asked to have both dishes served at the same time.\n\nWell, within 15 minutes the sampler was dropped off, no salad nor waitress in sight.  After about 10 minutes she tops by and I ask about my salad. She sneaks back to the kitchen and three minutes later informs me that it should only be about 10 minutes. She asks my friend if she'd like to have the kitchen \""hang on\"" to the sampler and serve the dishes together in a couple minutes!  It was so absurd, especially since the appetizers were supposed to be served hot and the odd dip had already congealed.  A manager finally delivered  a salad, but definitely not the one I had ordered.  When I noted the error she asked what I wanted her to do, and I asked for the check and sent the salad back. Eventhough no food had actually been consumed she neglected to comp or amend the check! What horrible customer service!!",0
"Yes it's true, it's worth all 5 stars. A quaint little place out of a home renovated into a restaurant. Every server greeted us, asked about us like we were old pals, just wonderful wonderful customer service from the moment we walked in, to the time we left. We had an order of the traditional fresh spring roll which was delicious and fresh, however I do wish they would serve more than just one that's been cut in half. We ordered a lychijito and mango fizz drink which were ehh...okay at best. But We had ordered the spicy shrimp (I forget the actual name of the appetizer), which I could eat all freaking day omg!!! Unfortunately they were out of the pork when we wanted to order the crispy spring roll which was a bummer, but the spicy shrimp was an excellent dish that we forgot all about it. However, if you have a low tolerance for spice, this is not a dish for you cuz it is spiiiccyyyy. Lucky for me, I love spicy foods. Then onto the pho dish itself, now I've had many a bowl of pho, and I'll say it's one of the best bowls of pho ive had. You can literally taste the difference between this $10 bowl vs. your $4.50 pho at a grumpy Vietnamese noodle house who just stare you down as you sit down, and stare at you when you say thank you when served your food. The beef tastes much cleaner, and more delicate. The broth is a good beefy broth that has not been watered down, and even the noodles are of better quality. Yum! Yum! If you're going somewhere else for pho, DON'T!\n\nCame back a 2nd time, not so blown away maybe it was the service the first time that was so awesome but ehh not so much the 2nd. The egg roll has NO flavor and for some reason the Pho here was just not as up to par the first time around. Not to mention it is twice the price as a regular Pho place we just end up eating at Pho thanh on 19th ave and camelback instead.",2
"Went down to check this place out for lunch. The atmosphere is nice, the prices are on the upper end for Mexican food but I'll forgive them that because the food is high quality and prices in the area are high in general. However, the service was poor. The restaurant was slow, and it looked like there were plenty of staff, but we felt like we waited too long to place our order and get our receipt. While the food is good, overall I'd rather eat at Casa Don Juan or Los Tacos.",1

"Very hard to find and looks very odd from the outside or whether or not the restaurant is open, but seriously worth the find.   Amazingly good food especially the broken rice plate.  Better than the other three restaurants that we ate in Vegas and was great.  This place was even better.   Comparable to one of the other top broken rice restaurant that we ate in San Jose.  Pho was also better than the other two top Pho restaurants we ate in Vegas.",4
Went here for lunch it was slow. And you'd think since its early people would be happier to help you but our waitress was kinda cranky. At least the food was good. the portion was kind of small for me. This coming from someone that eats very little. The pretzel that came with the meal was big. It is a try once if you are in Vegas.,2
"Love this bar! Great mix of people, good drinks and cool, relaxed atmosphere...what else can you ask for in a bar?",4
"I went here when I was in Vegas for work. It was a great place to hang with friends and just chill and drink and talk. We even danced a little.\n\nOverall, tiny place. A few places to sit. A small place to dance - good enough for a group of friends. Nice modern atmosphere. One bar. One night the music was hip hop/top 40 and the next night it was electronica. \n\n\nJust come by to this place to kill some time. No cover and no line. But I wouldn't hang out here the entire night. It would get somewhat boring after a while.",2
"WARNING: the pricing and business practices at this business are predatory and deceptive.  Although I was told at check in for upper respiratory infection that \""we take your insurance\"" that DOES NOT apparently does mean that \""we are in your network\"".  That deceptive practice was repeated to me by the intake person, the office mgr, and now the billing department.  Meaning that if you want a $370 out of pocket bill for a 5 minute encounter with a PA (no MDs on duty) and an injection which may nit be covered then go here. If not -- please choose an honest urgent care business that does not charge hugely excessive fees and clearly informs patients of their insurance status before entering an exam room. Disgusting.",1
"I experienced the same thing, except I did not stay. I left and demanded my money back. I spoke with manager Leea and she returned my money. The next day I spoke with the young teenager manager Camele and she told me that their was plenty of seating because she went to the event. She was a very good liar saying that their was plenty of seating. She did not know that I took a picture of the overbooked event, that will be posted. She then proceeded to tell me that Tahiti Village only listens to complaints from nice people insinuating that I am not nice. She would be great in timeshare sales! The staff is hit and miss with customer service. Most of the staff is very nice and courteous but they have a handful of bad eggs that make a very nice resort look bad. Upper management needs to be more tough with their standards. \n          I finally spoke with a actual manager and she was very nice and apologetic. She gave me a free meal for me and my family at their restaurant which was very good. She was very concerned and sincere about how I felt about our stay. I can not say the same for Camele and Leea, both of them are in management positions when they should not. They must know someone to be given a important task being the face of Tahiti Village. They have a communication problem. First , Camele is just rude and sarcastic at the expense of members. Next, Leea is just lazy, by not following up with guests. She would say that she would call at a certain time and then leave you waiting having no intention calling. She ask me to wait for her in the lobby at 9am and never showed up. I finally at 9:45  I went to the front desk asking where she was. She was in the back of the check-in leaving me waiting. \n          The deferred maintenance is too a problem. One of the outdoor grills had electrical wires hanging out the bottom. The elevator in building one had two elevators and one did not work for the first night we stayed. This caused very long lines to use the elevator. Being on the top floor, and going up the stairs was not pleasant. The working elevator makes loud eery knocking sounds while you are in it. If you are to stay make sure that you are in building five because it is newer and maintained. It was strange having to share the elevator with the maintenance staff with their large carts that take more then 50% of the space in the elevator. The resort has potential because the pools are top notch. \n         Make sure to bring your own toilet paper because they only gave one roll for four people at a one week stay. I was told you can just call each time that you need a roll but I find that to be demeaning to have staff ration toilet paper. It is more simple to go to CVS down the street and buy a package for 5 or so dollars. Also, I had to take out the trash because it did not smell well. They told me to just leave it in the hall way. Four hours later the trash was still in the hallway so I took it to the front to ask where I can find a dumpster to through away the the trash. Again the front reception still made it clear that they do not cater to guests. The receptionist told me that I can take the trash to the dumpster at Denny's. One of the bell hops saw the situation and ran to me and told me that \""I could help you with that.\"" He took the trash and was very good and I thanked him.\n          Again, at Tahiti Village they have phenomenal staff that bend over backwards to help and others that are horrible and need to be retrained. This company needs a consultant to help filter these bad eggs. These bad eggs will just destroy the reputation of the resort and when it starts to lose money they will leave and find another place to destroy.",1
"Great bar and cocktails, but very poor service in the restaurant (The Devil's Kitchen). One meal, a steak, was even served cold! Unattentive staff too. Pity, as it's a gorgeous setting. Haven't been in the club part yet.",1
"The outlet mall in Anthem gets its own self-serve yogurt shop. i discovered this by accident on the same day they were having some mall-wide special, which was opening day for said yogurt shop. Pandemonium. I admit, this probably biased my opinion a little bit. Lots of confused people, lots of \""Wow... you do it yourself! What a great idea!\"", as if this was somehow a new concept. Maybe in Anthem...? The lines were wicked long because people insisted on redeeming their 10% opening day coupons (that saved you, what, fifty cents? Way to go, champ!), but that gave me lots of time to eat the pieces of Kit Kat off the top of mine before I paid. (Come on, they don't weigh anything compared to the yogurt.)\n\nSo yeah. These yogurt places are pretty much all the same, except for Yogurtland (next to Sprinkles) which is far superior, but it's nice to have the option at Anthem which is otherwise a deep-fried, extra cheese covered monstrosity.",2
"I am quickly becoming a regular at Charlie Palmer, and for very good reason. The service is top tier ad the food is amazing.\n\nI judge a business by how they treat their customers and I can attest that CP values the patrons that walk through their doors. I've been here several times with my girlfriend, and we have always had a pleasant time, with the exception of one off night. I sent a nicely written email to their customer service explaining that the night seemed off in a way and let them know that I would still be coming back regardless. The way they handled that email sets this company apart from so many others.\n\nThe assistant GM got into contact with me and went above and beyond anything I imagined. Adam's actions on behalf of the company all but assured that CP will have a very long time customer in myself.\n\nThe food is better than N9NE and the staff is knowledgeable and attentive. If you get a chance to check out Charlie Palmer Steak in Four Seasons, do yourself a favor and go.\n\nIf you are budget conscious, they have the Michael Jackson Prix Fixe menu with unlimited wine pairing for $49.00 per person or the Cut of the Week with unlimited wine pairing for $48.00 per person. Last weeks cut was a deliciously prepared t-bone, cooked to perfection. I could go spend more than that on alcohol alone anywhere else.\n\nThis is a great date night spot or a place to get together with friends for delicious food and conversation, but don't take my word for it. Check it out yourself! (anyone catch the Reading Rainbow reference?)",4
Super clean fresh fish!! Best sushi I've had off strip!,4
"The hotel was beautiful, but my stay was awful.   \n\nI only stayed 3 nights, but in that time:\n\n   *  Hotel staff came into my room unannounced after 10pm  (I was actually asleep in bed)\n\n   *  Had personal items stolen from my room.  I know this happens, but I was not able to reach anyone at the front desk by phone.  So I had to go to the front desk, where they just waved me off to security\n\n   *  Requested an air purifier, because of odor in the room at 9 am.  Was locked out of my room (because they secure the room when the purifier in the room) because it still hadn't been removed at 6 pm, even though I had expressly indicated, I needed to be able to get into my room by 5 pm. \n\n   * Security took over 40 minutes to come and let me into my room\n\n   * And finally, the hotel felt no need to apologize for any of the inconveniences caused to me during my stay and have sent me a letter explaining that the hotel was not negligent regarding the loss of my valuables.\n\nI know that others in my group complained about the service and not being able to reach the front desk from their rooms, but luckily no one else had as bad an experience as myself.",0
Been here a few times love it! Great food reasonable prices you can't go wrong and very prompt service!,4
"This place is decent. The service is good and fast, but the food is not great. It's edible, but not good enough for me to go back a second time. I had the Pad Thai and added chicken, which cost me an extra $3. The chicken turned out to be fake and the noodles gummy. I would really not recommend.",1
"Not the hype that was advertised, the view was okay but just another Vegas attraction to suck money. would be cool for a romantic setting if offered a dining experience or something similar.",1
"I've been practicing yoga for a few years so after moving to Pittsburgh, one of the first things I did was begin sampling the local yoga scene.  Due to convenient proximity and the lure of unlimited 2 weeks of practice for $25, south side amazing yoga was the first studio I tried.  Power yoga is not my thing, but I was in dire need of a spring detox, so I signed up.  \n\nNew students should realize that this is an aggressive style of yoga adapted for the westerner who more often than not is after a good workout.   Consequently, a great deal of the philosophy and intention of ancient yoga is lost.  One of my concerns is that it can misrepresent yoga to new students and potentially turn them off from trying more gentle styles that may be a better fit for them.\n\nIn power yoga, sun salutations are performed at breakneck speed and poses are often held for just a split second before it's time to jump into the next one.   What happened to moving slowly and feeling each pose and breath?  A previous teacher of mine translated \""asana\"" as \""taking a seat\"" with the point of the poses being to settle in to them, find a comfortable spot--this is where the meditation and sweetness of yoga seeps in.  It's nigh impossible to do this at the rate at which power yoga classes are conducted, so I just decided to go at my own pace in order to protect my body.   The danger in this style of yoga is that the risk of injury is distinctly heightened in a room that's heated to 90-100 degrees; the heat artificially lengthens the muscles, which enables you to go deeper with stretches and tricks you into thinking you're doing good yoga.  And you may be doing good for your body, but without careful attention and awareness, it's easy to go too deep and cause injury.   Again, moving so fast and trying to keep up with the class, makes it a lot easier to ignore or skip over the messages your body is trying to send you.   Another bone I have to pick is the excessive amounts of chaturanga, which can cause or exacerbate shoulder injuries.   No fun.    \n\nThe instructors generally breeze over these risks, and one must remember that this ancient Indian philosophy has been transformed by Western capitalism into a for-profit industry.  Their motive is to get students to keep coming back.  In my opinion, Baron Baptiste and Bikram Choudoroy have a lot more in common with Billy Blanks than with Patanjali  or BKS Iyengar, but hey, it's all what you make it.  Can you turn this into yoga?  Sure, I can turn going to the grocery store into a yoga practice.  Doing power yoga, you can surrender to the brutal physicality of it and use this to break down the ego.   However, I'd venture to guess that a lot of egos in the room were being strengthened by the power trip this yoga can offer.   To me, it's not inviting the kind of stillness that is essential to real 'progress' in yoga.\n\nAfterwards you feel detoxed and exhilarated (a feeling which can become 'addictive' as a lot of the proponents of power yoga advertise like it's a positive thing), but inspired or enlightened?  Not so much.   Amazed by amazing yoga?  Nah.   I've seen these gimmicks before.  Moving on and looking forward to trying other studios. \n\nThese are just my two cents.  If it's your thing, more power to you.",2
"Sat in the patio area, very nice with the heaters. Started with bean dip, really good. Chips and 3 salsas were great. Cheese/ chicken enchiladas were really tasty. Tortilla soap was good. Service was a bit slow, more servers were needed.",2
"Peppermill, ah peppermill. Not quite sure what kind of a theme they were going for here, but it definitely screams tacky. \n\nThe menu is reminiscent of much pricier Denny's or Norm's, but the sizes are at least considerably larger.  \n\nService is just alright, nothing to write home about. In fact I think the waitress forgot my friend's eggs. Eggs, how do you forgot eggs when it's the most common denominator in each menu item. \n\nI ordered chicken fried steak and eggs, and split that with my buddy who got ribs. Yep ribs. So many it isn't just a glorified denny's after all. \n\nOh and who needs alcohol when you can get a tall cup full of hot cocoa with a heaping shitton of whipped cream. Hmmmmmm whipped cream on top of more whipped cream.\n\nThe chicken fried steak was decent, eggs and taters were done well. The ribs were disappointing. Meat wasn't tender at all and it was swimming in bbq sauce. Probably to mask that concrete-textured meat. And it came with fried rice. Like chinese style fried rice. What the heck was going on with that?\n\nI was told the eggs benedict were good. I can't comment cause I'm generally not a fan, and therefore didn't bother to try it.  I also didn't get to check out the highly acclaimed club part of the diner. LOL. Firepits and loveseats.  Maybe I'd give it a higher rating if I had checked that area out.\n\nBottomline, not bad for late eats, but a bit heavy on the wallet.",2
"You know that yelp is a useful website, when it makes you aware of a place that just opened down the street before you even realize it. I will say that the Daily Press is subtly marketing itself and you could easily walk by the Evening Muse without even noticing it.\n\nThat being said, the wife and I have been there a handful of times now to try an array of coffee drinks that have been creatively thought out and crafted. From cold brew coffee to a \""butterbeer\"" latte, to exotic beans used for pour over coffees, we have tried a good variety of drinks. It's basically open during the day when the Evening Muse is on downtime. They also have a produce framers market on Saturday morning that we will have to check out sometime. The drinks are all expertly crafted, which means other than the cold brew, most drinks take some time to make. Especially if they are busy, be prepared to wait a little for your drink. \n\nWith the relaxed environment and the location, which allows you to observe the corner of 36th street and North Davidson street, there should be no rush. Enjoy your time there and chill out. We can all stand to stop and smell the roses, and the coffee of course.",4
"I came here from NYC, which has a lot of great pizza options. (They also have a lot of crap pizza, but that's a different story). \n\nThe pizza styles at GNP are too doughy for my tastes, though I recognize that some people like it that way. I was more disappointed in the crust flavor, which lacked the savory taste that I was looking for. There are lots of novelty toppings too, like mac & cheese or french fries and stuff like that. Great quantities of things that seemed to be hiding the lackluster value of the crust underneath. \n\nI think the oven isn't hot enough, because I didn't see the kind of char I expect on a pizza, and everything on top got very...brown...instead of molten with a charred crust. \n\nI'll probably try some other selections here but so far, it isn't a match for me.",1
"Good enough to go twice on my trip to Vegas.  I fell in love with the brie and spinach crepe and the cheese board appetizer.  Staff is also very knowledgeable about wine.\n\nEven on a 115 degree day, the patio is comfortable enough to eat on and it's really the only place in Vegas where you can eat outside on the Strip.  Great view of the Bellagio as well.",3
"This fun little bar has become a \""Vegas staple\"" due to one drink: The Darkness.  It's a vodka drink with muddled blackberries, and it goes down real smooth.  Be careful though, there's definitely alcohol in there!\n\nI have met some very interesting people here.  The half-naked dancers and waitresses, good music and readily available cocktails make for a killer combination late at night.  It's off-strip, so it's not as wild as some other places, and I think that leads to more guards being let down.  \n\nOur waitress this past time may have been having a bad night, but she was quite rude.  Take note: if you sit at a table, order from a waitress.  If you sit at the bar, order from the bar.  Don't get confused.  This wouldn't have been a problem if she'd been attentive to our table, but some of the less patient (slightly tipsy) members of our group weren't willing to wait to catch her attention when she clearly wasn't worried about coming back to serve us.  Then she scolded them for going to the bar for service.  Repeatedly.  If she'd told us the rules in a nicer way and then returned to offer drink refills, everything would have been fine.  As it was, I think she lost a big chunk of her tip.\n\nI-Bar is in The Rio so we've ended up going upstairs to the VooDoo Rooftop nightclub.  This is a fun place to start though!",3
"Came to grab a late lunch to-go on a Monday, June 11, 2012.\n\nI was warmly greeted at the door by the hostess and manager.  I asked if I could get an order to go, and they said I could at the bar.  I didn't take pics, so my memory is a bit elusive... but I remember it being very well-lit, and modern.  It matched the space of the Crystals shopping center.  It was very lively, and I was surprised there were so many patrons at that hour (around 2pm).\n\nI got the spaghetti and meatballs, as well as the grilled meatballs.  My friend, Arvin T, had been searching for the \""best meatball,\"" and so I joined him in his search.\n\nI was very tempted to have a cocktail, having glanced a number of tasty looking handcrafted cocktails... next time!\n\nI forget how long the bartender said the wait would be, and I had made a note in my phone (only to have deleted it, it seems)... but I remember it taking 3-4 minutes longer than he said.  Which was fine for me, but for those that are nit-picky...\n\nFast forward, I'm sitting on the couch in Veer Towers (that's why I chose to get it to go -- it was 8 minutes flat, from bar to doorstep), with Mad Men on Netflix... I dig into the spaghetti... it's cooked al dente, thumbs up.  I take a bite of the meatball -- my teeth sink through more easily than anticipated; it's a very soft texture, and I don't like it.  On top of that, it was surprisingly sweet tasting, not in a good way.  Disappointed, I wash it down with water, and give it a second go.  Same disappointment.\n\nI open up the grilled meatballs and cross my fingers... The texture is more firm, like I'm used to.  However, this time it's way too salty!  I quickly grab the water, rinse, and repeat.  Salty!  Deja Vu.  Einstein's attributed quote came to mind: \""Insanity: Doing the same thing over and over again and expecting different results.\""  (He didn't really say that btw, but who knows who came up with it).\n\nWhen my friend came home from work that day, I had saved him well over half (probably 3/4).  He tried it, and disagreed with me about the grilled meatballs being salty... only to recant his statement 4 hours later when he admitted he needed to drink lots of water at dinner.\n\nWolfgang Puck, your meatballs let me down that day.  But, being as sleek looking as you were, I will return to sample your handcrafted cocktails anyway ;)",2

"Great burgers. Since Holstein's went down hill in quality, it's easier for me to give Bachi a solid 5 star rating.\n\nBefore I gave Holstein's a 5 star rating, and compared it to Bachi. But now Bachi is probably the only good burger joint in Vegas (that i know of).",4
Both the steak and salmon were terrific.  They were great about substituting the side dish so I could satisfy my pasta craving. The steak is new to their menu. We made use of their labor day special so one of the entrees was free. A very enjoyable meal. Recommended.,3
"As we entered the bar, a patron of the Onion serenaded us with AC/DC's Big Balls.  It was then that I knew we were in for an good time.  We sat down a the bar and ordered a \""big\"" beer.  Some places offer a tall (22 oz) beer, but these guys don't mess around; they have the biggest beers of them all (to the tune of Big Balls)!  As we entered the wee hours of the morning the karaoke got worse, the beer got better and fun didn't stop.  The beer selection was adequate and they offer full bar.  There were several pool tables and dart boards along with other standard bar games.  The karaoke was light-hearted and we got in on the action.  There was even a little bar fight (verbal) to round out the nights activities.  Good times.",2
"I had this pizza in Brooklyn and thought it was the BEST pizza I've ever tasted. So we had to try this spot when we were in town in Vegas. This is located at Palazzo on the second floor. There was NO wait when we went around 2pm for lunch on a Sunday. Lots of space with a bar. I couldn't bring my fat tuesday in but they were kind enough to store it in the fridge for me. \n\nSo we ordered a large pizza with sausage, pepperoni, mushrooms, and olives. Very tasty and good upon the first bite! We asked for the garlic powder and added to our pizza which made it taste a little better, but the garlic powder wasn't as strong as what we had in NY. I have to agree that the pizza was delicious, but it wasn't as good as what we had in Brooklyn's for some reason. It took about 20minutes for the pizza to come out. We also ordered a personal size pizza with white sauce. I didn't taste it but my friends did and agreed it wasn't as good as the regular pizza. \n\nThe service was okay, the server could put a smile on his face at least. I heard the less toppings you put, the better. Don't overload your pizza! I recommend regular pizza with tomato sauce with basil. A side story: my bf left his credit card here but they were kind enough to keep it until we picked it up. Thanks! 4 stars for excellent pizza and no wait! I highly recommend this spot if you're craving NY style pizzas.",3
"Ok I just reviewed Sirens of TI and said, \""hey its free.\"" This is free and does not scream free, low budget or anything of the sort...duh.  There really is no landmark that screams Vegas like the Bellagio Fountains.\n\nWe have watched it from Mon Ami Gabie in the past and right by it during the day, but this year, I want to really watch it at night.  It's so stunning, not the least bit of a \""small, simple attraction,\"" romantic and always, sophisticated.\n\nFor everyone who says the Bellagio is over (thanks to these new 5-star hotels popping up), it will always have the fountains.",4
"4 stars for the actual mall since it was decent, clean, and there was a wide variety of stores.\n\nI came for Sephora, which was good. The sales associates were very helpful. Then I went to Rainbow for clothes. Good enough selection & prices, but definitely not the best. I give them 1.5 stars... Maybe 2 JUST because the clothes are cheap, but the customer service SUCKS. \n\nWhen I went to check out, the girl at the register was \""busy\"" yapping to another sales associate, sneered at me AND gave me attitude AND THEN made me wait for another cashier to ring me up. Wtf, rude... All I want to do is buy 2 things and you're treating me like I don't belong in your lameass store. I don't live here but even if I did, I wouldn't come back to Rainbow.",1
"More like Le Plop! Second time was NOT a charm. Thought I'd go back and give it another try after a mediocre breakfast the first time. I tried the \""18 Wheeler\"". It comes with eggs, bacon or sausage, \""peasant\"" potatoes and french toast. The meal was just bland, I've had a better breakfast at a T/A truck stop on Route 80. Eggs are eggs, link sausage was barely cooked, \""peasant\"" potatoes were just that, poor! They lacked taste and texture. The french toast was two large pieces of bread, over dipped in a plain, tasteless batter. Using sliced sandwich bread for french toast was sub par for a restaurant with a name like Le Peep. \n\nThe service was fine, the waitress can't help the lack of ability in the kitchen. It has gotten dirtier from my last visit over 18 months ago. The carpet was dirty and the walls were banged up. \n\nLe Plop needs a face lift. In agreeing with the other yelpers, the decor is lacking. There weren't many patrons dining during my visit and it was extremely loud. \n\nGood Luck! It seems their weekend faithfuls keep them afloat! Does the South lack taste buds and palates?",0
Didn't even get to eat.waited to be helped no one would seat us.After 5 min someone finally told us it would be 15 min before they could seat us then made us put our name on a waiting list after people who had just come in were put on the waiting list before us.

"If I could give The Cottage 10 stars, I would! This is one place in Queen Creek that I continue to be impressed by. The staff is out of this world, and the quaint little cottage is one of those places that you just *have* to stop by and visit from time to time.\n\nFor my daughter's birthday, we stopped in and got her a few little trinkets for her fairy garden. She asks to go back at least once a week! Though, I will say, this is not a place you should take little ones because they will just get into everything and make you a nervous wreck. As long as they're at the age where they can look without touching, it's fine.\n\nI ordered flowers for my wife for our anniversary, and even though I had no idea what type of bouquet to get, The Cottage staff put together the PERFECT flower arrangement! We were both very impressed. Plus, they got me major brownie points with the wife so... FIVE STARS FOR SURE. ;)\n\nOur flower arrangements always last a good week or two, they're always super fresh, and just absolutely gorgeous. Next time I order some, I'll take a photo and update!\n\nTip: There isn't much parking around back, and it's a beast to get in and out of, so park on the street if you can.",4
"I'm an existing patient. Granted, I haven't been to the doctor in three years. I didn't need to. I've had two kids in three years and during this period, my OB acted as my primary. In any case, I called to make an appt with Dr Sparks in order to get a check-up and get some blood work done. I was told that I could make an appt (15 min slot) to meet and discuss what I would need but the next appt I could get would not be for six weeks. WTF! I don't recall any of my visits taking more than 15 mins. So why would I schedule an appt to discuss things that need to be done when in that 15 mins, all those things can be done. Looks like I need a new doctor. One that thinks more of patient care instead of how to bill insurance for an extra visit that involves no care. \n\nIt's a shame. She used to be a good doctor.",0

"Oh Bamboo Club...what happened????  We haven't been there in about three years, but it used to be our absolute favorite. The orange chicken USED TO BE crispy and sticky with orange slices...really, just divine. Now, it's like you'd get at any Chinese restaurant. Just chicken with sauce thrown on it. So average and SOOOO disappointing.  (Why do restaurants insist on changing the recipe for their signature dishes? Is it to save money? So short-sided and just not very smart).  The service was just weird - the server said he'd been there 14 years, but we'd never seen him before. He talked a mile a minute and it seemed like he'd sucked some helium before coming to our table. Seriously, we could barely understand him and he kind of creeped us out.\n\nOtherwise, the food was good (not memorable). The crispy spinach is still great. But it used to be THE PLACE to go. Now, it just seems like any other restaurant. And it's starting too look a little worn down.  Next time we're in S'dale, we'll pass.  Sorry to see ya go, B.C.",1
I grew up in Las Vegas and when I was younger I use to come here all the time.  I try to go as often as I can when I visit home.\n\nThe turkey on sourdough is amazing with a vanilla cream italian soda.\n\nThis place is fresh and delicious!,4
"Food was good but service rather slow as the bartender was the only person covering the restaurant. He was a nice guy, just shouldn't of had to carry the load.",1
This isn't my usual Capriotti's location but I was driving by and decided to stop.  I ordered my usual turkey sandwich with extra pickles.  The guys working here were very friendly.  I recommend this place to anyone.,4
"Pretty interesting place, which has different tasting pancakes. The red velvet was whatevers, but the carrot cake was very unique and pretty good. I opted for the adobo fried rice omelet. It's not that bad.",2
"i think it's hard for most places to really shine in the holiday season.  there are loads of set menus and a huge amount of diners arriving in very large parties meaning that a restuarant can find its kitchen overwhelmed with multiple orders at the same time and unhappy people waiting a very long time for food and drink.  with that in mind, i didn't have high expectations for my first visit to Jeremiah's Taproom as a large group of us were going for hogmany dinner and drinks.\n\nwe arrived a bit early, but the waitress assured us the table would be ready in five minutes, which is pretty much was.  we were seated through in the small backroom area since our party was so largre this was the only way to get 15 people round one table.  the room was nice though and i appreciated the fact that it was a wee bit quieter than the front bar making it easier to talk.  the table though was in an L shape which made it a bit awkward for people to get out when needing to get more drinks.\n\nalthough we booked dinner for 7:30pm and arrived on time and were seated, our meals didn't actually start arriving until well past 8:30pm.  i was a bit annoyed as i was starving and 3 glasses of prosecco into the night, but i did appreciate that this place has a small kitchen and it appeared only one waitress.  that said when our starters did arrive my smoked salmon with soda bread looked pretty tasty and was devoured quickly!  sadly that meant a rather lengthy wait for the main to arrive which for me was the venison burger with skinny fries.  when the burger did arrive i was well pleased with my choice and really enjoyed it!  the burger itself was juicy and had a nice covering of blue cheese to give a tangy taste mixed with the sweetness of the mulled plums.  there was loads of fries so many i couldn't finish them and i had to take the burger out of the bun as there was just a bit too much bread.\n\ndessert was really the only let down as yet again it was another long wait and when my cheeseboard finally did arrive i was a bit shocked that one of the cheeses was a fairly large scoopy of philadelphia cream cheese... a bit cheap, but the other two cheeses a blue cheese and i think a cheddar were good although i found the digestive biscuits served with them a bit dry and too sweet to be eaten with cheese.\n\noverall, minus the slow service due to such a busy night for this bar, i found my dinner really quite nice.  drinks were good as well and not too pricey (possibly a \u00a31 less than what you'd pay in the centre of town).  so i will definitely go back here to try things out on a normal night and hope that the service improves as the food is tasty and i would definitely go back to try another burger.",3
"Annoying and inconsistent. Came in on a Monday evening to put in a request for my daughters birthday party on Saturday, baker wasn't available so I left all my info to be contacted. Was told that they only needed 2  days notification. Didn't get a call from bakery until Wed. Went back in and put in our request and was told they weren't able to do it. What a waste of time and energy.",0
"This place is good, but very ordnary, nothing special, nothing stands out about it, they use pace salsa!!! The service was ok, but 2 min after we got out meal, the waiter asked if everything was ok, and dropped our check!!! I thought this was very tacky, he was not busy, and we were being rushed out!! We will not be going back, what's the point.. We can get as good, and alot better food, with better service elsewhere",1
"Would give this place 3.5 stars...The place is chill. $28 bones per person. If your 48\"" and above it's full price. Come early to get a spot under an umbrella. Give or take 30 umbrellas. Your other alternatives are the general seating areas but it's not close to the water attractions. It's more like picnic tables. Parking is free and close to the entrance which may give you an option to bring snacks and eat at the parking area. There were a significant amount of people who brought coolers staked out an grass area and chowed down. Your wrist band allows re-entry. You can grab a BBQ combo which includes a beverage for $10-12 bones inside. Most of the visitors migrate to the wave pool. A wave every 3-5 minutes. Rafts or body boards are available for $5 with a refundable $1. You may bring your own board. They will also allow specific time for individuals with body boards (others wait outside the wave pool). Lockers are $7. The slides are okay nothing spectacular and the majority are enclosed tubes. Pick up a tube/raft below the ride, hall it up, hop on, and down you go. There are double tubes if you want to double up on the ride. The place are manage by young adults but these young lifeguards will definitely put you in your place if your unsafe in the water. I commend them for that! Overall, not crowded for a weekend holiday. Great place to spend a few hours if that's your goal (gets redundant after a few hours). Close to Tempe and doable from Scottsdale. Would come again to kill a few hours and get your fix.",2
Horrible service. We arrived for my mother's day belated dinner. No one greeted us for about 10 minutes in the lobby we waited. Then we were seated. No drinks were served until the waitress came by 20 minutes later. Waitress suggested a diff entr\u00e9e then I wanted. Food was gross/disgusting.  It was my first time there and experiencing indian food. No valued service towards the customers. She got no tip..sorry. bad service/gross food=no tip in my book!,0
I'm sorry I can not give an accurate review of the food. The filth after just stepping a few inches inside the door was so overwhelming I had to leave immediately. I have been here many years before and never remember it being this bad. But this was bad! The menus were sticky and dirty. Everything was old and filthy. I can usually eat at most any dive but this was assaulting!  Pink pepper! You are in serious need of an overhaul.,0
Finding authentic Pakistani food was almost impossible despite a large community and so called Pakistani restaurant called copper kettle. This restaurant serves chicken karahi which is actually tasty. The nans are freshly baked and are a delight. The restaurant itself is about the size of walk in closet and can only seat eight people. I would only recommend it for take out food. The owner is very courteous.,3
"Unless you've been here before, let me warn you about the \""unspoken house rules\"": \n\n1. Order first (do not try and sit down).\n2. Wait for your food while standing.\n3. Find a seat (if one is available).\n\nUnder no circumstances should you sit down before placing an order. And if the place is full, don't try and sit down without food in your hands, unless you want to be made an example of.\n\nMy wife and I (who frequent restaurants several times a week) have never experienced anyone quite as rude as the woman behind the counter at this place.  We had never been here before and when we walked in, my wife sat down at a table and I went up to place our order.\n\nLittle did I know the house rules (see above) and after the people in front of me ordered, the obnoxious cashier pointed to our table and to another table (of newbies) and said to the person who just placed the order: \""you can either sit there or there\"", with the tact of, say, General Patton. She never asked us to get up or explained the \""unwritten rules\"" to us.  An \""excuse me, but you need to order first before you sit down\"" would have sufficed.\n\nSo, my wife got up and we walked out of this place. The food could very well be good - but with waitstaff like this woman - there are plentty of other places around town with not-so crummy service that I'd prefer to spend my money.",0
Really disappointed... Used to go here once a week for lunch. Pizza was soggy the chipotle pasta use to be my favorite they changed it from rigatoni to elbow pasta and totally changed the sauce. It is no longer cheesy and creamy. It had little to no flavor. The only reason I gave it 2 stars bc the Italian chopped salad was good even though less toppings then in the past,1
"Ooppsy! colour me embarrassed, it seems that the cafe I meant to yelp is actually called the social club and is one block over but looks the same.\nI guess I never knew the name and assumed that the one that showed up here under Social club st viateur was the only one but..,  it' s not the same.\n\nI have tried both and the main difference is that the Olimpico, is mostly just coffee and they don't have those scrumptious sandwiches, I will be heading up there tomorrow and should be able to sort it all out.....to be contiued da da da",1

Well, that's not the only reason we come to Vegas, but once I got wind of this place and its reputation I knew what I had to do.\n\nI wasn't disappointed...this is the real thing and is pretty good. I also didn't experience any sketchiness when I rolled in around 2pm on a Tuesday. That doesn't mean you shouldn't be a little careful, but know that you might be lucky and not catch any of the pimp-slapping-his-ho action many of these other reviewers have mentioned.",3
"Probably one of the worst all-around experiences I've had in a while. Came here a few Sundays ago\n\nMistake #1\nOur waitress either:\na) hates her job.\nb) hates life in general.\nc) Both.\nI have no idea why this girl would be hired in the first place. The only words that were exchanged between her and uswere \""What are you having\"" and \""Here\"".  And to be honest, the way she was with her other customers, we were treated the best. She didn't crack a smile- she didn't even look at us. She just seemed as though she was miserable and did not want to be there.\n\nMistake #2\nOut of pancakes by 9 am on a Saturday????!!!!!\nLuckily, my husband must have ordered the very last one but we heard her tell the people sat behind us - \""We are out of pancakes\"". There wasn't a \""I'm sorry we are out of pancakes\"" or \""We don't have pancakes now but we will in 20 minutes\"" -- it was just a cold, matter-of-fact, unapologetic \""We are out of pancakes\"".  \n\nMistake #3\nThe food presentation. My Chicken Fried Steak was so-so, but I must mention that the picture posted here does not look  ANYTHING like what  was handed to me. My hubby ordered chicken and waffles.. when he got his order he got a plate of 2 chicken fingers & ranch placed next a plate of a waffle. The expectation of the order was Chicken and waffles but it seemed like it was 2 separate orders. Plus it took over 7 minutes (i counted) for her to put syrup on the table. And despite getting the last order of pancakes ---- they were cold.... cold enough that the huge glob of butter that they put on top didn't even melt at all.\n\nSo why two stars instead of 1? The food was okay. The expectations were high because of the reviews, but all in all, the food (other than the cold pancakes) was standard. I'd like to think that this breakfast place has potential to be better if they hire better servers and order more pancake mix.... but until then, I'm sticking to Mr. Mama's - it's just down the street from here.",1
"I have been eagerly anticipating trying this new restaurant, as it is open late, at Aria, and I am a big fan of the Mexican restaurants at MGM properties (e.g. Diego, Border Grill) so I had high expectations.\n\nThe decor is similar to Lemongrass, with suspended rope effects and lots of wood. The dim atmosphere is very appealing, I prefer dark to light in a restaurant. The skull-themed chainsaw wood carvings on the East wall are a fantastic touch.\n\nAnd the food? Some of the best fresh tortilla chips I've ever had, thin but not too thin. Perfect house salsa, again thin but not too thin, medium-ish spice. Amazingly, you can polish off this entire basket (it's inevitable) and not feel like you've ruined your appetite. As with other MGM Mexican spots, ask for the secret Habanero Salsa - the one at Javier's is cooked with a hint of butter, served warm and comes out orange.\n\nGuacamole ($10) - a generous portion, and I prefer Javier's kitchen-made guac to others' tableside versions.\nCabo Azul ($28) - Lobster Enchilada, Chile Relleno w/Dungeness Crab and Shrimp, Bonus Ensenada-style Shrimp Taco, Black Bean dip and Rice. Recommended by our server. Delicious and almost overwhelming in terms of deciding where to start and planning my last bite. A fun mini-buffet of Mexican-style seafood. A winner.\nGot to taste the Chicken Picado ($22) as well - very tasty char-broiled chicken flavor.\n\nCesar, our server, was friendly and made some great menu suggestions. All of the server assistants did a superb job at keeping our drinks and chips topped off.\n\nExcited to try the rest of the menu. LOTS of appealing items on it. It would be easy for me to proclaim that this food is 'overpriced' and give it 4 stars instead of 5, but I think if you choose to eat here you know exactly what you're getting into. If you want 'cheap' Mexican food you probably know exactly where to get it.

"My realtor, Caralee Kecman, recommended Steve Kelly to me a couple months ago and I've used him twice (so far). He did my spare-bedroom flooring installation in April and did some desert landscaping (dig out old rocks and add new) for me today.

I plan on having him build a closet in my spare bedroom and replace my sink next. \n\nHe also gives good advice when asked and provides tips on how to do it yourself (if applicable), a refreshing change from other contractors. \n\nIt's hard to find a good handyman in Las Vegas but you don't have that excuse anymore.

"I visited Belk this past weekend and was not pleased with my experience. \n\nFirst of all I wanted to buy my mother some makeup for her birthday from the Estee Lauder counter. Both of the saleswomen were busy, so I waited a while and then swung by again. One of the women finally spoke to me, but didn't seem to understand my question (pretty simple- if I purchased the wrong shade, could my mother exchange it later for the right shade). She told me, \""find out the color and come back\"". \n\nNext I stopped by the shoe department. They were having a good sale and were quite busy. One thing really put me off- there were no boxes of \""footie\"" hose to be found anywhere! Sorry, but I don't want to buy a pair of shoes (even at a discount) if I don't feel comfortable trying them on. Footies are offered both for hygienic reasons and also so you can tell if shoes will fit properly when you're wearing hose- IMO they are not an \""optional\"" offering for a shoe department! Also, salespeople were in really short supply considering they were having this big sale- nobody ever offered to help us at all! \n\nAfter that I went to the fine jewelry counter, looking for a graduation gift for my future-SIL. I was well pleased with the selection and the prices, but even though I told the saleswoman that I was buying a gift, she rang the earrings/necklace up so that I didn't get a gift receipt. When I reminded her, she told me it was \""too late\"" and that if I wanted to wait, she could have a manager come over, void the sale, and re-ring it so that I could have a gift receipt. I opted to wait, the manager came to void the sale, and she started ringing it up again. Unfortunately, she did it wrong AGAIN and I was still left with a normal receipt with the prices on it, NOT a gift receipt. She told me I could either wait for a manager again, or I could use \""liquid paper\"" to white out the prices on my regular receipt. Her excuse was that she \""didn't do a lot of gift receipts in fine jewelry\""- so what?! \n\nI went back by the Estee Lauder counter and again the saleswoman was not helpful so I burned a few minutes trying on blue jeans. I found a pair I wanted to buy, but unfortunately they had been put on a 30% off shelf when they weren't actually on sale so I skipped that too. \n\nFinally I met up with my mom and we visited the Estee Lauder counter together. Surprise, surprise- the saleswomen not only had time for her, but offered her mini \""samples\"" of two different colors of her foundation, and the promise that if she pre-ordered one color and decided she liked the other color better, she could swap it when she came in to pick it up. \n\nI'm not impressed with this Belk at all but apparently you will like it more if you appear to be a well-to-do woman in your 50's rather than a woman in your 20's with a kid in tow. Boooo.",1
"We went to Brunswick Zone in Mesa for their breakfast & bowling special. For $10, I would say it was alright, nothing special about the bowling alley itself and the breakfast was about what you'd expect. There were three options to choose from for breakfast - pancakes with bacon, french toast with bacon, & eggs and toast with bacon. As a result of all the bacon that was being cooked in their kitchen, the whole place smelled like bacon. I'd be willing to come back to this place at another time.",2
"The T-C-T Toasted Cheeses Torte with green chills was awesome.   We have been going to Macayo's for five decades and the salsa and T-C-T's have been a favorite for years.

"We are questing for decent dog parks close to home and decided to check this one out.  We had been to Sahuaro Ranch Park for a party at one of the ramadas.  The park is pretty nice, so we figured we would try the section for pooches.\n\nBest to access this park off 63rd Avenue.  There's a parking lot right by the entrance, which is always nice when you have a crazed beast or two looking to get inside to romp with new friends.  One of my boys weighs 90 lbs and the other weighs 25 but things he weighs 75, so we checked out the big dog side, where we found everyone from a Pomeranian to a Great Dane.  \n\nThere are a few benches scattered around the park and agility pieces are set up along the west and north sides of the big dog enclosure.  The little one seems to have them scattered throughout.  We were there at night, but there are trees, so I'm guessing shade.\n\nMy only complaint was not with the park, but as usual, the people.  Little kids running loose and grabbing at dogs; such a recipe for disaster.  Thankfully, my dogs like (or at least tolerate) kids.  I only know this because of the numerous times we've gone to DOG parks and encountered little kids.  \n\nThat wasn't the reason for our early departure though.  That would have been the gentleman who arrived with two dogs, one of them a female in heat.  I know the dog was in heat because the woman who was not watching her small children was busy talking to this guy about the dog birds-and-bees while the poor girl dog was running around the park with a pack of male dogs right on her tail.  Dog in heat + dog sausage fest = bad news.",3

The fruit-based salsas are nice.  There is a the sweet green chili sauce they do that is nice, but probably high in sugar for an entree.  If you get a drink, you might easily drop $10.

"I was really excited to have my hardwood floors cleaned. Darnell and two other guys came by and gave me a quote and it was very fair and I was excited to see my hardwood floors shine. I made the appointment and assumed Darnell would be doing the job but two other guys showed up which was fine by me as long as the job got done. When they were almost done I saw a huge scratch that they had made when they moved one of our chairs. They weren't going to fix it until I spoke up and mentioned it. Next the kitchen area that has the most traffic had some pretty bad spots that Darnell showed us would come up or at least be less noticeable which I was super excited about. When the guys were about done I looked in the kitchen and noticed none of the bad spots that Darnell had said he would spend extra time on were even the tiniest bit lighter. I asked the guys to go over it again and the spots came up so it seems like it was just pure laziness that they didn't want to put in the extra effort (it only took about 15 extra min of their time) If I wouldn't have asked those spots and the huge scuff mark from them would still be there. Once they left I started to notice corners and other parts of the floor have dust and haven't even been wiped down, I understand not being able to get the buffer in those spaces but not even wiping it?! The floors look decent now but I don't think I would be using them again unless it was guaranteed that Darnell would be doing the job. He was very detailed and you could tell really wanted to do a great job I can't say the same for the guys the showed up today.",0

"It's tucked away, but worth the search. The decor is very fun. The plastic covers on the booths are what you would expect to find in a Hispanic grandma's house. The chips and salsa are some of the best I've had. The first time we went, the hubs and I tried a bit of everything: nearly every taco and a torta. The most recent visit, we grabbed a taco and split a pork belly torta. If it's a first time, you gotta try the pork belly empanadas and chicken tinga. The table taps are really cool and, if I hadn't had my 3 mo old son with me, I would have had a beer. The only downside were the churros. The sauces were great and would have complimented the churros perfectly had the churros been cooked all the way through.

"Located in the Casino level of the Southpoint, this buffet is priced right for what you get.  It has Chinese, Mexican, and Italian sections, as well as a salad bar, other more \""American\"" stuff, and soups (during lunch and dinner).  At breakfast, obviously, the offerings are different.  But I can't imagine coming into this place with a hankering for a certain taste and not finding it.  There is plenty of protein and even a Mongolian BBQ grill.  We didn't try it but it looked intriguing.\n\nBefore paying and going in, get a club card and a coupon book.  It's free.  In the book, you'll find a coupon for free lunch and breakfast M-F. Each coupon is good for two people so if you and your partner sign up, you'll have more than one free meal if you're there during the week.\n\nThe front-end is a bit chaotic, with employees at the top of the line yelling over a wireless communication system, for other people deep within the dining room to locate appropriate tables.  It seems, no matter what time of day you arrive, you'll stand in line.  I'm not sure why... often the restaurant isn't full.  Go by early morning on New Year's Day.  80% empty and still a line.  That is a testimony to the inefficiency of their table assignment methodology.\n\nOur service varied.  The first time we went there, we had to beg the guy for drink refills.  The second time, the lady was right on it.  In fact, she simply brought us a pitcher of iced tea for our table.  What a concept.\n\nIt's hard to recommend specific dishes, seeing as how they vary the selections from day to day.  I did enjoy the clam chowder.  It was quite savory, with plenty of clams.  You can get good-sized tail-on shrimp in the Chinese section and put it over a salad for a nice shrimp salad.  They also have a good taco bar.  I broke the taco shells and made a tostada out of the meat, beans, cheese, lettuce, pico de gallo, and corn (from the salad bar).  The taco meat was really good.  They also had tortilla chips and guacamole.  Both were pretty good.\n\nI'll never understand why people bring stroller-aged children to Las Vegas.  Seems the smoke inhalation alone would kill them.  But, no, I see people cruising the casinos with kids screaming in strollers.  Hey, I'd scream too.  And I felt like it when a large family with one screamer couldn't shut her up.  Makes me feel like I'm waiting at the DMV when actually I'm just trying to enjoy my breakfast.  So one would think with the complex seating assignments, they'd come up with a way to put people like that in a padded room or something.  Sigh.\n\nOh, and then there is the element of society that goes in there to steal food.  Unbelievable, one little old lady in a double-knit suit boldly went up to the pastry area and put a stack of at least 10 bear claws on her plate and took them back to her table.  5 minutes later all were gone but her giant purse sure was fatter.  She repeated this several times while we were having our breakfast.  Isn't anybody in there watching for that kind of nonsense?  If my college aged son tried that, he'd probably get booted out by Security within minutes.  Reverse age discrimination.  Let the cheapies get away with whatever, subsidized by the ones who play by the rules.  It's a turn-off and makes it look like the hotel / restaurant could care less.",2
Good authentic mexican food in the heart of old town. The Santos building next to patio is pretty cool too.,2
Awesome little Gem in a quiet neighborhood\nFriendly and welcoming service! Will be back soon!\n*try the brisket and beans!,4
Great location lots of fun!,3
I am 5 starring this based on DRINKS ONLY. I stopped in while waiting for my boyfriend to get off work to grab a martini. It's valentines day and it was super busy but the bartender was quick to take my order and quick to get my drink! I had a raspberry lemon drop martini and it was ama-za-zing! Bartender was super funny too! Good times!,4
Jeff and staff have this place dialed in.  Nice simple tap room with awesome beer (both their own and guest taps). Don't change a thing.,4
"Well, there were some good points and some not so good.  I gave it a 2 because the whole description is what it felt like-Meh.\n\nI had heard some good things about Match.  Reviews from actual food critics. (whom I am not sure I trust so much right now).  So I might have had kinda high expectations going in.  It was a Tues. night, 9pm and we were the only diners.  Not the best sign.  We started with cocktails.  I ordered a Suspicious Minds-a ginger version of the cosmopolitan and it was drinkable although a bit dry.  My husband ordered the Aloha (something) which was made with pineapple flavored vodka.  Think artificial pineapple candy flavored with rubbing alcohol.  Not very good.  He could barely finish it and went for the Kiwi Caipiroska..due to actual muddled fruit, it was sour but better than his previous drink.  I wouldn't even suggest a cocktail menu any more if you aren't going to use real fruit, real juice, and infused rather than flavored alcohols.\n\nI like that each food item has the country of origin printed next to it.  Kind of makes you feel like you are eating around the world.  They are open until 2am and that is a great idea for our side of town too.  I guess when you are drunk the blandness of the food would be a good thing.\n\n\nThe prices are very reasonable (not like SOME places in town) so we felt comfortable to get quite a variety of small plates. We started with the Sashimi Salad, Salt and Pepper Calamari, Belgium Frites, Dragon Balls, Tuna Poke and usually we would order more.  Well, here's why we didn't. \n\nThe Sashimi Salad had a decent amount of little pieces of sashimi and for the price I think it was justifiable.  There was way too much vinegar-ey dressing on way too little greens.  And the greens weren't really green but that horrible industrial iceberg lettuce mix a Walmart shopper adores.  Greens are so inexpensive they could at least have given us a large portion to absorb all that vinegar.\n\nThe Salt & Pepper Calamari was missing the salt and pepper.  We actually really tried to find the pepper..maybe it was white pepper? But couldn't see any or taste it either.  I have had this dish many times and usually you can actually taste the Salt and Pepper.  The panko style breading was a good crispyness, the calamari a bit too chewy (it kept snapping back at me!) but it had about NO flavor.\n\nThe Belgium Frites could have been Ore Ida.  I had these in San Francisco and I wouldn't be surprised if these were frozen from the bag and barely fried.  No salt to distract me here either.  The sauce Andolouse (?) was supposed to be spicy and was about as flavorful as your basic mayo.\n\nThen the Dragon Balls.  We have had these types of creations at some sushi bars so we KNOW that you CAN deep fry sushi and still have it be moist inside.  These were not. They were fried so much on the outside they should be called Dragon Cannon Balls..and the spicy tuna inside was cooked so much that it didn't have any more flavor.\n\nLast but not least we tried the Tuna Poke..I guess it can be considered authentic because there was Tuna and sesame oil..but since tuna is so light in flavor, that much sesame oil can be over powering.  I love sesame oil but really, a dish of it isn't that appealing.\n\nBeing the food adventurers we are we were going to try dessert anyway.  And here comes the best part of the meal.  We ordered the Hawaiian dessert which was like a biscuit dough deep fried and rolled in sugar.  The doughy balls had a lovely browned crispy outside with a tender light biscuit consistency inside.  Served warm, the sugar covering the dough was moist and perfect.\n\nWe also ordered the Frozen Coconut.  This is a great coconut sorbet, not too sweet with a creamy (not like ice cream) texture.  Served inside a halved coconut shell it was the perfect ending to a less than perfect meal.",1
"We had a groupon, which made this place even better. The food was excellent. I had the poutine which sounds terrible but was as good as everyone on Yelps says it is. I had it for my main course and it's so rich it was very filling. My husband had the burger and it was great also. We topped it off with a piece of chocolate for dessert. My husband loved it but I thought it was too sweet and I didn't think the bacon crisp went with it at all. (I've had chocolate and bacon combos before that were much better.)\n\nThe only problem was the attitude of our server...he never cracked a smile the whole time. He was either a snob or in a bad mood. On the otherhand, our bus guy filling the waters and removing our plates was super friendly. I wanted to tip him instead!",3
"First impressions can be deceptive and on first impressions this just appears to look like any usual charity shop with your usual distribution of clothes, book and bric-a-brac, but the stuff on offer here is usually a cut above the rest and of higher quality than you might expect.\n\nYou rarely see any low end items in here and despite being relatively small, this place is usually worth a look in on your way past, because they limit themselves to only putting out the better donations and passing the other ones down the chain.\n\nAlthough most of the sections are roughly equal in quality and importance my personal favourite is the books section which should cater for all interests.  Indeed I have managed to pick up in the past Gazza for \u00a31 and Bleak House for \u00a31.50 and not only you can you not argue with that value, but those are hardly books of the same genre.",3
"I came here with a good friend of mine for restaurant week and I am so happy we got a last minute reservation on a Friday night. It was AMAZING!! We loved every minute of it. The decor and the ambiance of the restaurant was great. It would be perfect for a date night. We sat in front of the kitchen and it wasn't loud or distracting at all. Our server, Emily was great. She gave us suggestions on the wine and wasn't too overwhelming checking in on us. \n\nWe each got different meals which was good because we got to try each other's and let me tell you, nothing was a disappointment. The meal came with a glass of wine (PLUS!) I ordered the mussels-they were decent..a good amount for one person, she got the roasted beet salad. For our entrees I ordered the grilled hanger steak and it was cooked perfectly. It came on top of a bed of saffron risotto. It was good, but a bit too salty for me, which was fine because I could give the leftovers to my salt-loving boyfriend. My friend got the smoked chicken florentine which came with spinach gnocchi and sundried tomatoes. It was delicious. For dessert I got the chocolate lasagna (pretty much a chocolate torte) and she got the blackberry shortcake. It was superb. \n\nI will definitely be back to visit this place, the servers were sweet, there wasn't a wait, and the food was great.",4
"It is important to point out that Blue Adobe Grill is not a Mexican restaurant, it is a New Mexican restaurant. While that may seem to be an unnecessary clarification, it is actually fairly important to keep in mind as you visit. \n\nFor a New Mexican joint, it is pretty dang good and true to the region, but food a sit-down Mexican joint it would be disappointing. In order to maintain full disclosure, it has been a couple of years since I went here last, but it has been around for years so I can't imagine much has changed. Overall I would recommend it to people who don't have expectations of a certain type of food. It's good but nothing memorable.",2
"The exhibit they have was good but it was like walking through a reader's digest condensed version.  In one room they take you from dinosaurs through showgirls.  The dinosaurs take up the majority of space which leaves the modern age with a lot of info to be crammed into a small space.  I loved the beginning of the casino era info with Howard Hughes, old showgirl costumes, and info on the early casinos but was surprised at the lack of modern exhibits.  Also would have liked to see more on the founding of Nevada, building of the dam, and mob years.\n\nThe changing exhibit was sparse but interesting.",2
"After wandering around the area trying to find something to eat, we happened upon KGB.  Overall, the experience was just okay.  I had the Southwest Burger, which was actually pretty tasty.  I also ordered the tator tots instead of the fries and aside from the fact that they were originally frozen, they were pretty good as well.  My husband, on the other hand, was not as impressed.  He ordered the Orchard turkey burger and the meat itself was a previously frozen patty.  Not sure how a place claiming to be \""gourmet\"" can serve frozen food.  It's also pretty pricey.  So, if you're craving a burger, are in the area, and don't mind spending $15 for a burger that you may or may not consider gourmet, check it out.",2
"Myself and a friend were in Vegas  2/12/12 through 2/16/12. On Tuesday the 14th we decided to have breakfast at Serendipity. I had the eggs benedict which was fantastic. Everything went as it should for that visit and left me thinking that I would like to come back before we leave town.\nOn Thursday the 16th we went back to Serendipity to have breakfast. From the start this visit was less than acceptable. Upon our arrival the hostess and another female employee were talking at the hostess counter. We walked in and I said good morning after it was apparent that they were going to finish their conversation before greeting or seating us. Once we got seated it was near ten (10) min. before the waiter Kevin made his way to our table. He appeared to be professional on the surface. He took our drink orders and went to get them. I had coffee and my friend had water. Another five (5) min. passed then he returned with our drinks. At this point we realized that service was not going to be his strong point, so we made sure that we were ready to order. The wait for our food was well within the acceptable time period. After drinking my first cup of coffee while eating my breakfast I began watching for Kevin to ask for more coffee. After more than five (5) min. I stopped another female waitress and asked her for more coffee. She was happy to get more coffee for me and did so fairly quickly. Unfortunately there were a lot of coffee grounds in the coffee and dribbled on the table as well. Several min. passed then I finally saw Kevin and stopped him to ask for another cup due to the grounds issue. From that point forward the visit was unacceptable!!!!! Upon expressing my dissatisfaction over the service and the coffee grounds in the coffee, Kevin rather than being apologetic decided to cop an attitude about it. I am a business owner and would not tolerate this type of behavior out of an employee of mine. Long and short of this is that all Kevin had to do is apologize for the lack of timely service and get the coffee. end of story!!! After the complete bomb dropped by Kevin another male employee came out and stopped at our table and looked at me as if to say oh you are the one Kevin had a issue with..\nAll that said I still gave the restaurant three out of five stars because of the food quality and the service that I received on my first visit.\n\nOne last note the table beside up waited much much much longer for service form Kevin and were noticeable irritated as well.",2
"Wow, just wow! Love the concept of an all-you-can-eat Brazilian steakhouse. I recommend making reservations if you are planning to come here, but they won't seat you until your entire party is present. This place is great for groups. And I love the red light/green light system so no one is bothering you for more food when you're not ready and you stay seated for protein and a selection of sides. Just remember to turn over your card as needed. You only get up for the salad bar. The selection is okay. This is a great way to celebrate someone or spend time with family and friends with great food. And definitely come with a big appetite. A couple things though - there was one meat I was dying to have and even had to have a waitress call them over and they still never came. Eventually over time I became too full to have it when I was asked if I still wanted it. For the price, I'm not sure if I ate as much as it's worth so beware of that. Don't come here if you don't appreciate high quality, perfectly seasoned meat or if you're a picky eater. On a good note, they give complimentary full-sized dessert for birthdays if you tell your server. This place was really good but probably a one-time thing for me.",2
"This was our first stay at Treasure Island. The room was nice, bed comfy. Casino was nice not too large. Staff was great and they checked your room key before you can take the elevator to your rooms. Food was good and the two for one buffet coupons were awesome.",3
"It's always surprising to find edible Pho places outside of Chinatown, for that I have to give Lemongrass Cafe credit for. This place resides in the former 5 & Dine Cafe and it's pretty interesting how they turned a once upon a time great diner into a Vietnamese cafe. Some of the decor is still leftover from the previous owner plus a touch of Asian decor. \n\nI really enjoyed their Gi Xo\u00e0i (Green Mango Salad). It was light & refreshing and the tamarind sauce balanced out the flavors wonderfully. This salad consisted of shredded green mango, shrimp, pork, roasted peanuts and fresh herbs. I recommend this salad for those who don't mind the different taste and don't want something too heavy. \n\nOf course you can't have Vietnamese without ordering some pho, spring rolls and eggrolls. I thought both the spring rolls and eggrolls were good. The spring rolls could have used a little more flavor but the sauce made up for what the roll was missing.  I do think it's interesting that they do give you a couple options for different types of spring rolls and eggrolls.\n\nLast but not least, I decided to try the seafood clear noodle soup rather than the pho. I must say, this was the most interesting thing I had ever eaten. Those clear noodles were sticking to the back of my throat that I was trying not to choke on them. I've had these noodles in Korean dishes but for some reason they were really hard to swallow. The best way to describe this feelign is just picture taking a sticky hand and slapping it on the wall. The broth was ok but I probably wouldn't order this dish again. \n\nI would go to this place again to try their pho, banh mi and Kem Xo\u00e0i Tr\u00e1i Vi (mango ice cream)! Prices were reasonable and for 2 people who were pretty hungry, we paid around $40. Oh before I forget complimentary ice/hot jasmine tea is always a wonderful thing and the staff wasn't too bad. So if you don't want to take a trip to Chinatown, just take a quick trip to Eastern & 215 and you can have the same experience.",3
"You can find a better place. Over priced and they interrupt your \""relaxing\"" spa experience trying to sell you stuff. Kind of pathetic.",1
"HIGHLY RECOMMENDED: This is a great hidden gem.  Teharu is not your typical North Scottsdale frilly and fuss sushi bar.  It's low key and extremely easy on your wallet.  If you are looking for fancy, this is NOT the spot that will satisfy you.  If you are looking for inexpensive sushi, this is your spot.\n\nThey utilize a conveyor belt system to deliver fresh sushi throughout the restaurant.  We were not familiar with this method and by the time we had pulled a few items off the belt and finished them, we flagged down a waiter to find out how to keep track of what we had already eaten.  It turns out that the plates are color coded with each color representing a set price. Blue = $2.00, Green = $1.50 and Yellow = $1.00\n\nMy favorite item on yesterday's visit was the Haru Popper.  Essentially, it is a jalape\u00f1o popper filled with \""krab\"" and cream cheese. \n\nThe location is easy to get to.  Teharu is located on the north east corner of Frank Lloyd Wright Blvd at the 101 Freeway.  Parking can be sparse during lunch hours.\n\nEnjoy.",4
"I love this restaurant. Due to it's size, it's very cozy. The food is excellent and the service is terrific. It's not in the greatest location so I wonder about their longevity, but for a nice, romantic dinner, this is definitely one of our favorites. The scallops we had were to die for.",3
"Can you say overpriced? I avoid this place at all costs because in all my experiences, I have never felt welcome. The customer service has always been very bad and the staff has always pressured me (and my friends) to order something right away. I do not recommend this place to anyone. Although they serve good boba, it's not worth it. You can find better cafes in Vegas.",0
"Went on line finding a window tint place.  Had a great price ($100 which included the $25.00 discount) and they could get me in today.  Made the appointment on line and then spoke to a representative.  Once I got there found out that it would be a 5 hour job and that they couldn't do it today and that there would be an additional fee for removal of my existing tint.  First off the website said nothing of this additional charge, which may be standard practice but again no information on line or in speaking to the representative who knew I had existing to be removed.  Again once I got there I could tell that they didn't want my business.... didn't even attempt to  make it worth my wild.  Just said it may be $50 or more to remove and then tried to up sell to the two higher priced tinting options, and that it is time consuming and they are real busy...  So if they are so busy I guess the loss of one new customer isn't a big deal.",0
"$5.99 for Steak & Eggs after 12 am? Suuure, it sounds good.. but is it really? In my opinion, not so much.\n\nThis restaurant is located in a small, I'm guessing low-star hotel & casino. It's ambiance is like a small version of Marie Callender's and its food is like Norm's.\n\nThe bf and I both ordered the steak and eggs special and both of our orders came out LITERALLY 2 minutes after we put it in. Wow, 2 minutes to cook a medium well steak? If it sounds too good to be true, it's because it was! My steak was cold and both of our eggs were not fully cooked. It's pretty obvious here that they precook the steaks. But hey, I guess you have to cut a few corners when you're serving up food for that kind of price but try hiding it better!\n\nWhat can I say.. typical eggs, hash browns, toast, and under seasoned steak. Yes, its only $5.99 but you're in Vegas.. it's worth it to put in a couple more bucks for something worth eating!\n\nBLEH, never again.",1
Everything we ordered was delicious! Waitstaff was attentive and really cared that we liked our meals. Highly recommend the lemon grilled shrimp tacos! Yum!,4
"I have come here every time I've gone to Arizona. So when my grandma recommended we go here for authentic Mexican food and margarita's I was super stoked.\n\nSadly this place blew it on every level. When we came in we were told it was a 5 minute wait. Instead we waited 15 minutes. I didn't really care because I was hungry. We were finally sat down and I realized it was so hot in the restaurant that I started sweating.  But I was so excited for the food that I looked past this.\n\nFinally the waitress came. She recognized my grandma and remembered her order. And took it. So then it came my turn to order so I tried to order my food and drinks. The waitress literally told me that she would not take my food order. I was super confused because she took my alcohol order but wouldn't give me food. I ended up getting a jumbo margarita on the rocks. So when the drinks came out everyone else got their drinks except me. I told the manager he questioned my age and then tried to card me again. So I ended up getting carded twice for a drink that took me 15 minutes to get!\n\nWhile we were waiting for our drinks and food I realized it literally took 30 minutes for them to clear a table. I don't know if they were short staffed or just did not care but the restaurant was messy and the staff was super rude.\n\nBy this time I was starving, sweaty, and drunk before she even decided to take my order. This waitress what the rudest person I have ever met! I ended up ordering the enchiladas del mas. Which was a seafood enchilada. In the past they were amazing. But this time it took 30 minutes to get my food. The tortillas were stale and tasted like cardboard. The fish and seafood were rubbery and the only thing that was good was the refried beans and rice. Seriously though, how hard is refried beans and rice. You can't mess that up!!! \n\nBy the end of the night I was drunk, sweaty and hungry. his was possibly the worst service I have ever gotten in my life. I have never gotten disrespected so much in a place I was a patron.\n\nIf my family hadn't gotten good service here and good food and drinks I would have complained to the manager. But since I was the only one who had an inedible meal I just left. You could not pay me to come back here. And I'm making it a point to tell the people of yelp about the horrible service I received here. DO NOT COME HERE.",0
"I made the mistake of going here on a whim. Awful, shitty bland Mexican food. A waste of money and my butthole was angry with me.",0
"It's me and my bestfriends birthday! We wanna do a girls comp dinner somewhere... Bagatelle it is! \nIt's eight of us girls. We are seated at a round table and two of us decide to go to the bar to get some drinks. We asked if they still do the first round of drinks for free? He said Yes. So we got eight delicious shots and back to our table to down them. \nOur server delivered drinks to the other girls while we were gone and then I ordered a drink and he promptly delivered them. \nDinner service started... Bagatelle salad - pretty much giant lettuce leaves with some type of vinaigrette. Flank steak and salmon for entrees and mashed potatoes and hericot verts for sides. So there are eight of us girls, and for the flank steak and the salmon, there are four pieces each. So we all just split everything... This was my first time here for comp dinner but someone within our group had been here several times before and said the had always gotten A LOT more food than what we had just been served. It was all GOOD though, tasty, but I could have had more! We did have a vegetarian among us though and the chef did accommodate her and brought out a vegetarian risotto dish that was pretty freakin' good too! \nOh and of course I checked in on YELP and a check in offer popped up for a free glass of bubbly! I asked our server Martin about it and he said he would ask his manager. Griffin came over and I showed him the check in and asked him if he would honor that? I know we are getting a comp'd dinner, but it doesn't hurt to ask! He was very nice and said that was cool and then we all got a glass of the bubbles!\nFor dessert we had little tiny creme brulees. Not very much flavor involved, and I think they torched the tops of them a little too much but whatever - we scarfed those down. \nTime to check out with our server and head to Ellis Island....\nThe bill comes and it is $89. Apparently there was some misunderstanding about drinks... We had ordered those shots from the bar and I guess the bartender had transferred those over to our tab and then we had ordered a round of drinks but thought our server had said those were comp'd but only the shots got comp'd. It's not that we didn't want to pay for drinks or anything, it's just that when you think something is taken care of and then it ISN'T we're like WTF??? Not a big deal anyway, we paid and hooked our server up and then we on our merry little ways to... Ellis Island! \n\nWould I come back here? Yes, but either with less people or a better understanding of what and how much they are actually going to serve us!  The staff was all VERY nice and service was good and we had a lot of fun!",2
"I have been a fan of this restaurant for a couple of years and meet here frequently for business lunches and last night had a great dinner. The atmosphere is perfect for dining, relaxing, and having those long lingering conversations.\n\nI love Italian pasta dishes and am never disappointed in the dishes at Aiello's. My partner had her usual Caesar Salad, complete with Anchovies and egg-based dressing - I sampled it and of course it was outstanding. I usually have the Caesar with Salmon for lunch and suggest the same to my clients who are always surprised why they hadn't discovered this excellent restaurant before.\n\nAt dinner, the chef - owner, roams among the tables checking on your satisfaction. Invariably he comes around with a box and lets you pick a number between one and ninety. He then pulls out a numbered die that if it matches your number, he buys your dinner. I once saw him pick up the tab for a table of ten.",4
"Horrible, horrible, service.\nI went to Bar Louie's in Westgate, (Glendale), AZ and put my name down for a table for two.  The hostesses told us the wait would be about 20 minutes.  After our 25 minute wait, our pager buzzed, we went to the hostess booth, and they told us that \""they just told them they just started open seating, so we could look around and find an open table.\""  I looked around the restaurant and every table was taken.  I was so pissed I just said goodbye and went to a decent restaurant.  I couldn't believe that A) the hostesses were too lazy to look themselves around the restaurant for an open table for us -- which is their JOB that they actually get PAID for and B) they were basically telling us to f**k off.",0
"I've eaten at a lot of Thai places and this one is one of the best I've every been to!  The Nam Prik Ong was awesome and the drunken noodles with Prawns was amazing!  It's in the ghetto around the corner from where the old Sahara hotel was but well worth the drive off the strip to eat here!  In fact, one of our friends who lives in Vegas told us that there wasn't any good Thai places in Vegas.  We took him here and boy was he proved wrong!",4
"I totally thought of Kristen S. when I was here.  In true Oakland-style, I was searching for my post-drinking donut before heading off to bed.  Normally, Kristen and I would head to Colonial Donuts on Lakeshore for our last stop before bed (not the same bed, pervs!).  But I was in Vegas and Kristen couldn't make the trip, so I was missing home and my donut buddy.\n\nWhat is a girl to do?  FIX has warm donuts with dipping sauce on their dessert menu!  You don't have to tell me twice.  I was there!  More expensive than Colonial, but totally worth it.  Paired with a tawny port, it hit the spot.\n\nMaybe next time, Kris can go with me to FIX for our late night donut fix.",3
I was craving a good Italian style pizza & found it at Pino's! Roland was our waiter and he was great. Attentive even when busy. The Caprese salad was phenomenal and the calzone lived up to the reviews. Great find! Nothing fancy but great food.,3
"I'm always a fan of the breakfast sandwich.\n\nBut most fast-food places just don't do it for me.  They're always heavy in grease of the meat is funky or some roulette wheel of \""meh\"" that doesn't make the experience as satisfying as I hoped.\n\nBut Winchell's serves a really good ham, egg, cheese croissant.\n\nThey make it right there, and it's fresh and not \""weighty\"" in the stomach after you've eaten it.  The flavor is really good, and what started as a whim for a breakfast option has become a regular breakfast choice.\n\nNot that the namesake donuts aren't good, either.  These are good donuts, not all sugary sticky and messy.  They are light and the flavors are good.  It doesn't just taste like a ton of sugar on some dough.  The options I've tried have all been good, and enjoyable to wash down with milk.\n\nAs far as service goes for this location, the people are really nice here.  They seem all too willing to engage in conversation, and are polite, funny, and friendly.  I've never had a customer service issue in coming here.\n\nWhile chain restaurants don't really stand out all that much, this is a consistently pleasant and quality location.  The donuts are a step up, and while I haven't tried the other breakfast options, if the ham/egg/cheese combo is an indication, I'll have something to look forward to (once I break this particular food habit).\n\nAnd best of all, being 24 hours, the option for breakfast food is a given for anytime (always a plus), so my cravings are met whenever.\n\nDefinitely good stuff.",3
Beef tacos were very good (4-star). Guacamole was runny and had some rind/pit in it.  Other sides were just OK.,2
"I would consider myself a bit country, and enjoy a good country bar.  Although Toby Kieth's I love this Bar and Grill is a little mainstream, I would consider it my favorite.  I had a lot of expectations because of Toby's, none of which were met.\n\nI should have turned around and left when I got to the bar, ordered a Bud Light and a shot of Jack, and she laughed and said \""we don't like Bud Light here\"".  I told her I didn't care what she liked, and she said \""we don't have any Budweiser here\"".  HUGGGHHHHHHH?!?!\n\nI get beer contracts and distributorships, but not having Budweiser at a country bar??\n\nI grabbed my Coors Light, against my wishes, and took a walk.  I didn't find much that even came close to impressing me.  \n\nI found a tiny, and I MEAN TINY dance floor in the back which doubles as a main walkway to get in and out of the bathrooms.  \n\nThe main bar in the middle is packed and lacks proper staffing.  It's almost too big.\n\nThe crowd is the standard, typical Scottsdale crowd that don't know squat about country, that probably wondered over from one of the other trendy hotspots.  There were more affliction t-shirts and high heels than button ups and cowboy boots.  Even the bartenders could use a lesson in western/country attire.  I couldn't tell who was out of place, the bar or the people.\n\nThere was a DJ mixing today's country hits.  Yes, I said mixing.  It's Scottsdale, what do you expect?\n\nWe were there for a birthday and had a reserved table, which do have taps in which you can pour your own beer....pretty cool.  However a majority of the space on the sides of the bar was taken up by these VIP tables.  Not ideal, by any means.\n\nOverall I would never go back to this place.  I love Dierks and would have hoped he would have cared more about what he puts his name on, but the bar was packed and he obviously reaps the benefits of a full house.  Although the bar itself looked somewhat cool (if it were empty), it missed the whole country theme that Toby's has nailed.\n\nIf you want country (or Bud Light) stay far away.  Sorry Dierks.",0

"We like it here.  The two of us went in today for lunch and there was a short wait (15 minutes) so we decided to grab our drinks at the bar while we waited.  The Bartender was visually a bit flustered as there were three unsavory looking and sounding women seemingly trying his patience with their drinks and menu ordering.\n\nWhen her got to use I ordered a Cadillac Margarita on the Rocks in the Big glass and he got a tall Spotted Cow on tap.  I continued to be friendly to the Bartender as I know the type and he was tipped $3 for the drinks.  While we got down off our bar stools he did say 'thank you, enjoy your meals.'\n\nOur waitress was Tasha and she was very pleasant; we ordered the mozzarella sticks as an appetizer and chatted in between watching basketball and Men's gymnastics on one of their many TV's.   I ordered the bacon cheeseburger with the works (hold the cheese) and he ordered two (2) trios; one for now and one for later.\n\nThe food was good, but the fries were sparse and non-crispy while they were seasoned OK.  He had another Spotted Cow and we cashed out.\n\nAll in all another nice afternoon at Applebee's.",3
"Bouchon is a beautiful bistro, decked out in handsome dark wood decor and a buzzing atmosphere to match.  The service is fairly formal but friendly.  Dinner at Bouchon is a casual affair but rich with a vibrant Vegas feel and some excellent food.\n\nMy dinner at Bouchon was with my family of five, and we indulged in a manner befitting a meal in Sin City.  We started by ripping into the epic epi bread placed directly on our table along with good butter and a little jar of mustard.  The bread looked like a well-sprouted branch, and the little yeasted knobs that came off of it were delicious with a satisfying crust.\n\nWe ordered an array of appetizers and passed them around like a good Asian family.  The table favorite was the salmon rillettes, which were presented in a sealed mason jar opened at our table.  The rillettes were superb, with plenty of salmon character along with lots of fat and moisture.  We spread them on crunchy baguettes.  We also got the small assortment of shellfish, which came with a few varieties of oysters along with shrimp and lobster.  Everything was great - the oysters were fresh and briny, the shrimp sweet and snappy, and the lobster plump and meaty.  The assortment came with cocktail sauce, dijonnaise, and a shallot sauce, all of which were put to good use.  For something green, we ordered an heirloom tomato salad with pesto.  This was simple and lovely with bright, refreshing flavors and some gorgeous tomatoes.  The only appetizer I didn't especially care for was the escargot.  I don't mind eating snails, but these snails were a little bit boring.  They were served with little puff pastries and garlic butter, but somehow the result was unexciting.\n\nThe main courses were on the whole less impressive than the appetizers, but they were still very solid.  I ordered the braised beef short ribs special, which came with sweet carrots, potato confit, roasted bone marrow, and sauce bordelaise.  The beef was very good, tender and tasty, and I loved the softened carrots as well.  The bone marrow was fantastic smeared on everything, adding smooth velvet to each bite.  The sauce, though, was kind of overwhelming, deep but rather sweet.  The steak frites was a great, simple dish.  My brother ordered his steak medium and it was a nice even pink, with plenty of juice, and garlic butter on top.  The fries were spectacular, thin cut and crispy on the outside.  My other brother's croque madame and mom's mussels also came with these fries.  The croque madame was delicious but very decadent and hard to eat more than a couple bites of.  This was a fried egg and ham and cheese on toasted brioche, and would have been just right but for a smothering dose of mornay sauce.  The fried egg was a thing of beauty.  The mussels were the only item that I actively disliked.  The broth was fine but the mussels themselves tasted like that overwhelming garbage-like smell that mussels can sometimes have.  My dad's roasted chicken was a high point.  It was moist and juicy, served with caramelized figs, chanterelle mushrooms, pickled ramps, and chicken jus.\n\nFor dessert we split the vanilla creme brulee and the \""bouchon,\"" which was three little brownies with coconut sorbet, butter pecan, and peanut butter chip ice cream.  The creme brulee was decent, though fairly standard, with a pleasant crackly sugar crust.  The \""bouchon\"" was also straightforward but had a lot more sparkle.  The brownies were delicious, with a little bit of crumble but nice dark chocolate density.  The accompanying sorbet and ice creams were also great.\n\nWhen the meal was over, we were stuffed, with plenty of good food as well as a nice bottle of wine in our systems.  Overall I would say that I wasn't blown away by Bouchon, but I enjoyed our meal and might go back again.  The food wasn't fancy or innovative especially given the price point, but almost everything was precisely executed.  There's a Bouchon where I live and if I'm craving a classic bistro meal, I'll probably check it out.",3
This place is awesome! Staff is always friendly and food is always good! Wings are good and the crab puffs are amazing!,4
"I had the California tacos. The salsa was really good, but the tacos were sub-par. There are too many other good restaurants in the area to waste your time here.",1
"This was one of the best steak dinners I have had in a long time.  I knew we were off to a good start when Sommelier Lyndsey Whipple, suggested  a excellent bottle of 2005 at a price point well below what I initially expected.  I had a dry aged rib eye steak cooked to perfection along with a dish of mushrooms and shashito peppers, and of course French fries.  This cut experience exceeded my dinner at Cut in Los Angeles.",3
"People must like fishy fish tacos, because this place gets great reviews and a cool hangout, but every time I order fish tacos, they are very fishy. The plates and utensils are usually dirty, maybe is it part of NoDa style. I didn't enjoy myself. Sorry.",1
"This is a 2.5 star review.  They advertise as a fish and steakhouse.  Instead they should advertise as southern cooking.  Now I love southern cooking but there is more to southern cooking than deep fried and blackened.  \n\nPositives\nDecent selection of cocktails and food items (within the limitations of what I mentioned above).\nVery nice waitress.\n\nNegatives\nOf four of us that ordered steaks I was the only one who didn't have to return mine.  We are all prior military and have eaten some crappy food so to actually return something means it was really, really not what we ordered or very bad.\nHostess, sadly, was really clueless.\n\nIf only one of us had to return a dish I would have given them at least 3.5 stars.  My steak was good but we had a table of six people and only two were satisfied with their meal. One was mildly disappointed and three were bordering on pissed.",1
"Excellent, authentic and SO delicious! And vegetarian friendly too! \n\nThe ambience is awesome, its a great place sit outside on the patio. Although the place is really crowded, the service is excellent. The food arrives in time, and the waiters are really really friendly and accommodating. \n\nTry the veggie pizza with the peppers on it, that was our personal fav, we ended up ordering another one. \n\nIf you're in the mood for real authentic pizza, the type that doesn't make you feel bad when you're done, go for it!",4
"Whenever I crave Japanese style food that isn't sushi, this restaurant has satiated me each and every time.  From their katsu curry or tempura to their soba, ramen, udon, I have enjoyed each meal and what they've had to offer.  I will suggest though that if you do order the katsu curry, that you ask for the katsu to be served on the side so it doesn't lose the crispy quality of the panko that is otherwise buried in the curry sauce.  \n\nI don't know anyone who has tried their Italian fare, but my friends and I have found their Asian food selections to be delicious.  Their prices are pretty reasonable and I find their portions to be decent as well.  I have yet to personally try their sushi, but I have heard that it's also quite good.  \n\nI haven't had any issues with the service, but I also wouldn't say that they go above and beyond either - it is adequate.  The atmosphere is a little odd since it was, from what I heard, converted from a bakery to a restaurant, but it is clean and comfortable.  I do think it would be nice if they honed in on the Asian cuisine though, being named Cherry Blossom Cafe otherwise seems slightly misleading. (But now I'm just being nit-picky.)\n\nOverall, I have had rather positive experiences at this establishment and look forward to my next visit!",3
"The food is good and they have free WiFi.  That's about it on the positive side.\n\nThe service is pretty bad. I've been coming here for years and it's always been the same. They bring the plates for the table out one at a time, it isn't planned well.  Today I got my pad thai almost 15 minutes before the others at my table were served.\n\nThe spring rolls were frozen inside so I had to send them back.\n\nPerhaps my biggest complaint is the bathroom. It's gross.  Smells super funky all the time and is not clean. They have faux plants glued to the wall, trying to create an illusion of ambiance but instead, all I can think of is how the fake plants gather dust and gems and cannot be thoroughly cleaned.",1
UPDATE: I give it an A-OK for effort. I got a message from a Manager sincerely apologetic for my experience. I was offered a free sub and I figure the least I can do is give it a 4th try since the Manager made the effort.\nI do appreciate that.\nI will take a friend that hasn't been to Which Wich before and then we can both give it an honest review again.\nWish us luck!,2
"They have these on the Florida Turn Pike. They make excellent sandwiches at a good price, which I guess I hard to find in the day and age of fast food. But it's not that great.\n\n3 of 5 for just OK, bread and quality of the sandwich was very good.",2
"Ok so honestly the Park itself is beautiful. Its a fabulous hike, especially for anyone who is just starting to hike, or people who are trying to lose a few pounds. For more advanced hikers there are a few small mountains ( or big rocks is probably a better description)  that you can climb and have some fun. \n\nHere is the bad thing..trash, a lot of it and worse yet, a ton of broken glass! I was thankful I didnt bring a dog because I really would have been worried he would get cut. I mean there is a TON of broken glass all over the park! And if you have small children, well you may wanna skip this park. I really wanted to write a great review, a review with 5 stars....but I have never seen so much broken glass and trash on a hiking trail.....and I did the Appalachian Trail! I dont know if hikers just toss their glass bottles on the ground, if its homeless drinkers or why there is so much glass, but something needs to be done! Next time you go maybe pack some gloves and a trash bag and maybe we can get it cleaned up. But in the meantime you may wanna leave your dog and any small kids at home!",2
"I used to try to frequent this LVAC about 4x a week per my workout regimen, but now I feel like the consistency of its cleanliness has always been up compared to two other locations I have visited. I cannot comment on how rough it is during peak hours because I avoid going during those times. \n\nStars knocked off because: 1.) there have been a few lockers where I see the same lock on for weeks when their policy is that you cannot keep things locked overnight (even the small things count) 2.) The women's locker room sink area aaalways smells like death. 3.) Bad front desk workers with snippy attitudes.\n\nOther than that, it's pretty decent. Parking is good (again, not visiting during peak hours), equipment is cleaned and maintained, and it is located in a complex to tempt your taste buds after your workout lol.",1
Friendly fast service and they righted a wrong done by another tire place. I couldn't be happier. I will be back for free rotations and pressure checks as needed.,4
"La Comida was not our first choice for dinner, but after attempting to eat at three other places, it was the only joint that was open and didn't have an hour wait. \n\nIt was late on a Monday night, so it wasn't even close to crowded. However, the service was some of the worst that I have ever experienced. Getting water refills and the check was painfully slow.\n\nThe food was overpriced and uninspired. You expect fajitas to come out sizzling on a hot cast iron, but there was just a small hunk of meat and a lot of veggies on a plate. The carnitas tacos were dry and underwhelming, and did not come in the pulled pork form that I am accustomed to eating. My margarita was not much better. \n\nI feel like this place spends more energy trying to look impressive with the decor and fancy names for menu items than it does on its food and service.",0
"Recently went back to Regan's for lunch & discovered a lot has changed since my initial visit. Apparently, they lost chef & then changed out menu. Now more typical pub menu - nothing special. Food was ok... Service was fine. The only thing that was truly wonderful was the cheesecake -our server told us that someone who works there bakes all the cheesecakes from scratch. I would go back just for another piece of that yummy cheesecake!",2
"We went here for dinner last night.  The price was $26/person.. not bad considering there are raw oysters, big shrimp cocktail, sea bass, salmon, duck drumettes, Prime rib, ribs.  It is not the largest spread I've been to like at the Rio in Las Vegas, however, it is not as pricey either.. Surprisingly the stone oven baked pizza was awesome.. they had one with wagyu beef on it that was really good.  Service was extremely attentive, the staff very polite, and the food was consistently being replaced.  In fact, I was reaching for some grilled asparagus when the server behind the counter told me to leave that and he would have some fresh grilled asparagus for me to take instead... This is one of the cleanest buffet's I have ever been to as well.  If all you are looking for is a huge buffet and you don't care about the quality of food this may not be your place, however, I found the selection to be more than sufficient... oh did I mention they have gelato.. really yummy gelato..?  Good buffet, I would recommend.",4
"Perhaps I'm just not used to Indian Casinos, being from Reno I have a certain expectation for casinos having been around them my whole life, that said.... I did not enjoy this place. I have gone there twice now and experienced that same dussapointment.\n\nIts extremely crowded, there is rarely an open machine or table. The tables are all way over priced and there are strange suspicious characters everywhere. If you can manage to get on a machine, no doubt someone will come and hover over you until you are so creeped out you surrender the machine. \n\nThe payouts are lousy and the food (we at at the cafe downstairs) was underwhelming. \n\nAlso its one of the only smoke friendly places you can go so its basically a giant ashtray - I reeked when I got homem .\n\nJust not a good time.",0
Ok. Truth is...it's an upscale Mexican restaurant with a some BBQ items on the menu. And even those have a Mexican flair (e.g. Pulled pork served with black beans and tortillas.)  Not bad ...just know that it's not a down home BBQ joint  with greasy fries and soggy bread. Pricy - but decent portions (for the pulled pork anyway).  Ordered a margarita without seeing a price list.  My bad because when I got the tab it surprised me that the drink cost $9-it wasn't worth $9.  Place is just too expensive.,2
Great place :) the menu has a great variety I had breakfast and it was  amazing :) I am excited to go back and try lunch and dinner :) we has Jesse as our server and he  very pleasant :) we even played a game of darts after !,4
I am a total fan! I came in 10 minutes before close (sorry employees!) and they were still super nice to me. I love their selection and I cant wait to go back and buy wine. \n\nThis trip I was picking up torani syrups because i'm on an italian soda kick. They had so many great flavors! my current fav is peach :)   I totally need to take advantange of their .05c wine sale one of these days...\n\n\nGetcho booty patooty over there.,3
"The only reason to visit this casino is to EAT the artery clogging food at Nathan's.  Hot dogs - American, Jalapeno, White Castle burgers, Fries, Chocolate dipped banana for 99 cents...Deep Fried Oreos!\n\nThis is just a casino with no hotel attached, so kids can not enter.  Machines are old style - no tickets. Girls in brightly colored outfits hand out beads to all who enter. \n\nI had the Deep Fried Twinkies and it was just as imagined.  Hot, thick slightly crisp around the edges batter enveloped the Twinkie.  A mound of powdered sugar and chocolate chips topped it all.  Yum.  Major sugar rush.\n\nBe prepared to stand in line.\n\nWorth a visit for the cheap food.",1
"Got the Camaro Burger (double). The patties tasted like they did not have any seasoning or salt, they were greasy. The grilled onions were hard, not cooked long enough. The bun fell apart and I would up with a mess all over my hands as I ate the burger.\nThe best part was the wrapper on the burger which had an outside foil which kept my burger hot when i got home which was a first. Great idea. \n\nI'm going back to Carl's to get their \""Big Carl\"" burger which is much better and has a lower price.",0
Slowest. Starbucks. Ever! It's faster to drive a little bit further out to get better service.,0
"If you compare this to some of the buffet's on the strip then this place is definitely 2 or 3 stars. However, it's not that bad if you are here and staying at or near this hotel. They provide a wide selection of food, which does the trick, but nothing earth shattering. I thought the prime rib had way too much fat, the stir fry had way too much sodium, and the desserts just blatantly sucked! I actually liked the taco bar, and the seafood was decent. A bottle of wine was like $7 so I guess that's a consolation! ;) So don't expect the world but it's an option if you're really hungry.",1
"Tried this place last night. It was packed and although my friends and I enjoyed all the food overall, there were some serious service snafus. Our server was hurried and not at all on top of it. He should have had some help, as he made a couple of serious mistakes. I ordered a glass of cabernet and my partner asked for chardonnay. Almost every restaurant automatically serve the 'house' or lowest price wine when someone orders a glass of cab etc. Our server did not. He took it upon himself to substitute a glass that was 3 times the price of the house wine (the portion of wine was also very small, like 4 ounces). When the check arrived I tried to find the manager, and a hostess finally foind him outside. He was nice enough  and said he would fix the check. He reduced the  wine portion from $48 to $24, still $4 more than it should have been. Our server managed a poor apology and told me he was too busy and simply made a mistake. Hmmmm. Not buying it. Another note, get rid of the crappy, loud piped in Spanish music and add  some air conditioning,thr restaurant atmosphete made us all want to leave asap. So food 4 stars, service 2 stars.",2
"I think most people are to hard on Macayo's.  The great thing about Phoenix is that there is so many great mexican food places, so sometimes Macayos gets the shaft.  The thing is they are good.  The salsa and chips are very good, in fact by the end of dinner we usually go through 2 bowls.  My favorite appitizers are the Red Corn Chicken Taquitos.  These are fantastic!  They are chicken taquitos topped with Baja sauce.  I really like most of their dishes, but my favorite is the chicken poblano.  It is a poblano stuffed with shredded chicken, fried and topped with relleno sauce and baja sauce.  I highly recommend it.  I live in California, where the mexican food is sub par at best.  I can't wait to go back to Macayo's and stuff myself.",4
"My friends from Madison took me here on a beautiful June night for the views. We had already had dinner, so we were just there to enjoy cocktails and dessert. \n\nService was great. Our waitress was attentive without being overbearing and was very friendly and sweet. We each started off with summer cocktails- between us we had the strawberry basil mojito, the blueberry lemonade (I think that's what it was- it was very very sweet), and some concoction made with clementines and summer in a glass. All were pretty good. \n\nWe also had some desserts- the deconstructed snickers bar tart and the buttermilk beignets. Both were delicious. \n\nThe menu looked interesting but friends told me it's better for just apps or just dessert. I'd definitely go back though.",3
"I AM A FAN.... of this funky little downtown dining spot. I don't really understand the theme, or maybe there isn't one at all... it's just cool! Nice patio for outside dining, which is what my wife and I opted for last week on a perfect spring evening. Our server was quick to take our orders (it was a pretty slow night, but hey, it was a Monday), and was very attentive to us our entire visit. The food was decent enough. I had the Chile Burger and my Wife had the Ostrich burger (which I actually thought was overpriced.... $12.95 for a 6oz patty... hmmmm). The fries and the potatoes that came on the side were really good though! \n\nFrom what my friends have told me, this is one of the best happy hour spots (price wise) in downtown Phoenix! We were there after happy hour and the drink prices were still pretty cheap! I'm definitely planning on dining/drinking here again!\n\nLastly, I gotta give a shout out to Vinny! The dude is probably one of the nicest, most genuine people out there! Anyone would be lucky to have him as your server at Steve's!!",3
They are really creative with their pizza! My fave is the Thai Chicken pizza. The only downside is that sometimes it arrives cold...,2
"Reserving specific seats is nice and the kids serving were polite, but  the rest of the concept and execution doesnt work for me. It's too dark to see menus, trailers are too loud to easily communicate with wait staff (let alone your companion), and  settling tabs during films is inevitably distracting.  \n\nI'm told their Cinema Suites format is more spacious than our \""Fork & Screen\"" option,  but when the 400 pound patron in front of me descended into his Playskool-strength theatre seat - and into my knees with the force of a medium speed car accident, that less than luxurious 'impression' evoked something more akin to \""Fuck & Scream\"" -  I literally blurted \""Fuck\"" and screamed at  the bone cracking pain  radiating from both patellas. \n\nWhen I slid over behind fatso's 100+ pound wife, she's banging into me too, so it's not their fault. The seats are just cheap, with lousy springs and they're hard to settle into comfortably.  I was kicked from behind periodically.  All by adults btw.  It's interesting how many yelpers rip kids and seem to feel 'adults only' or food/bev service somehow conveys a first class experience.  To me it felt more like a bad coach flight; cabin lighting's busted and some douchebag's  reclining into your space.",1
"Unlike what the yelp category states, this is a Sikh temple, not a Hindu temple. \n\nThe place is hard to find, as it sits on a residential corner with a lot of shrubbery in front and a rather short nishan sahib (orange flag indicating it is a house of Sikh worship). Good luck finding parking in their tiny lot, you will most likely have to park on the adjacent street and walk back to the temple. There is a space in the fence you can walk through so you don't have to go all the way back to Russel and enter that way. There are double doors on one side of the building, but don't try to enter that way; the actual entry is on the south side past the kitchen. \n\nThis is an old house that was converted into the open community rooms you'll find today. Be forewarned that there is no air conditioner and little shade outside of the building. Make sure you stay hydrated before visiting! Service starts around 12:30, although a lot of people come earlier for snacks beforehand. \n\nAlways make sure that you take off your shoes at the back entry, where they have a huge shoe rack, and cover your head before entering. There are separated men and women's restrooms through a door on the left just after entering. The entry room serves as a tiny langar hall, although they have a couple folded tables set out under a makeshift porch. There is a cute little altar inside the main room. After services are over, people turn the main room into a temporary langar hall and serve food to the seated. I don't know how appropriate the method is, but the place is tiny, so I guess they do with what they have.",1
"It was always a pleasure getting the happy hour half off shakes, but not last night. My sister and I went to this store to buy shakes last night. After 3 hours of consuming those said shakes, we both had gotten food poisoning. I was awake all night long, but my sister who ordered a small sized shake, felt a bit better than i was. I'm going to contact the Corporate about this.",1
Went here around 10 pm on a week night and it was not busy. Took about 15 mins to get a table and even longer to order. Service was slow but food was good. Prices are a little high but it's ARIA so that was expected. A good place to just sit and relax while you wait for your food but not a good place if you have plans and have to be somewhere.,2
"Breakfast is the best on the strip, and Dinner with the fountains in the back round is one of the best views in vegas. This is a must go to spot on the strip,  Reasonable prices for the strip",4
"I feel bad giving a bad review as Gino's used to be so good.  Our last visit, which was our first one in many years was just not good.  The service was slow, slow, slow.  The old fashions were terrible, no fruit or anything, and my spaghetti and meatballs were worse than the place in the mall.  The meatballs were super oily and had little flavor, and the spaghetti had hardly any marinara sauce on it at all.  Very strange.  I like the old school Italian atmosphere, but for the price (which is a little high considering) and the inconvenience of no parking I would not go back :-(  Sorry.",1
"It's telling that Bramble has a few 'guest' drinks on their menu from such internationally well-renowned bars as NYC's Milk & Honey and London's 69 Colebrooke Row. This is the caliber of cocktail crafting that is exhibited in the cosy cavern a mere few minutes walk from Edinburgh's city centre.\n\nBeing a lover of all concoctions with coloured spirits, the Campbelltown Cocktail with a Springbank 10 year base caught my eye (and my tastebuds). On-menu offerings tend to be contemporary takes on traditional recipes, but undoubtedly you could go wild with some off-menu requests to tap the creativity of the folks behind the counter. \n\nAnyone who follows the DrinkBoston blog is likely to know what they're doing with a jigger and a shaker. Bramble's fine bartenders are no exceptions to this rule.",3
This is our store and they are usually really good.  But they missed it this morning - Friday before a holidaybweekend and only one register open at 10 am.  Unusually long wait,1
"Its hard to rate a place on interaction of one said teenager female employee, but I must.   Here after referred to as HER.\n\nEveryone here is of great professionalism, however the weakest link breaks the chain. \n\nMy work friends and I find it a gamble to see who is working on the day we decide to visit. If it is not HER things are great and friendly and fast. \n\nIf it is HER we get the blank, empty stare with no eye contact or customer service energy. Its like she (HER) rather be in bed sleeping or she could even by high or something.\n\nI'm sure this store could figure out who HER is and fix the issue.\n\nAlso, why offer grilled chicken breasts if there is never any available?  Or it takes 20 mins to make but, wait, you drop the chicken of the floor (HER) and we wait 10 more minutes. But wait, you gave our chicken to someone else who walked in and out the door (HER) so we have to wait 10 more minutes again only to have to take our food to go because the lunch hour is almost up?\n\nOr even worse, at another visit we asked for grilled chicken breasts and you say you don't have any?  Only way to get it is to tell the cashier that you will wait for it. \n\nGood luck on that. Might I recommend Roberto's Tacos or Yogi's Teriyaki in the same shopping center?",0
"Ok here's an update since they remodeled the trop / Durango location: it's more like a health food market now with the fresh food counter where you can order meals but I haven't tried it yet. I like how much more open it is and the entryway lets you browse some of those impulse items. ( I bought a little Xmas tree!) without getting crowded.  BUT that darn checkout got me again 3 times while trying to checkout!!!  One was for authorization to purchase a drink mixer that didn't even contain alcohol, one because it couldn't detect that I bagged an item and I forget what the other was for. I had maybe 10 items. No I won't be going back anytime soon",1
Nice halls and garden areas along with ample parking make this a good choice for those who'd like to tie the knot not too far from the city centre.,1
Best Barros I've had in a while. As long as the Maura is working. My food was perfect. Definitely worth the drive from Peoria.,4
"Was here two days ago for a gel manicure. The \""manager guy\"" attempted to do my nails while answering the phone and all sorts of other duties, after 20 minutes of practice, he was doing a very bad job and I think he knew it. He got just up and left and then some other lady came over and started the whole process over.  I am back today because 6 out of ten gel nails literally peeled off after two days. The \""manager guy\"" isn't happy to see me today and tells me they are very very busy and I need to come back later. Well, since I ran 3 miles to get here, ( trying to get my exercise in at the same time ) I said I would wait. Now I am sitting here waiting. I don't think I am coming back here anymore. Actually, I know I won't be back here anymore. Not a very friendly place at all.",0
"We finally checked out Buzz'n Brush at The Orleans. What a great time Mari and I had. They have a unique program were everyone has a good time. They have a planned painting that they teach you to paint. You learn about brushes and how to use them. I was really surprised how good the pictures turned out. They have a full bar, pizza ovens and a wild staff that loves to have fun. If you looking for something fun to do, call them and set up a time. My next visit will be with a group, I think it would be a hoot to make an event of the activity. We even learned a new dance. Yes booze, food, music fun and you walk away with a painting. What more can you ask for? What a great time. You have to try it. The staff is bananas.",4
"I really like this bank, the staff is friendly and always take care of what I need.  I hate talking through the glass with bank tellers, and that is never a problem here. The design is nice and when I walk in its easy to relax, and then everyone is nice and they smile.  This is the best banking experience I have had.  We now have our personal and business accounts with Midfirst bank.",4
"Came for breakfast 09/30/11. We are pretty easy going, but this was the worst service ever. First off, the server did not want anyone there and was annoyed when we showed up. Coffee was horrible. We tried to order cinnamon rolls for kids off the menu. Didn't have them. Tried to order cereal... None. Mimosas were gross. I ordered the breakfast pizza and they forgot the eggs and tomatoes. Had to send it back. The bacon was burned. To top it off she screwed up the bill as well. No apologies or anything. Will never come back for bfast.",0
"Nice concept, but slow service. It's a Burger King \""bar\"" with a build your own burger menu. They also serve beer, but it took 20 minutes for me to get an order of medium fries. Not good. Don't make a hungry b*tch wait!",1
"Don't tell my husband I didn't give it five stars!!!!\n\nHH was good. Well, it was ok. I had to act more in love with it than I really was because the husband was so hyped. When you're married to me you only have so much in life, so I let him have his moment. \n\nI had the pork tenderloin sandwich and he ordered the 1 lb burger stuffed with mashed potatoes and bacon. I heard the food portions were huge and I considered having us split an entree, but being on vacation we opted for being typical Americans instead. The food came out and it WAS huge. Stupidly huge. \n\nThe pork tenderloin was the diameter of a dinner plate but the bun that it was set upon was normal size. Using the bun like a cookie cutter, I trimmed the excess pork so I could pick it up. The pork was awesome--just really big. \n\nHusbands burger was ok. It really didn't have any flavor and I was really turned off by the mashed potatoes in it. He loves mashed potatoes, so maybe that's why he thought it was so amazing. Eh. Mac n' cheese was good. \n\nService started out great with an attentive waiter but by the end of the meal he had disappeared. I flagged someone down just as he reappeared and at that point his attitude had shifted. Odd. \n\nWould I eat here again? Only if I were to take someone who had never been here before. Other than that, it's just mediocre food.",2
"A fun way to spend an hour or so with the family, kids or just your significant other.  When the animals have all gone to bed, the zoo comes to life with holiday lights!  Lights are wrapped in and around trees and cactus all through the zoo.  (I would not want to be the guy putting lights on the cactus!!)  The food vendors are doling out hot chocolate and kettle corn for your sugared up walk around the park.  There is a little light and music show on the water, which was okay and killed a few minutes in the park.  All in all, for $18 a person, I think they could add something a little more thrilling than the water show, but the zoo lights are a cute thing to see at least once. Note: There are no heaters, so dress appropriately to be warm outside for an hour or more.",2
I use to go to Smiths all the time when I lived close to one but now it's  harder to get to one. This one has great donuts and they always seem fresh. Now that they carry blue bell ice cream I might be making more trips even though it's not close to my house,3
"Ovens, you old queen, you.\n\nWent here for Billy Elliott (great!), and I had forgotten what an old place this was. Between the crappy parking ($6 in a poorly lit lot) and musty carpeting, I'm glad we still have this in Charlotte as a venue BUT I don't recommend spending full price here. I think it would be better spent at the Actor's Theater, Blumenthal or Booth.\n\nThe bar is not good ($5 for 6 oz of SutterHome wine? $5 for MIller Lite in a can?), and the balcony is just too far away to really make out the details. The sound and lighting is good, but you never get \""Lost in the play\"" here at Ovens - the old surroundings are just too overpowering.\n\nIn retrospect, I should have splurged and gotten orchestra seats. NO BALCONY SEATS EVER AGAIN! Get orchestra and you're good to go - Just remember to pack a flask.",2
"I have dined here on multiple occasions. The pizza is very good.  I just have a few issues with the place. First, they only have beer and wine. No rum and cokes for me! Secondly, most of the pizzas don't have meat on them. As a carnivore I want sausage and pepperoni! Third, they don't have much for kids. Overall, I would say the place is ok. Just very convenient when you live 3 blocks away!",2
"My husband and I tried this restaurant because we had a coupon from the Bucky Book, and we are glad we did!  I had the BBQ brisket which was some of the most tender flavorful beef I have ever had.  They were also very accommodating when I asked to substitute mixed vegetables for the corn on the cob.  My husband thoroughly enjoyed his stroganoff, and we were both pleased that we were able to watch the game during our meal.  There are TVs everywhere, so you have a good view from wherever you are.  The service was excellent.  I will definitely be back!  I recommend giving the pumpkin beer a try if it's still available.",4
"Naked city had a quiet opening, snuggled next to the hofbrauhaus across from the hard rock casino. This area has been joe's pizza territory for a while. Well move on over joe's! \n\nHaving been to naked city well over a handful of time since they opened, I've taken a break from joes and do not look to return. Food is the name of the game and naked city pizza plays it well. The menu features a range of items you'd expect from pizza places these days. Pizza, wings, pasta, burgers. How do you take something done a million times and still make it worth it to eat? You make it better, and that's simply what nc does. I can't speak for their plain or pepperoni pizza, which I'm sure is excellent. Naked city shines with its multiple specialty pizza, ranging from a great steak and cheese pizza with white garlic sauce, to meatball pizza and various other combinations. The pizza is freshly made in a timely manner and comes out with great flavors. No one part of a pizza there is better than the other, you'll find yourself enjoying every bite you take. \n\nAway from the pizza norms, nc has an excellent choice for wing lovers. Try the hot sicilian if you want a spicy kick with some excellent flavors! And if you really want some heat, check out the blazing suicide fries! Among the menu is also the ma burger, a heaping size of a burger that skips no shortcuts in the delicious category. And if you need a getaway to a land sweet and savory, grab yourself a cannoli for dessert. You'll thank me later!\n\nNaked city is still settling in, but has been nothing short of great. Check it out and I'm sure you'll enjoy!",4
Delicious potstickers! Green curry and spicy basil are amazing!! Service is quick and friendly! Best Thai food in Mesa!!,4
"When I scheduled a massage and mini facial for Saturday afternoon I was beyond disappointed in the service. I walked in the door and there was no receptionist so I had to wait over 10 minutes just to be greeted by an employee. Then, I was told that I didn't have an appointment. Granted, I had called the previous day and left a voicemail asking if it was possible to cancel my appointment and re-schedule, that voicemail was never returned so I figured I would just go, even though it was a busy weekend for me. I never received a call back, or confirmation of anything, my appointment was merely cancelled by the staff without letting me know, and re-scheduled with someone else. When I explained to them that I had driven all the way from North Glendale (almost an hour) in order to make this appointment they showed no sense of sympathy, no sense of trying to solve the problem, I was merely told that oh well I would need to re-schedule. In fact, I never even received an apology, I was told that it was cancelled and assumed that I would realize it was cancelled since I left a voicemail. It almost makes me not want to return here even thought I prepaid for the services. The least they could do is try to apologize and make THEIR MISTAKE worth my driving time. Maybe a small upgrade, or at least let me know that they could fit me in on the next business day, or later that afternoon. TERRIBLE CUSTOMER SERVICE, ESPECIALLY FOR A RETURNING CUSTOMER. The poor lady behind me felt bad and offered me her massage time, and was told by the employees that wouldn't work since I had a facial as well. The only reason that I am giving this place two stars is because my previous massage I had was a wonderful experience.",1
Haven't eaten here so this review is just based on the bar experience I had the other day while my girlfriend and I were in town eating somewhere else.  I really liked the feel of this bar.  There's nothing specific I can put my finger on but it was just cozy and it wasn't very crowded.  Sometimes you just want to have a drink somewhere that isn't packed out.\n\nThe beer selection could be a little bit better but I'll chalk that up to it being a place that probably caters more to domestic drinkers than craft beer drinkers.  The bar staff were great and friendly and it really felt like a neighborhood type place.,2
"Las Vegas has a long history of money, music, and entertainment. You can see it as you walk down the Strip, and the adjacent streets that connect to this central artery. Unfortunately, the more glamorous and stylish the Strip gets, the sadder and more crippled the old vanguard become. Sadly, Circus Circus falls directly into the depressing ashes of a Las Vegas no longer ruled by crooners and clowns, but the young and the flashy.\n\nOne of the most obvious, and visually offensive, things that deter people away from this place is the interior and exterior design. Although the bright lights attract attention in the desert night, the incandescent bulbs show the mark of age compared to the newer fluorescent and LED lights in use at newer hotel/casinos. And after the book/movie \""It\"" by Stephen King, the giant clown in front of the casino is a flashing sign of death and doom. No clown fearing human will dare enter a lair of evil. \n\nOnce you walk in, you see the gaudy gold and brown floors and ceilings, and it reminds you of an old man bearing his chest hair with cheaply made gold chains around his neck. It is a sight that just reeks of old and outdated. As you walk through the casino to get to the elevators, you see even the machines are ancient. What's worse is the casino is usually only at about 64.3% capacity. There's nothing sadder than an empty, ancient casino.\n\nYou get to your room and what do you see? Same boring walls with same boring interior. It almost feels like you're in a motel. All the rooms will smell like ash, even though you're in a smoke-free room, and the walls are thin enough to hear what the people next door are planning to do to each other after a few drinks. Definitely no place for roaming children's ears to hear.\n\nHowever, the biggest save for this place is their aim at children, with their Adventuredome amusement park. I have a feeling if it wasn't for this, no one would come here. The children seem to love this place and with good reason. The place is a giant indoor carnival. Being the only place on the Strip with something so accommodating for children, parents can leave their children here with a certain amount of money and do their own things for a few hours. \n\nCircus Circus is a conundrum. It's a casino that caters to people with children, but at the same time, shouldn't be a place to bring children. The pricing for rooms is cheap, but so is the experience you get while staying there. The glitz and glamour that allure most people towards a casino have long faded away at Circus Circus. Sadly, until this place renovates in a way to attract both families AND the young, it'll be a monolith to the aging history of a Las Vegas no longer needed or wanted.",1
"This review is from when I saw the show, in November 2008.\n\nWOW.  This was the first Cirque show I ever saw, and every one I have seen since then hasn't measured up (except O, which is a very close second).  I was blown away by the acrobatics, and loved that there was a story to follow within it - it's the only Cirque show I've seen that successfully pulls off a clear storyline with amazing stunts.\n\nI am sad to see that some yelpers think it has gone downhill in the past few years....I do want to see it again and hope that it's of the same quality as when I saw it back in '08!",4
"I'm used to the cringe-worthy bar tabs that can be accrued while bar hopping in Tempe. After frequenting Baseline Pub on several occasions with my friends, I've been pleasantly suprised by their inexpensive drink selection and shot prices. This bar is a great dive. TV's, darts, pool tables, cool bartenders, great drink prices and always a fairly lively crowd. Not much else I can ask for.\n\nWe stopped by the other night for my friends' birthday and I ordered a round of a very specific shot. When the shots arrived, it was easy to deduce that the bartender didn't know how to make the ones I asked for. I was happy to order another round of the correct mix, but she comp'd the round for us and kept the peanuts coming! We'll definitely be coming back soon.",3
"Are you as confused as me as how to pronouse sygn? When all it is really is an i replaced by a y? \n\nAnyway, it's an upmarket bar. I didn't find the prices insanely hiked - not exactly Wetherspoons, but I've certainly seen worse as well. Definitely not a place you want to come with a semi-dry wallet and itch to leave unable to stand. It looked more like a place you would sup a cocktail or a glass of vino rather than chug on a steiner. My only small quibble would be the extensive cocktail menu didnt' cater for the dd's like myself - although the Firefly selection of drinks were pretty delicious.\n\nHowever, overall I thought it was rather nice - a pleasant bar with table service, pleasant staff who remembered orders and didn't go too crazy even when they had guests waiting to take their (reserved) table that we had hijacked earlier on in the day (note - when I say hijacked, i mean we agreed with the waitress that we would sit there til they needed to reset the table in advance of their reservation). I would be happy to return here but definitely a little closer to pay day.",2
"The people that work here are dumber than a bag full of hammers....handed them their own frequent buyer stamp card after purchasing ten drinks on prior visits and between four employees they couldn't figure out what kind of discount to provide me on which size drink despite the fact that it says \""free 16 ounce drink\"" right on the card!! Another fine example of solid public education in Charlotte! Know what you want and pay in exact change because chances are pretty good that the person working the register will be too stupid to figure out the change to provide you...",0
I booked a same-day appointment for a haircut and Meghan was so helpful in making sure she was doing what I wanted and we had a great conversation. She offered beverages and the loft is adorable. Highly recommended!,4
"Every since this new director has taken over, this place has turn from decent to extremly terrible. I recently took my daughter out. Every day I took her to daycare there was a new teacher. All the teacher that had been employess for numberous years either quit or walked out. The director has a very impatient uncaring attitude. Not someone I would have taking care of children or supervising people that did. All the teachers look extremely stressed and unhappy and who does that affect? The children. My daughter had a bathroom incident and was wet when I picked her up. No one bothered to change her. She was crying in a corner when I came in. In a months time I received 3 calls telling me my child was injured. Never resolved. You get charged fees without prior knowledge of why! If you want a piece of mind when you drop your child off definately dont take them here!!!!!!!!!! I dont know how the other childrens choice centers are. You cant judge all of them for one bad apple, meaning the current director at palace station child care. Dont think you can complain and get results either because the director is also friends with the regional director connie. Severeal witnesess have heard these two laugh about parents complaints after pretending to address them. What a joke!!!!! Who hired this lady!  After nearly half the staff quits or walks out wouldnt it seem like someone would try and investigate why? guess not cause she is still there. I have talked to other parents  who had children attending there, they was taken out to, reason.....all the same. New director!!!!!!! I know this place has lost money and children.",0
"Best \nVenue\nEver\n\nI've seen quit a few shows and The Pearl is by far the best venue I've been to thus far.  Not a bad seat in the house.

"Asian Fusion sounds about right. The food was horrible, they're serving dumplings and rice at a premium price. If you have money to spend and want asian food because you don't know what it's really about, then this is for you. I guess they have a great business plan geared only towards Americans who believe in this crap.\n\nOn the side note, they offered great service and I really liked the ambience.",0
"My sister is here from NY and she's on a Mexican food hunt. We went here and ordered a bistec burrito, king beef tacos, and a chicken quesadilla, and horchata. \n\nThe food was delicious! It was so authentic and flavorful! The flavors of the grilled opinion and jalepenos meshed so well together for a tasty kick in the mouth! I'm super picky about guacamole and I loved theres. It was creamy with the right amount of flavor. The horchata was ok, it was a little too ricey for my liking, but I liked that it wasn't super sweet.  My sister was very happy! I can't wait to try their tortas! The food was definitely 5 stars for Mexican food.\n\nThe prices were great! We got all that for about $30.00.\n\nThe only reason they lost a star from me is because the girls up front are lacking personalities. They are very pretty but very unprofessional.",3
"Don't know why we were in Caesar's Palace if what I was craving was a sammy from Earl's... but we stopped at Trevi b/c I've never eaten there before & the food seemed okay (just not the price).  Being too lazy to walk all the way back to the car & having to do all that parking again, I decided to just stop here.  (Mind you I wasn't feeling all that great).\n\nOrdered a margherita pizza... ended up not eating it b/c I was feeling so nauseous... BUT I will say that the staff was great & I felt bad b/c I had barely touched my food.  The bread w/ olive oil looked great, but didn't eat any.  The appetizer made me sick to my stomach (the smell was too much for me)... had I gone when I wasn't hungover, I probably would have had a better time.  :]\n\nOverly priced italian food nonetheless.  Nice intimate setting & good for those w/ kids.",2
thank you for las vegas premium outlets for upgrading this indoor mall!!! finally the renovations are done and shopping is very convenient now. they have added more stores and there is two foods courts for customers to enjoy!!,4
"A few different areas to review here.\nWe live in Phoenix and were running in the Phoenix Marathon and Half Marathon.  There were a total of 5 of us.  I had reserved two rooms, one with a king bed and the other with two beds.  I had confirmation #'s for both rooms and both rooms were in my name.  The day before our check-in I called the hotel to confirm and to ask them to put our friends name on the room that had the king bed in it because they were most likely to arrive before us and would like to check-in without me there.  As it turned out, we arrived together so we checked in together. \nI was first and was given the king room.  When I advised the clerk that I had reserved the double room for me he looked for the other room and I could tell from the look on his face that there was a problem.  He took my piece of paper that had our confirmation #'s written on them into the back office where we could see everything play out on the video screen that was at the front desk.  Soon a man came out that must have been a manager - advising me that we were suppose to check in the day before for a 3 night stay and when we didn't they cancelled our room.  I told him that that was a mistake on their part because I had booked the rooms at the same time with everything being the same with the exception of the # of beds in the room.  He again told me that the room was cancelled and that they were full for the night and there was nothing he could do.  I was getting pretty angry now and told him that it was unacceptable especially since it was their mistake and he had better find me a room.  Believe it or not but he found me a room!  Then when we made a joke about how lucky we were to have him solve the situation, joking that did you have to throw someone out, he told us that it actually caused him a lot of work to find a room for us!  Really, it caused you a lot of work??  Your clerked messed up my reservation, it wasn't my fault and you are complaining to me that this caused you extra work??\n\nThe hotel was advertised with having a hot breakfast for the runners which it did not have.  They told us that we could have a danish and coffee.  We also had coffee in our room which was fine.\n\nThey advertised shuttles for the runners. Yes, this was available but we did not use this service.\n\nOur room was old because the hotel was old.  The room was very clean but did have a smell to it.  I think the housekeeping staff does a fine job with what they have to work with.\n\nWould I stay there again?  No",1
"The menu and food here was great! The service, was horrible! I think for a sandwich shop downtown, you should be able to work quickly, be friendly, not get flustered however; the staff the day I went in had none of those things going for them. And worse, were very un-apologetic for being so! I repeated my order (a simple turkey sandwich) to 3 different people and 4 times total. As I repeated it a 2nd time to the 3rd person, she said \""Ok, I got it!\"" when I repeated it louder than the first time I told her. (My fault apparently) Then we waited for them to figure out who had what sandwich, one came out before the other (my friend's) The whole situation was way too frustrating. But unfortunately, I loved my food so I will most likely go back and hope for a better experience!",1
"Le Burger Brasserie clearly benefits from its location -- steps away from the intersection of Bally's and Paris and, more importantly, all the convention halls filled with out-of-towners unwittingly looking for a quick, cheap place to grab a bite. I landed here because of a Groupon. The potato skins were tiny and limp. The Le bleu burger ($13) was decent, but mainly because the cheese and bacon  made up for the dense  and uninspired patty. Places like this don't have to produce a great product because of all the one-and-done customers that routinely fill their space. And, like them I won't be back.",1
"Family outing....\n\nGoods: I had the meatloaf sandwich, come on any place that has a meatloaf sandwich on the menu starts at 4 stars without even trying and I'll work from there.  I also had the Onion rings which where top notch also.  On the healthier side...we got milkshakes and the Chocolate one was nice and thick where you had to spoon some of it out.\n\nNice place to visit. They have done the decor to try and date the store to the old soda shops which is nice to look around and enjoy.",2
"I go to Starbucks every afternoon and order an iced coffee with cream and vanilla. \n\nNot at Barnes and Noble. The barista makes me an iced coffee with vanilla and points me at the creamer table. I point out to him that the cream should be in the drink already. He point's again at the creamer table and says it's over there. I thanked him.  Left the drink on the counter and left. I will never go back.  \n\nNot sure about Barnes and Noble since I just purchased a Nook and paid for a membership.  \n\nI was looking forward to drinking coffee,  enjoying free wifi at Barnes and Noble.  Never again.",0
"I was about to grab a sandwich at Brooklyn Bagel when I noticed this place. I love Mediterranean food, so I thought this would be an interesting place to check out since it a casual little spot. I was greeted and walked through the process of ordering. It's basically the way you order at Chipotle. You pick your carb, meat and toppings. They have two spits, one roasting steak and the other chicken. I went with the steak wrap and added hummus, ZiKiZ dressing and the usual Med toppings to basically make myself a salad in a wrap. The steak was delicious. Not dry and had good flavor. I definitely would stop back by if in the area. Just wish they had room for one more spit to do lamb.",2
"Pretty much like the Venetian (they're connected), but it seemed more on the \""grown up\"" side.  Haha.  Spacious rooms, but not as extravagant as those Venetian suites, I felt.\n\nThey have Lavo, which I've never been to-seems like a smaller club.  Cute places to eat and drink at, and take pictures of-but all of the action really is at the Venetian.",3
"This was my first attempt at a Sushi restaraunt.  I have been to plenty of places that serve sushi, but not as their specialty.  Ra was really not much better, and the service was...OK.  There seemed to be plenty of people in there having a good time, and I did enjoy the food, but would rather go somewhere I could hold a conversation if I am going to spend $40 on a couple meals.",1
"What an Experience! I arrived at MSK and was promptly greeted, by who I think was the owner, with a warm and friendly hello. Decor and ambiance was lovely and I couldn't get enough of the rotisserie aroma throughout. I ordered the Walu, a new creation of chef Matt Taylor. It was amazing with sophisticated flavors. It left me feeling satisfied and light at the same time. We enjoyed the unique cocktails and tap wines. Our server was entertaining and knowledgeable. Don't miss out!",4
Always great service.  I never feel like they are trying to take advantage of me.,4
"I got the 32oz. Mango Kush, I wasn't impressed.  The cups are weirdly shaped with a long straw.",1
I love this Ross it is hit and miss but digging there all the cloths is worth it,3
"It's a fun experience. But realize it is an experience and not a sit down restaurant that you're going to be catered for your every desire. There are no tables or seats. There is plenty of lawn to sit upon. Think of it as a carnival food area minus all the junk food and instead you have these higher end menu selections. It's a crowd, for sure!  Some trucks have really long lines, like 40 people!  Some have just a few people. Though I'm not sure I'd rate the truck based upon the line, though I can imagine that some do and that's how a long line gets longer. I went to a short line truck that featured kimchi and ramen in their food items and I liked it!  (Sorry, I can't remember the name.). But it's a fun crowd, people bring their dogs. I enjoyed it very much.",3
"Went back yet again for another touch up for my \""ombre\"" fade from my natural (black) to light brown.  This time I was unable to book my appointment with Emily B. so instead she suggested I go with Roxanne.\n\nRoxy was amazing! She did a wonderful job weaving the ombre into my hair that had already been treated to daken back to my original color (due to previously having highlights). She gently handled my hair professionally and perfectly.  \n\nEmily B. was able to complete the look with a face flattering cut (as per usual) and I am extremely appreciative.  These ladies know their stuff, execute it well, are friendly, considerate of their customers' needs/wants, and have wonderful personalities too! Thanks again to The Root for another awesome job and great service! :)",4
So i came in today 9/4/14 with 900 in hand looking for a S&W 9mm only to be greeted by the short muscle man behind the counter (aka the jerk/other names) look I know you deal everyday with people who think they know guns but some of us actually do. he treated me like a kid who had no clue what he wanted. while in fact I'm a 9 year army vet of Iraq and Afghanistan believe it or not I knew what I came in for. he treated me like shit telling me I had no idea what I was saying. I guess saying surefire x300 and S&W 9mm tactical doesn't make sense and a black halk holster is stupid or....... He is an asshole worst service I've ever had. store looks like shit and is a poor excuse for a gun store guns may be cheep but that's exactly what you pay for a cheep fail on you ASAP type gun. I went to lock and load and got my gun and that place is the best I've been to in vegas in a long time so take what I've said for what you want but I think you need to know this,0
"this is a good store , they make good drinks and the people are very nice. the workers from the restaurant next store are always sitting at the tables outside the entrance by the pick up counter making it so other guests can not relax at the tables. would have given another star but every time i get my drink there is whip cream on it even thou i tell them no whip. i see them taking it off for people at drive up  also so they are just like robots and put the drink together like Starbucks says.",2
I went to see if they could do a brake check at 425pm on Monday and was told they didn't have time and that I would have to come back. Even if they did it and I needed them they couldn't do it now (which I could have understood). But to not even be able to check them when you don't close for another hour is ridiculous. You lost a customer who went somewhere else and spent $$.,1
"OMG this place is sooo cute!!! By far the best coffee I've ever had, ask for a fredo cappuccino. The strawberry ice cream is my fav. The staff is so friendly and welcoming. I'm definitely coming back.",4
Close to home... First time trying Sushi and it was excellent!!! Small place but worth it..\nTo go is just as good as well!!!,4
"This is some funny shit - definitely go see it! Knights of the round table, Killer bunnies, gay discos, Broadway and Jews, songs about songs, SPAM?! i honestly have no idea what the story line of this show is, but i highly recommend it.\n\ni liked it so much that i went to the gift shop and bought a pair of boxers for $18 that reads: \""I FART IN YOUR GENERAL DIRECTION!\""",4
"Salon: My star rating was based on the salon\nMy friend had a gift card for the Four Seasons so during our trip to Scottsdale, we decided to use it at the Salon to get our nails done. We got an appointment on Saturday morning, I called beforehand to make sure they have gel/shellac manicures available. I sat in a weak massage chair, but enjoyed the warm neck pillow she placed around me. I asked if she could do a french manicure and she hesitated but said yes. As she was putting my hands in the UV, I noticed that the white polish was starting to bubble at the tips, I pointed it out to her and she said that's happened before, I assume its because there was air flowing through the UV lamps, which I've never experienced before. \nOnce the last coat was on and under the light, it was time for the salt scrub. I was excited at the thought that I would get my hands and arms scrubbed, but disappointed when she asked me to do it myself and then she spent about 30 seconds rubbing my hands. No lotion, no massage, nothing. My friend was still getting her nails done so I left to go use the sauna. ONE DAY LATER, my at least $105 manicure (It was $85 for the gel and another $20 for the french!!) started PEELING UP!!! It's now been 4 days and I've had 4 fingers start peeling and was able to just peel the entire gel polish. I pay $40 in Santa Barbara and it lasts up to 3 weeks! For paying over $100, this manicure was worthless. \n\nPool: \nMy friend and I mentioned to our manicurists about wanting to go to the pool there and they said that we couldn't because the pool was only open to spa guests. We were disappointed as we wanted to spend the afternoon there and thought the salon counted. We went into the well stocked locker room and changed into our suits anyways and went to check it out. Whoa! We walked right in without needing a key card. No one asked us anything as we found a couple lounge chairs and laid out. The friendly poolside staff, brought us a pitcher of water and towels. We ordered lunch a couple hours later, and when they asked our room number, we told him we were guests of the spa and were going to pay cash. We had the chicken panini and jalapeno hummus. They were both great! Throughout the afternoon the poolside staff brought treats for everyone including rice crispy treats, dibs ice cream and otter pops! Perfect things for a hot day.",1
"Cold, under done chips. If a Mexican food restaurant can not get this staple right how can I expect them to get much more right.  I arrived for a party that my autocross group was having. Every table had chips and salsa on it. Sombreros were used as the server platters. Senor I don't think this even meets health code. \n\nDinner was served Buffet Style, one of the dishes was called \""fandito.\"" I can't think of a less inspired dish. It was simple pasta with some Mexican flavors thrown it, a dish that your mother would make if she had leftovers from Mexican Italian nights. \n\nI like really like Mexican food, however I left this place hungry as I did not even want to try any of the dishes other than the salad.",0
"This was our first time going, despite having lived right around the corner for a couple years. Was surprised to see how big it was inside. Always thought it was more of a hole in the wall, but it's quite expansive inside. Nice enough decor.\n\nOur server (Chuy) was great, but the bar was slow making our drinks. It wasn't busy, so I was perplexed. I had a beer, practically impossible to screw up, and my partner had the Mojito Mexicano. I hate mojitos, but as a bartender, I knew it was a good drink. Was on the stronger side, too. Which is NEVER a problem!\n\nDO order the guacamole fresca. Our server made it table side, and it was exactly the way I like my guacamole, fresh and creamy. YUM! I'll be back for this reason alone. \n\nWe both ordered the Baja Fish Tacos. They didn't look that delicious, but they were pretty damned tasty. Lots of tilapia inside. Usually I have no problem downing a order of three, but had to pack one up. The beans and rice served with it were yummy as well. Everything was piping hot, which is a pet peeve of mine. Points for that. \n\nAll in all, I'm excited to return and try some of their other dishes.",3
Owner was cool,4
Waiting for shuttle !!! Head to airport soon..was a good stay at this hotel ..cuz we got a cheap package with air n hotel $130 for 4 days..the room was in the tower 1..was old nut clean..very big compared to the newer rooms..,2
"Chen & Wok gets four starts for convenience, price and they deliver!!!  And it's Chinese food that's actually delivered in the Chinese take out boxes.  I love that.\n\nC &W is located on the NE corner of 7th Street and Maryland in a strip mall.  It's a little lunch counter type place full of pink and orange formica.  The interior has NO character at all, seriously, just call and have them deliver.  The people who own it are nice and prompt.  \n\nThey'll do white meat chicken for a dollar extra on any order.  Everything comes in pints or quarts.  A pint is enough for 1.5 servings and a quart is good for 3 to 4 servings.  The pints are a great way to get a few things and try.  Everything is super reasonably priced, most pints are $4 to 6.  Steamed white rice comes with every thing.  Their egg rolls are good, I think they have a little hoisin sauce in them, which is different but good.\n\nDon't get me wrong, this isn't Chinatown fabulous, but it's great in a pinch when you're busy.  You can spend $10 and get dinner for two delivered in 30 minutes.  And a bonus, I've NEVER had an ordered delivered that wasn't correct.  That's saying something.\n\nConfucius say, \""Don't dis Chen & Wok\"".",3
"If you have amazing tits or a douchey hat, you will good service.\n\nSomeone carved Cenpho.TV into one of the tables.\n\nThat someone was me.\n\nBeing a huge fan of dive bars, I feel like I should enjoy this place more. \n\nI don't.\n\nI love my crew though.\n\nLove is a battlefield. Hell is for children. Don't stop believin'.",2
Avid yelpers....My husband and I saw the 844 averaged 4 star reviews and tried this place out. Yelp led us astray. It was absolutely terrible. TERRIBLE! We had the ceviche which was OK...then everything got progressively worse. I had the tacos- crane asada and pork. The carne asada was inedible- I literally had to keep spitting out bits of meat because they were so chewy. The pork was so dry I could barely choke it down. Handmade corn tortillas didn't help- so dry. Cheese quesadilla was bland and served cold. My husband ordered the torta- terrible quality bread- most of his meat was in edible and lacking in flavor. We were hopefully but this was The worst $50 we have ever spent. Spare yourself!,0
"Went here with my boyfriend and his daughter because his co-workers raved about it...Either we cam on a bad night or their tastes in food is whack.  Anyway, was so excited when my boyfriend said they had these awesome (sounding) Grilled Cheese sandwiches.  I chose the bacon and pear.  My boyfriend got a burger and so did his daughter.  We also the the app with all the diff fried veggies.  For drinks I got an Angry Orchard cider (wanted a heff but server said they don't have any... really??) My boyfriend go some other cider thing. and then since it was Sunday and their Bloody Mary's were $5, I decided to have one of those too (it was a rough day).\n\nSo let's start with the app.  Most of the veggies and cheese curds were pretty good (pickles, green beans, not sure about the Okra because I don't like it, but the BF and his daughter ate 'em.  The corn fritter things tasted like corn and raw pancake batter on the inside.  Some of the smaller cheese curds were like rubber.  The spicy aoli was good, the taziki was whack.  It was not smooth with chunks of cucumber or just smooth is was like they put the cukes in a food processor and threw them in a cup.  It was just weird.\n\nThe cider was good and so was the ale/cider thing my bf got.  the Bloody Mary was horrible.  Mix was thin and watery (f it was a mix) didn't have that \""zing\"" to it, just blech.\n\nThe Food.  The server said they cook their burgers \""pink\"" in the middle and that is how he likes them.  Nope, well done.  Secondly, his buns were BLACK like completely burnt.  Who lets that get out of the kitchen, huh?  They do.  His daughters was very dark too, but she was hungry so she just ate it that way, he asked for diff buns.  My grilled cheese.  First off, it was toasted bread.  Not yummy, buttery, crispy, crunchy deliciousness you expect from a grilled cheese.  No oozing cheese (supposed to have Brie, Blue Cheese and Cheddar) no brie, no blue.  I asked the manager(?) when he brought out my bf's plate with new buns and asked him about the cheese conundrum.  I opened the sandwich and told him to look.  He says, \""there is a some blue cheese right there (it was the size of the tip of pencil lead).  He also told me that they don't put a lot of brie or blue because they are very strong and pungent cheeses.  Brie is strong and pungent???  And yes, blue is and I love it, so I want the flavors come out in the sandwich.  That grilled cheese was $9.00! I was very very dissapointed.  I make WAY better grilled cheese and it doesn't cost me $9.00.  The waffle cut fries were gross but I DID love their sweet potato fries, and they did taste homemade.  Service was great!  The bill was almost $70.00 for that crap, never again.  Even his daughter said she didn't want to come back and she isn't a food snob like my bf and I.  Sorry Spokes on Southern, looks like you gotta flat.",1
"How can you not like this place?  Sure taco Tuesday can be crazy, but how can it not be for that kind of deal? Bartenders are attentive and always ready with a suggestion and a cold beer. Definitely check it out.",4
Went there for my birthday brunch because I had read some good reviews so I thought it would be good.  Man was I wrong. The food to forever to get there the wait staff ignored us the whole time.  The food was cold the pancakes where stale and hard. The coffee was even bad. The worst part is when we complained they didn't even ask if we wanted the food remade or seemed to even care about the quality of the food.  Don't waist your time with this place.,0
Got our waters.....waited for 15 minutes for our waitress named miss eve or eva supposively the best according to the hostess and we had.to leave never came back on a non busy night. First and last time here.... Oh well,0
Checked in on a Friday afternoon for a one night visit. \n\nPros: \nearly checkin was FREE before 1\nComfy clean beds. Not too fluffy pillows. \nGood location\nLots of dining choices\nSO many places to drink beer\nNice view from strip view room\nPool was fun\nGood AC\nRoller coaster \n$50 beverage credit! How did I get that??\n\nCons:\nShade at the pool comes w/ a cost. \nLongest hallways ever. Good luck finding your room if you're drunk. \nThe non-stop flushing of our toilet. Had to jiggle the little ballcock (hehe) thing every flush so basin would fill. Eww. \nNo mall type place like Caesars or PH,3
"I don't see the hype surrounding this place. My friends and coworkers are obsessed so I've had both the lunch and dinner menu and I'm sorry to say the emperor has no clothes. I'm not a picky eater and don't expect perfection, just better than what I'm going to do at home if I'm paying $15+ a dish. \n\nFor lunch I had the jerk curry chicken bowl. I am a huge curried chicken fan, being of West Indian descent, so I was excited to try this dish. The curry didn't taste like much of anything and the boneless chicken was overcooked and tough. If you make your curried chicken right, the meat should be very tender and infused with the curry flavors. \n\nThe night after a different group wanted to go for dinner. We had the plantain app, it had chunks of salt in the sauce that took away from the flavor of the cooked plantain.  I shared the garlic chicken on bowties pasta, cornbread, and Mac and cheese with ruffle oil, bacon, and mushroom w my friend. Again, the chicken was tough, though this sauce ok. The cornbread was inedible! Omg I don't even know how it was made to taste like that but it was not good. The mac and cheese, which is a side, was better than the main dish but not a reason for me to return. We also had the red velvet cake which was very pretty to look at but dry AND turned our tongues/mouths red after a few bites from the dye used - I know that's how the red coloration is obtained but I've never been dyed by this type of cake before. \n\nOverall it's a cute place to go for people watching and a drink (I didn't have any but again friends raved) but I will not be returning anytime soon nor will I bring visitors. I'll go if friends want to go and hopefully will find a well made dish worth the $14-$22 (not bad if it was good) but otherwise  I will be avoiding this place. I'm very surprised at the food quality here because so many picky people I know love it.. Maybe DW is banking on the majority of people not being familiar with Caribbean cooking and therefore able to get away with mediocre efforts but if you are then you will quickly see through the smoke (of the kitchen?! JK!).",0
"I had visited this place for the first time due to a fundraiser for the organization, UNLV Circle K International. Both me and my friend weren't that hungry so we each got a custom shake and shared the \""Best of Both\"" which was fries and onion rings. \n\nThe custom shake i got contained oreos, cookie dough, and white chocolate. I had ordered the regular size so it came in the metal container they used to make it in. Decent size. Flavors were good and lots of cookie dough. Though for some odd reason, it tasted a bit sweeter than i had preferred. My friend had gotten pineapple and ?????. Not as sweet. Tasted pretty good actually. \n\nWhen the fries and onion rings came. It was eh. Reason for that is because the fries were unevenly sized so some burned during the frying process while some were good. I hope they dont expect people to eat the burnt crispy ones. T_T we had ordered the horseradish dipping sauce too. waiter said it was good with the onion rings. i didnt taste any horshradish at all. disappointing. ketchup and their special seasoning (strong in black pepper and whatever seasoning that gave the sour taste) was better. \n\nA lot of my friends had gotten burgers (ranging from 1/4 lb to 1lb to even the 2lb). the 1/4 lb and the 1 lb looked decent. Good thing about this place is you can almost add any topping on there.  Reason why i said it looked decent was (refer to my picture of the 2lb)... that looks almost disgusting. Then again, 2lb of ground meat is kind of hard to cook together... \n\nSome people were complaining about some smell but i had not smelled anything until later in the night. One of my friends had ordered their 1lb burger late (they came late) and the burger had passed by me. I had smelled this disgusting smell. One of my other friends believe its the cheese but i highly highly doubt it. Melted swiss cheese does NOT give that kind of smell. Or rather almost any melted cheese. Me and my friend who didnt eat much came to the hypothesis about either it being unfresh meat or some odd seasoning or way it was cooked that made it produce such a smell. Once i had smelled it, i actually was happy i didnt have much of an appetite earlier and order a burger. \n\nNo one complained about the taste so i guess the taste was good, which was the reason i had not put this at 1 star. The onion rings were decent as well as the fries, aside from the burnt pieces. Most of the burgers looked decent aside from the 2lb one that looked like it was falling apart. \n\nIf u were to ask me if i were to come here again, for the shakes, maybe. But for the burgers, most likely not. \n\nBut pricing, here's to give you an idea for the outrageous sized ones. \n\n1lb - $12\n2lb - $20",1
Went here for a bachelor party and had a decent time. Strange setup as there is a large downstairs area as well as two average sized outdoor spaces at this pub. \n\nDidn't try the food but others expressed that they liked it. \n\nIt's directly across from a Quality/Comfort Inn with balconies so that can provide some entertainment if you're sitting out front.,2
"I like the burgers here they are prepared fresh and to order , but they are messy as f@&$ !!! Don't go here if you are wearing your good clothes cuz chances are they we will be ruined !! ( or smell like peanut oil , when you leave ) seriously the amount of toppings you get ( or choose from ) is enormous !! The meat is cooked all the way thru and lightly seasoned , the bun is spongy and fresh , but by the time the burger is wrapped and toppings added it barely holds everything in , as for fries they are cooked to order as well and freshly cut , you can get them Cajun style , but recommend the seasoning on the side , because they can get a bit over zealous in it's application , so much so that they become too spicy to eat . As fries go , some are soft and flimsy others are crisp little potato nuggets , but they are fresh cut and that's to be expected ! They do have a wonderful soda machine that let's you create your own soda creation , mine is diet cherry peach fanta !! Lol , I would give a five star , but the smell after you leave there lingers , ( and stays in your car , if you get order to go ) it's definitely not an every day meal , but maybe about every 6 weeks or so the craving for a messy - have to wash your hands twice type of burger hits !!",3
"I am great fan of large open spaces and the Meadows fits that bill. Summer softbal practice? Check! Barbeque with friends? Check. Jogging? Check! Dog friendly? Great for families? School trips? Triple check!\n\nThere are times that they host a circus or a foodie festival and charity events. This place has it all and it is so easy to get to as many buses from the City come close. Though it is only a 15 -20 min walk from Princes Street. \n\nThis park is good for every season, but I prefer a good picnic in the summer.",3
The staff was rude and the wifi is useless.,0
"I really wanted to check this place out but like a lot of things it didn't live up to the hype.   The club that it's attached to, Moon, is normally, too crowded and seemed like an afterthought rather than a vision.   I don't like it here; however, the view of the strip from the outdoor patio is fantastic. \n\nAdvice:\n  Here's a tip if you're getting there late; especially on off nights.\nThere will be a point when you'll pay to get into the Playboy Club/Moon and you can get into the Ghost Bar for free and visa versa.  ie.  Sunday night at 1:30 am you pay 30 bucks to get into the Playboy Club/Moon and show your stamped wrist and they'll let you into the Ghost Bar for free.  Well, if you go to the Ghost Bar, same thing, you'll be able to get into the Playboy Club/Moon for free...only you'll pay 20 bucks to get into the Ghost Bar.",1
"Great location & hours, for those of us in Uptown early, or even a mid-day snack. Service is good and the options are awesome! I love the Strawberry-Banana Smoothie! A definite alternative to some of the other morning, snack options.",3
"Dr Roach is amazing!  He is thoughtful, kind and clearly loves working with our furry family. I am grateful to Dr Roach and his staff for their quick, compassionate care.  I have definitely found my new vet.  I would highly recommend West Russell Animal Hospital!",4
"Um this place rocks..... Walking in to view the magic butchery of their open kitchen is in itself a sometimes jaw dropping experience, then the food beautiful but its not about it being dressed up. Its not, its simply fantastic, Duck in a Can - is genius - highest quality ingredients anyone could hope consume and then have a CVA over. I aspire to revisit whenever in Montreal... Seriously a must, and a much more fun atmo than L'Express ....",4
"Our group had a great time at the 21+ night. Everything was open to us and we had a great time with all of the exhibits.\n\nThe one thing that I would change would be the availability of beverages. As it was, it was difficult and time consuming to get drinks. A little more availability of this would be what made this event awesome",2
"I have been to Basil twice now in two weeks, both times it has been\ndelicious.  My first interaction with the hostess was not very pleasurable,\nI went into the restaurant at 1120a and they didn't open till 1130a. Gasp.\nI wanted to sit down, grab a glass of wine and read Creative Loafing and wait for my girlfriend.  Let me just say I was denied access. \n\n I know I have a lot of nerve showing up so early and before anyone explains to me the inner workings of a restaurant, I supported myself, full time, non-stop as a waitress for twenty years.  Let's just say good thing the food was delicious or I would have not been back.  Finally when the hostess saw fit to sit the now three tables at the door, she walked me to my table. \n\n I sat down and ordered a glass of Prosecco, it came a little flat, I thought,  BOOOOO, but I couldn't complain, it would just be in bad form.  I drank my flat sparkling, I have had worse.  We started with basil rolls and chicken Larb.  The basil rolls were fresh and the dipping sauce was the perfect sweetness with a tiny kick of spicy chile paste.  I have only had Chicken Larb served chilled like a salad, this Larb,  the chicken was freshly cooked and served room temperature. Larb is usually a meat concoction of mint leaves, chili, onion, rice powder\nin lime juice and fish sauce.  We also shared some chicken red curry, it was great, how can you go wrong with coconut milk and red curry?   \n\nMy second visit I went at a more suitable hour of 1p, so I didn't get any\nlip from the hostess.  We had basil rolls again, shrimp fried in egg roll\nwrappers and Pad Thai, everything is fresh and the heat index is perfect, you can ask for chili sauce and make dishes as spicy as you like.  I love this restaurant, I think I would go on off hours or weeknights or expect a wait, the restaurant only sits about 75 people. It is priced reasonable at lunch, with a bottle of wine our bill for two was $60, half of that was the wine.  If you haven't eaten Thai food, I would recommend going with two or more people so you can order a lot of food and try a lot of different items.\n\nSo far, everything I have had has been off the charts fresh and scrumptious.  I feel like everyone is allowed to have a bad day, maybe I could make sure I am really nice next time I go in there, maybe she won't remember me as that customer that came in too early.  I would rather be known as that lady who drinks at 1132a.\n\nBasil Thai gets a 3 corndog rating.",3
"Superbowl Sunday review only:\n\nIt was exciting to see some flare, but it was not as crazy as I think it might be, cuz this place was PACKED and a little insane.\n\nDrinks are strong, and big enough for vegas, and this bar is outdoors (awesome) and feels a little old, but it's a nice change from the glitz and glam.\n\nThat said, it was a little too crowded and crazy, and we had to leave to walk down the strip after kickoff since we were being given some mean stares by some patrons trying to keep open seats for their purses. Grrr.",2
"The phrase uttered most at The Quad this past weekend was \""Surely, it can't get worse than this.\"" The phrase that was uttered ALMOST as often was \""Good God...I hate this place.\"" I was far from the only person with these mantras.\n\nI saw mold growing in places I once thought not possible. It would be more impressive if it wasn't where I was living.\n\nThe view outside our window reminded me of the slums of Hong Kong, but that's a story for another day.\n\nThe smell. The smell - it was everywhere. It reminded me of the Axe bodyspray fights in the locker room in middle school but almost as if someone decided to bring chlorine to the fight.\n\nI also had the pleasure of encountering vomit multiple times throughout my stay. Whose vomit? Not sure - could have been there for awhile for all I know.\n\nAnyway...don't stay here.",0
This is a fair-sized store. It is clean and well-stocked. I found a pair of great chairs in good condition for way less then I would have paid elsewhere. And supporting Goodwill is a nice bonus. I'd reccommend stopping here before trying a more upsale resale store.,3
My last three apointments at this dealer were an horrible experience.\nI dropped of my car on all three appointments on a wednesday or thursday morning and I was promised that I would have it returned within the same day or latest the following day. Since I am depending on my Vehicle to commute this was very important to me and I made it each time very clear to the service person.\nAt the first service I had received a call on wednesday/thursday and then on friday again to be told that it takes longer than expected and I could pick it up the following day but they would give me a call as soon it was done. \nSaturday around 12pm I called in to see what the status was. I havent heard from anyone since the day before and I was told on the phone that they are alreay closed for the day and I could come by to pick up my car Monday morning. \nSince I was supposed to drive to rocky point that same day this option wasnt working for me so I had to drive to the dealership and had to make a scene for an hour to get my car back just to find out they havent done anything to it in three days :-/\n\nThe other two times happend within several momths I had again the same experience as the first time. \nWhy they keep on promising the return of  the car if they cant deliver this promise is beyond me?!!\n\nAnyways what made me write this post was another disapointment I had last week at my third appointmnet. \nI turned it in wednesday for an alligment and replacement of some parts around my tires. Again I was promised to pick it up the same day by five and again I had to wait until the following day 5 o'clock. \nSomehow I wasnt supprised anymore since I kind of expected this kind of treatment. \nWhat took the cherry of the cake was this. \nThe next day I noticed that my 12Volt plugs at my car aint working anymore.I figured that it just blew out a fuse and drove back to the dealership to check it quick out for me.\n\nThey took my car in and made us wait for about 30min.When they returned my car they said that there were some blown out fuses but they exchanged it and it still doesn't work. Since it was already 5:30pm on a friday night they suggest we should make an appointment to drop of my car to check the whole electric on it since it seemed to pick very strange........ok here we go again\n\nOn the weekend i deceided to check out the fuse box my self before I return back to the dealer ship. And I was shocked to see that all the magic it took to make my plugs work again was to plug in two 15amp fuses that somehow werer missing in the spot !!\nReally???\n\nFor me this was the last time I will ever visit this dealer ship and I recommend anyone to do same.,0
"I made a reservation for 14 people. They set us up for a spot for 10 people. 2 of us had to sit at different table and rest of us were uncomfortably smashed together. When asked to sit at a different location, management said no without giving an excuse and didn't seem to care.\n\nBefore making the reservation, I asked if the parking validation is for the full day. I was informed by two different people that on Saturday, it would be validated for the day. When time to leave the parking deck, the ticket was validated for only 3 hours. The entire party had to pay for parking, when informed it was validated for the entire day. I called to complain and the hostest would only say \""it's just 3 hours\"" repeatedly. She didn't apologize or seem to care. Horrible customer service.",0
Subs are good.  I think Jersey Mikes is better by far.  Ordering is confusing.  There is a person standing up front and you have to order somewhere else.  Found myself talking to someone but not really ordering.  Subs did not blow me away with flavor.  I could most likely make a better one.,2
"Worst shopping experience EVER!  I went in to get a new harness for my dog.  Not knowing what size he needed, we sit on the floor to try a couple on.  Employees taking inventory literally trampled us.  No pause for me to move, no excuse me, I had to make sure I wasn't wearing my invisibly cloak again. When I said something to them, they did not even acknowledge me.  \n\nOnce I found the right harness and found some other things I needed, I went to the checkout where things got worse.  The clerk was surly at best, impossibly rude even.  I walked out of there feeling terrible, and my dog, who loves to go shopping when he's allowed, was so depressed that not one staff member even acknowledged his presence.  Have you ever had to deal with a depressed dog with self esteem issues?  It took several cookies and 3 rides in the car to make him feel better!\n\nWhile I still think Petco over all has decent selection and prices, the people at this store are what got them a single star.  I will probably end up giving them a second chance in the future, and hopefully the experience will be different.",0
"Had my eyes set on Teppanyaki for months, and finally made a visit with a couple of friends.  I love Japanese food, and it's great to have options that are not limited to just Sushi/Sashimi and the miso soup.\n\nFood (8.5/10) = I got hella excited when I visited and ordered quite a few dishes for a party of 3.\n\n1) Okonomiyaki = The Chinese have scallion pancakes. The Koreans have seafood pancake.  The Japanese have Okonomiyaki.  These are pancakes made of flour, eggs, vegetables, proteins, and topped with bonito flakes, served with a mayonnaise based sauce.  There are several options for proteins.  We got the Osaka Mix which includes shrimp, squid, and beef.  The dish can be shared or can be large enough for entree sized satisfaction.  I felt the Okonomiyaki was done well, and would definitely order again.\n2) Squid and King Oyster Mushrooms sauteed in white garlic sauce (from the Autumn menu) = One aspect I enjoy with Japanese food is the simplicity of some dishes, and letting the ingredients speak for itself.  This was one of those dishes.  The squid was cooked very well, which many Asian restaurants tend to screw up by overcooking it and making it tough.  The oyster mushrooms were amazing.  This was my favorite dish of the night.  Unfortunate that this dish is seasonal.\n3) Korokke (curry flavor) - chopped veggies with mashed potato rolled in wheat flour, eggs, breadcrumbs, then deep fried.  Absolutely loved this.  A great vegetarian option.  The curry essence was not overwhelming.  I thought about ordering another one during my visit...as a dessert, heh.\n4) Takoyaki (octopus balls, dumplings made of batter and filled with diced octopus) = Classic.  Whenever I see this at a Japanese restaurant, I order it.  \n5) Agedashi Tofu (cubed tofu deep fried served with tentsuyu and topped with scallion and grated daikon) = Like Takoyaki, I gravitate towards this dish if it's on the menu.  Another simple dish, but so damn delicious when done well.  The tofu is soft with a thin crispy exterior.  The flavor of the sauce is light and clean.\n6) Bacon with Japanese Mochi = A unique dish for me.  Never a pig on mochi before until I came here.  Decided to try it since it was one of the more popular dishes mentioned on Yelp.  I wasn't impressed with the dish.  I usually love anything involving pork belly, but for some reason this dish was meh.    \n7) Yaki-Soba noodles = My vegetarian friend got this since she had a hard time finding something on the menu that was vegetarian friendly.  This dish was meh according to her, and it looked meh to me as well.  The dish was at least 30% onions.  Although she ordered the dish with just vegetables, 30% onions is disappointing.  \n8) Black sesame ice cream = I like black sesame anything with Asian breads or desserts.  The flavor was great, but the texture was not ice cream texture.  It was instead similar to mochi.  Stretchy.  We didn't order the mochi dessert.  Perhaps there was mix up with our order.  Who knows.\n\nNote to vegetarians: This place didn't seem to have many vegetarian friendly dishes.  There are dishes you may think are vegetarian, such as the Agedashi tofu.  The issue with some of these dishes is the use of fish stock.  Hence my friend was limited to the Yaki-Soba with 30% onions and the Korokke.\n\nAmbiance (8.5/10) = The decor was very inviting.  A lot of elements of wood/bamboo.  There are lanterns, and the place is well lit.  Very spacious, very clean, with several private booths in the back.\n\nService (8.0/10) = Timely, and not overbearing.  Our waiter was nice, and provided great recommendations, such as the Squid and King Oyster Mushroom dish.\n\nOverall opinion = Definitely a winner if you enjoy Japanese food.  The Japanese food scene (non-Sushi type Japanese restaurants) is minimal in Pittsburgh, but at least there is one good one - Teppanyaki Kyoto.  I recommend the first 5 dishes I listed above.  The rest were just meh.",3
"I get it- but I don't get it.  Let me explain..We went on a busy Sunday morning and asked if we could sit outside. We were told to pick any table but the problem is that all of them had not been cleaned since the last customer.  We sat at a table with someone's leftovers for about 10 minutes and no one came out to bus the table.  When I went back in to speak with the hostess, I told her we had moved to a less dirty table.  Once we sat down at our new table, I knew it would be an interesting meal.  I swear we were sitting right next to the Real Housewives of Charlotte.  Each woman had downed a bottle of wine and their conversation was very loud and obnoxious.  Then, my mimosa came out with what looked like a pubic hair hanging off of the side - yum.  The food was fine but it was nothing to write home about.  Like I said before - I get it, but I don't get.  This place has a lot of potential but I could not deal with the type of people that choose to dine here.",1
Just give it a try. Anything I say will not do it justice. A perfect special occasion go to. This place will be on top for a very long time.,4
"FOOD WAS HORRIBLE! why didn't i listen to the reviews on Yelp? Im stubborn and wanted to give this place a try. All of their food tastes just like their strawberry chicken. was it really all strawberry chickens made to look like beef, pork.. wonton.. etc? maybe they mass produced this -said, strawberry chicken and masked it to look like other items on the menu. whatever. shitty food. good luck.",0
"This place is OK. It is the place for people who don't live in Lawrenceville to go when they come to check out Lawrenceville. \n\nIn off hours Industry is decent with lots of beers, average pub fair and good service. However, when this place is busy the volume level is deafening and the \""tourists\"" are annoying as hell and you might as well be on the Southside. \n\nIn short... Go for a beer when it is quite and bail as soon as the crowds start to arrive.",1
"Got the Spicy Burger and a fry, no drink.  Total was $9.60.  The burger was ok, but for that price it should have been fantastic.  The fries were underdone.  I like mine crispy.  Since Create closed I figured I should give this place a try.  I will not be back.\n\nWow that was a little harsh. I have been back, many times. Even though it's a little pricey it is quality. Love the fried pickles. Seems less busy too. Hope it's doing well.",3
"This place is hilarious! We went with family. My cousins step mom was trying to make sure to include her boyfriend in holiday fun since he is vegan and she did not realize that there was a difference between raw and vegan food. Understandable mistake. Everyone was totally willing to try something new BUT this place is like a bad episode of Portlandia. \n\nThe menu sounded ok. We were told to sit and the chef would come around and tell us what on the menu we were studying was available for the day. We said ok and started reading the extensive menu. We ordered some tea. The lemon one was great but the Hibiscus tea my cousin and I ordered tasted like we were licking the earth. It was disgusting. So we asked if we could just trade it out for the lemon or if she could just take them away. The server seemed nervous and said she would ask the chef. She came back without asking the chef and said that she would fix the problem by putting coconut sugar in it. We tried it and let her know that it was still just not our cup of tea. FINALLY she agreed we could switch teas. \n\nAt this point we had been sitting for about 20 minutes waiting for the famous chef to let us know what we were allowed to order off of the menu. Still no sign of her except to ask if the door open was making us cold. We decided to pay for our teas and cut our losses. If you have a craving for raw food, the desire to be in cave creek, and 4 hours to kill this might be the place for you. I will stick with cooked vegan food at Green or Braggs Factory Diner.",1
"I dub Big Ern's the first place I've grubbed at in the Container Park. Pricing is a little steep but considering the tastiness of the food, I'll accept it. The place is extremely small, perhaps fitting around 10 or less people in the seating area.  There are seats out on the patio, but it was about 40 degrees outside when I went.\n\nThe girl who rang me up kept on looking at me like she was annoyed with what I was ordering. I was glad I was wearing sunglasses because we could've had a terrible stare-down competition. \n\nBesides the service being weird or rude--or whatever you would categorize it as--I had a lovely BBQ chicken sandwich. The chicken was a little on the dry-side, but I looooved the bbq sauce that came on it. I am usually a hater of bbq sauces because they usually over power my taste buds. But this sauce actually complimented the chicken well.  \n\nThe only critique of the sandwich was that the bun was cold and it would have been TOTALLY awesome if it was warm and toasted. But hey, what can I do?\n\nMy dude got the two meat combo with sausage and brisket. He said he liked it. So I snuck a piece of his brisket and it was indeed tasty but a little dry. \n\nOverall the experience was underwhelming. I won't NOT come back, because I think the sauce they use is fantastic. However, I don't see myself as a frequenter.",2
"Here's why Dizzy's rocks.. \n\nBrandy and Jasmine just kick ass as bartenders and know how to take care of their customers.  You will never go thirsty!  We like to meet up here every so often and hang with our friends for hours here.  We end up just drinking, singing to the juke box and playing darts. For a small bar, this place really is the sh*t.\n\nIm not really the bar type, but my girlfriend turned me on to this place and I just keep coming back.  Awesome people, awesome times.  Dizzy's is the place!  \n\nWhy not 5 stars??  Im always the designated driver, and when it comes to soda, they only serve Coke products.. ewwwww...   then again, Ive never heard of someone asking for a \""Rum N Pepsi\"" before.  So yes.. 1 star is for my diet pepsi!!  :)",3
"Outrageous!  For upgrading to the $99 I took my Xterra home to finish the $25 job they started.  I could go to great length about the bugs and road tar that were supposedly waxed over.  There was oily product running down every rubber and plastic part inside and out; where and if anything was done at all.  The back third of the interior was completely ignored.  The colourful foam from the wash left rainbow stripes next to the remaining crud in most of the door jams.  I get better result in minutes with a vacuum and cheap drive through wash.  After asking if they really were finished, I was basically lied to about all the fore-mentioned.  At that point I just held out my hand disappointed and waited for my keys.  I should have demanded a refund since I obviously wasn't going to see results.",0
"After reading many reviews of this hotel, I was disappointed by the service of the staff and the accommodations.  It reminded me of the UK version of a Marriott, so nothing spectacular.\nThe first room we checked into was on the top floor and had a nice view east of the city.  However, the wind was howling and howling as soon as we set foot in the door and something in the roof/ceiling was banging.  I hate to do it but I knew I would never sleep through that so we requested to move to a lower floor.  The manager came up in about 10-15 minutes and brought us to our room on the 2nd floor which was unfortunately much smaller.  This was not ideal as we were on our honeymoon and would have liked a good size room; however, we did complain about the first so it was okay.\nThe next morning we woke up sweating as the heat had been left on (I guess by housekeeping) and it was very hot.  My husband went to turn the heat down, looked down at the knob and it was completely broken off of the heater.  We were on our way out so we stopped at the front desk and told them so that they could maintenance while we were out.  When we returned, no luck, still broken.  We called the front desk and requested maintenance again, again no luck.  This continued for the next 2 days,  again sweaty and hot all night long.  Yuck!\nMaintenance finally showed up the night before we were to leave and changed the valve/ knob in about 10 minutes.  But all that time we had waited really left a bad memory for us.  If the maintenance department was understaffed, I wish they would have moved us to a different room, or to their other location a few doors down.\n\nTo note:\n* do not mix up with the Apex City Hotel, which is a few doors down\n* careful getting out of the shower, its slippery and nothing to hold onto\n* great, central location to get to Old Town and touristy activities",2
"I went in at about 11pm on a Saturday and the line and waiting for order process was still about an hour long! It is also very pricey, and totally not worth it! I did receive a chocolate cake sample as I waited for my order, and it was actually very good but just everything I actually ordered was just average, I thought it was gonna be something like I've never tried before! Well it wasn't! I did want to try it, I did try it, and that would be the end of it! ;)",2
"I'm not sure if I came here with higher expectations because I had heard that this place was awsome but I thought it was just ok and barely that. When we walked there was no AC and it was around 110 that day so you can imagine how hot it was in a place where they are grilling up food. It was super uncomfortable to sit there and eat when your hot and sweaty. They had dusty old fans blowing that look like they hadn't been cleaned in years. The place has a very old dingy look and feel to it even from the outside. As for the food also just ok, nothing impressive. \n\nI have to say I did not try the burgers, I had a chicken sandwich and fries.",2
"Okay... I stay a a Westin or W at least 3 nights a week. I know these places... the service sucked. Even though all Starwood properties are smokefree.... people are still allowed to smoke in casinos. Freaking annoying. I have to get my hair and clothes smelling like smoke before I get my coffee. The waitress at the restaurant in the hotel was from NY - she was friendly and excellent. I had to wait 20 mins to get into my room... not because there was a line... but because no one was at the front desk.  I was charged a \""service fee\"" when I used points for my stay. (I fought the Westin... and I won..) Anyway... I wasn't impressed by this hotel.\nBut at least I didn't have Julius Cesare waking me in the morning.... like at that other hotel. Definitely much less cheese here.",1
"I've tried a number of Hawaiian restaurants in the valley and by far this is my favorite. The expectations of this place really lives up to the hype with everyone on yelp and word of mouth. Service was pretty standard the day we visited and there was a good sized crowd eating lunch. My mom and I brought the little girl we babysit throughout the week and we ordered fried poke stack, mahi mahi salad, and grilled chicken. \n\nFried Poke Stack- this had a really good flavor. I'm guessing it was cooked with sesame oil and soy sauce. The portion was plenty enough to share which is why my parents were able to taste it. My parents enjoyed this as well because they believed it had a very homemade like-taste to it. \n\nMahi Mahi Salad- really delicious dressing is all I can say. The only thing I would ask for is it would have been better if they used cherry tomatoes instead of slicing a tomato into quarters. But loved the dressing once again. \n\nGrill chicken- didn't get to try this because we ordered it for the little girl. But it came with three fillets. \n\nBanana bread- I was really excited to try this because Ursula U. had raved about it in her review. It was pretty good, but not the best that I've tried or anything I would crave for. It could be because it's made with Cinnamon, which is something I'm not a big fan of. \n\nTIP: everything is ENOUGH TO SHARE. Even if I'm a big eater, the portions here are huge!\n\nCan't wait to come here to try more. Absolutely love it and recommend to anyone no matter what side of town you live on especially if you're into Hawaiian food.",4
"Chips, Chips and more Chips! There chips and salsa are sooo good. Tacos are delish and price is reasonable for the amount of food you get. Plus they have Happy Hour taco specials.",4
"Came here for dinner with a few friends. AMAZING food. Great view of the strip. Outdoor seating is simply magnificent. Wine list is extensive and well selected.  Service was best in Vegas.. usually everyone knows your gonna go there and waste money so they are rude but, the Mon Ami Gabi staff was attentive and very respectful.\n\nMake reservations for sure.",4
Food is good but the wait for take out is always between 45 minutes to 1 hour. I might have to find some other place cuz this is the third time and I don't think 3rd time was the charm.,2
Tried it based on the reviews before me and I was not disappointed.  The food was simply delicious.\n\nI would go back without have any reservations.  \n\nThe place was BYOB as far as I could tell and the clientele was thoroughly enjoying the food.,3
the donuts are nothing special and the owner will treat anyone who appears to be left-leaning (politically) VERY poorly.,0
"They are usually very friendly and the restaurant is a very nice environment. However, the last couple of times I went in, it was very busy and the service and food was not that great.",2
One of the bright spots during our stay at the Luxor.\n\n5 star restaurant all the way.\n\nTip - \nTry the strawberry shortcake for dessert and the espresso martini as an after dinner drink. \n\nYUM O!,4
"What a delightful meal! Cabo is nestled into a quiet corner of Sunset Station Casino, and is furnished with beautiful and rustic Mexican decor. The menu has enough to satisfy any palate searching for a good Mexican dinner, but not so much as to overwhelm you. \n\nOur server was Daniel, and he was delightful. He was attentive, funny, knowledgable, and helpful. Truthfully, he is the main component of what made our dining experience so memorable.\n\nI couldn't decide between the chicken tamales and the chicken enchilada, so Daniel suggested I get the combo platter as to enjoy both! I did prefer the enchilada to the tamale, but both were great, filled with shredded chicken and topped with a mild green sauce. \n\nThe manager, Mike, even stopped by our table to insure we were having a good dining experience. I was so very impressed with service. \n\nI would definitely suggest Cabo. Go in and ask to be seated with Daniel!",4
"If you like to waste your money-shop here for ink cartridges!  Of course needing to get a printing project in the mail the next morning I ran out of ink. Thinking a quick trip to Office Max will take care of the issue, I'd quickly pick up the ink cartridges---I had purchased cartridges earlier this year from Amazon for $27 and Office Max charged $77!!  Needless to say I had to buy the cartridges from Office Max-from now on will order my cartridge sets from Amazon even if I don't need them immediately.",0
Ihop in Vegas....still ihop.,2
"Love this restaurant and the food is AMAZING!! my favorite is the three cheese mac n cheese.. BUT whenever I go on a Sunday and sometimes Saturday they tell me they don't have cookie dough for the giant cookies, and my food takes an extremely long time to come out and when I asked the server said \""well we ran out of the cheese sauce so we had to run to Safeway to buy some\"". Little odd.",2
"Really liking the vibe here.  I like how the bar and lobby start to blend with a full house.  It is definitely a cocktail joint and the beer on tap continues to grow.  Have been about twice a week since they opened.\n\nThe food offers a wide variety to choose from and I like that many of the apps and entrees are created for a sharing environment. I've worked my way thru the menu pretty quickly.  Here's some suggestions:\n\n*Starters*\nTater Tots\nDeviled Eggs\nWarm Mixed Nuts\nCitrus Olives\n\nRoasted Beets\nHeirloom Tomato Salad (Tasty, but 3 slices was not worth the price)\n\n*Main Dishes*\nMac N Chees\nShort Ribs \n   (The gravy boat dish is cool, but the rib needs to be cut into smaller pieces)\n\n*Dessert*\nCheese Cake with Tortilla Ice Cream\n   I'm not the biggest fan of dairy, but Tortilla Ice Cream is great!\n\nAll in all, I'm happy with the cocktails and apps at any hour.  You do pay for the upscale environment to be downtown, but I feel it's worth the experience.  The elevated view out of the windows is a spectacular over the city.\n\nThe biggest perk is you can head upstairs to Lustre's rooftop bar for a night cap.  You'll see a lot of the same staff working both bars.\n\nI recommend for anyone especially the Scottsdale crowd before catching a game",3
"Normally I love Del Taco, so I figured I would try out their breakfast burrito before a road trip up north. Bad call.\n\nFirst of all, I had to repeat my order three times. Breakfast burrito meal with coffee. Not a tough one, and no special order.\n\nWhen I get up to the window, the guy tells me they are out of hot coffee. WHA? It's 9am. However, he said they can give me an iced vanilla coffee instead. Sure, fine, whatever.\n\nI hand over my debit card and what do you know, they are charging me to use it. Great. I am now paying 23% more because they are cheap-scates.\n\nI get my bag of food and pull away, only to find out that I didn't get the meal.. I got a coffee and the burrito, but no hash brown sticks. BOO! Well, I am certainly not going back to try and explain myself, especially since I already scraped my tire trying to get closer to the window that is 5 feet away from the curb.\n\nOh, and to top it all off, the burrito and the coffee were gross.\n\nNo way, jose.",1
"Ordered a pomegranate martini, tasted like water & a very odd color.  The martini glass was chipped.  Had Nonna's pizza & it was delicious with a thin, crisp crust & wonderful flavors.  We ate dinner on the patio & it was filthy.  The whole area needs to be power washed, including the tables & chairs.  I think we should have ordered take out.",1
"I was super excited to visit this place and maybe built it up to high.  I had a coupon in the mail and waited weeks to use it!  I was excited to find a yakitori bar in Vegas after watching hours of No Reservations and Bizarre Foods.  I'm surprised to see all of the 5 stars for this place so maybe I missed something, but I thought it was mediocre at best.\n\nWe had a party of five and I was not overly impressed with any particular dish.  It was pretty pricey too, so the value really wasn't there.  We tried everything, and the bacon wrapped asparagus was the best thing (although it didn't compare to the ones I had at the night market in Taipei).  Bengal BBQ's bacon asparagus at Disneyland was even more memorable.\n\nThe skewers, yuzu salmon, beef tongue, koro steak...all okay, but honestly nothing too memorable.  Service and atmosphere was excellent and they're open late, but it was just ok to me.",2
"My son had strep throat and needed to get medication right away.  It was a Sunday and his doctor was not open.  Walk-ins Welcome.  Wait was a little longer than expected but excellent location and kind PA (Amy Pfister PA-C). Thank You. I also thought it was helpful that there was a pharmacy on-site,",3
"Clean and spacious. They have everything here. A great beer/wine selection (for a pharmacy), all the essentials and patio furniture. Seriously, everything.",3
5 Stars for sure! Awesome atmosphere a great wine bar/lounge without having to go all the way to scottsdale. If you are looking for a good chill time in chandler this is the place to be!,4
"I can't lie, I had overhyped this place in my mind after checking the reviews here at yelp.  The bone marrow roast and the lamb had me sold.  The Guinness pancakes were just the kicker.  It was ON!\n\nHowever, we went for Saturday brunch and neither the lamb nor the marrow were available at that hour and the guy behind the counter said that they don't do Guinness pancakes.  I was crushed.\n\nThat said, the food there was just fine, it just wasn't what I had hoped.  The variety of foods was impressive but I have to say that the selection within each food genre seemed kinda slim.  My favorite dishes were the prime rib-y thing and the kielbasa.\n\nFor dessert, as others have mentioned, look good, but there were no signs to suggest what each item is.  I was mighty full by the time I hit the dessert bar so, while I was quite impressed with the presentations, I statyed away fro most of ht pretty looking unknown treats.  I got a plate of berries and lemon gelato which was just light enough for my dessert.\n\nI have to also mention that I got the bottomless mimosas with the meal.  I had two mimosas and then moved to bloody Marys.  The bloody Marys were much better than the mimosas.\n\nThe ambiance was much nicer than those of the Rio World Buffet or the M Resort's Studio B buffet, but I have to say that I preferred the food at both the Rio and the M over Cosmo's Wicked Spoon.\n\nOne final note.  We had a large group, 16 people.  The manager was kind enough to allow two of us to line up while the rest of our group gathered (most of us had a late night).  After the pair reached the front of the line they gave us 15 minutes to gather our group and then they let us all right in, reserving a pair of cashiers to let us all pay individually.  After seating us, the initial response from our waitress seemed kind of annoyed and b*tchy, but after we figured everything out (drink orders and what not) the staff was extremely helpful and friendly.  I can't say I blame them for being initially annoyed at the confusion.\n\nIt was a good experience, and the food was good.  But I would be sure to check the food list before coming in, and honestly, I think I'm more inclined to check out some of the other buffets or returning to Studio B before coming back to Wicked Spoon.",2
"The St Germain martini is Awesome!! I loved the cauliflower app. My sandwich was just ok, but I would definitely go back and try something else.",3
"Worst. Haircut. Ever.\n\nI have a Yorkiepoo that has been getting her haircut for five years. She's had her fair share of hit or miss haircuts, but she's never gotten a haircut this bad. I showed the groomer a picture of what I wanted, but I guess it got lost in translation with all of the barking dogs in the back (read: I had to shout to be heard). My hubby picked up my dog so I didn't get a chance to examine her, but when she got back........oh no! Not only was the haircut different from the picture I showed the groomer, it was BAD haircut. \n\nThe whole haircut is choppy and uneven. The hair on her chest is much longer than her body and she has random longer hairs sticking out on her legs. Heck, half her body seems to be shaved closer than her other half!  My husband has done a better job at grooming my dog, it was that bad. My poor sad pup. Thankfully, she doesn't know any better. But I do. I'll never be coming back here again!\n\nI've included a few pics. My dog isn't the most photogenic, but I think it gets the point across.",0
"I am totally in love with Mandalay Bay.\n\nI went for the first time this past week for 4 days and 3 nights. The decor was sweet in the standard room and hallway with beige colors, and the bathroom was nice with both a stand-up shower and a soak-in tub. I heard it was a good hotel but I did not want to expect too much. I was blown away! For one, the slots were good to me on several occasions, as I played them every night. I put in $5 into a quarter machine and hit $400, the most epic win for me of all time thus far. To that end, MB will ALWAYS be dear to my heart. They also had a table game promo for buy-in $20 and get $30  in casino chips so that was fun. I played blackjack switch.\n\nIt's absolutely beautiful on the inside and out even more than any hotel I have seen in my past 3 trips to Vegas. It's bright and spacious with a South beach theme all throughout. Great for photo ops! The vibe is amazing and everyone at the table genuinely smiled and laughed while teaching me the difference between regular blackjack and blackjack switch. Great times.\n\nWe saw the Lion King here and it was just as ridiculously amazing here as it was when I saw it on Broadway in NY and London! It was full-length too unlike some broadway shows on the strip. I did not get to see all the wonderfully beautiful (in pics) restaurants nor did I get a chance to see Mandalay place (but my friend loved it) BUT I did see the POOL! In the words of my friend AMAZ-TASTIC! Yes, I would love to make Mandalay my Vegas home.",4
"I was introduced to Lakeside Street Coffee House a few months back by a co-worker. I read the reviews before arriving and learned they hosted a knitting night. I was sold. The location is great, there is a great view of the city from the outdoor patio of LSCH. It is well worth a trip just for that. The coffee is good and the iced tea is good. Those are the only two beverages I have had, but both were great. I typically get the iced tea of the day and have never been disappointed. I also usually get a scone, those too are good. \n\nWhile the food and drink have been good. It really is the location and ambience that do it for me. It is never crowded. Plenty of room to work alone or to meet a friend for coffee. It's welcoming, again, with a great view. There is a playground and swimming beach just out the back of the coffee house, and yes, parent's, you can take your coffee out to the beach. Just return the cup before you leave. :)",3
Went tonight for the second time in two months. The food is really good but their service is very slow. Be prepared to spend at least an hour waiting to get your food.,3
"We walked here from the Holiday Inn Midtown about a block away. We liked the sunny, bright  appearance inside, and the light classical music playing in the background. The menu had a nice variety of breakfast, brunch and lunch items, including interesting combinations in sandwiches, omelettes and crepes. We are vegetarians, and there were many optMy husband had an omelette with asparagus and Hollandaise sauce and I had banana crepes with chocolate sauce and a side of potatoes. Overall the food wasn't spectacular but it did what it set out to do--we had a pleasant meal and felt it was fresh and good for us--The portions were not huge, which to me is a good thing! Sizes of servings were really \""just right.\""\n\nWould I go back to Cafe Imagination? Maybe, but I'd rather find a place that knocks me over, considering all the choices there are in Montreal! Still, it did the job! Not a bad place by any means.",2
This hotel smells like a dirty bar that hasn't cleaned their pipes in years! For the amount of money this place makes they can at least make it smell nice. The only thing that saved this place for me was the house of blues and the foundation room.,1
Huge portions! One regular order lasts me three meals.\n\nI'll be coming back here to fulfill my bbq cravings.,3
"We tried this food truck at the festival South Point Casino held 11/5, we chose them because Diane is a vegetarian, we ordered vegetarian tacos they ask if we wanted them vegan , chorizo tacos, and sloppy tots. they were slammed with hundreds of customers so the wait was a bit but the food was excellent all freshly made there black beans were perfect and the Pico de gallo was fresh we will certainly be eating here again. I did not realise the chorizo was vegan till I picked up the order it was great.",3
"I don't care for Samurai Sam's based on the very few times I have visited. The food is sad, oily and the portions are skimpy for the price point. \n\nThis location was empty even during peak lunch hours, that says something.",0
"Casino is great but the security in maroon blazers are very rude, they just stand there mean looking and when you ask a simple question like where can I wait for security to bring back the ID I misplaced he rolled his eyes and said , and I quote \"" wait where they told you to wait \"" well ... That was the problem the security on the phone just asked what color shirt I was wearing, the lobby is pretty big and it was packed so I just needed to know an exact location no need for attitude by a security.",2
This is the first place for which I ever used a full publication of coupons. I am genuinely in love. \n\nMy mainstay smoothie is the health but. It's not overly sweet and is rather smooth and creamy. I feel like there is actually a good amount of sustenance behind it. Today I went with the southwest chicken salad and it far surpassed my expections. Id take a picture but it's already gone! \n\nThe island green is definitely delicious too. I have tried a few others and have enjoyed them all. The only problem I have is I wish they had different sizes of smoothie but I won't hold that against them. \n\nDespite a bit higher price than the average place I pop into for lunch TSC makes it worth it in quality and I am more than happy to write a five star review!,4
"So disappointed :(.  We were warned to watch out for companies that do not automatically come back to add freon after installation (Hendel's did not do this until we called about problems with our unit 6 months later).  I guess we should have listened.\n\nAfter problems about a year after installation, our Hendel's technical then informed us it was wired incorrectly so the system was not working properly.  3 months after our 1-year labor warranty expired, the coil bursts...and they will not cover the labor or freon related items, which adds up to a nice chunk of change (despite a history of problems). \n\nWe have been disappointed in their customer service.   You do get the feeling they would prefer you simply go somewhere else if you experience problems.  When it comes to communication, it took us a lot of effort to maintain contact and get updates from them each time we had problems.  For example, we called them for updates a few times yesterday (we cannot live in our house with 2 kids and 1 on the way, so we were hoping to get a target date for moving back) - each time we called yesterday, they expressed surprise that we had not yet heard back from them with updates (although we did always get promises of a \""call right back\"")!. \n\nI so wanted to like them and had handed out their cards to friends - their technicians seemed great - but I've since had to call those friends to take back my recommendation.\n\nWho wants to use a company that informs you your new AC was not installed correctly in the first place?  Whether it was related or not, it is disconcerting...and customer service showed no concern about improper installation since \""that's something totally different.\""",0
"When I was younger, my aunt who lived in Arizona at the time would take me here. I love going to this wonderful museum, mostly of Southwestern groups but of course that makes sense since that's the region. It was one of my favorite things to do when visiting Arizona. My Arizona trip would just not be complete without visiting the Heard Museum.\n\nThere is so much beautiful and famous artwork. Such a beautiful collection of Katsina/Kachina dolls. I loved making cornhusk dolls as a girl. I still have them to this day. It's a great place for kids and adults. I have such great childhood memories here. I haven't gone in years but checking out the website, it still looks great and I will always think of my aunt.  8.) I do plan to go back one day.",4
"Maybe I'm the outlier here but I have no idea how or why this place exists. Do they even get enough business to turn a profit? Mad props to the owner for being able to create a business out of a personal passion, it just isn't an interest we share.\n\nStore is small and exterior decor and signage is a bit tacky, IMO, but at least its distinctive? Inside you'll find everything you can possibly purchase that is related to Zombies, hence the name.\n\nThere's shirts and stickers and action figures and statues and movies and posters and various art, too. I may not understand it, but selection is large and everyone seems friendly.",1
"When I watch movies I always think about how cool it would be to sit on-set while it was being filmed. Cirque du Soleil delivers that very feeling with K\u00c0. \n\nAs they say, you can see and experience it but you won't believe it. \nThis gravity-defying production takes adventure to an all new level.\n\nFrom the warriors running and jumping from the walls around you to the rotating stage that brings you from location to location in an instant, you are left in awe.\n\n- Entertaining Storyline\n- Interesting Set Around Audience\n- Rotating Stage\n- Breathtaking Acrobatics\n- Worth Every Dollar\n\nMy wife and I scored some amazing front-row seats on the cheap and we are Cirque du Soleil geeks, so we were excited from the start. Depending on the show, sitting in the front at a Cirque can be a bad idea, but not with K\u00c0.\n\nI was looking around, wondering what the pre-show gag was going to be as there is always some level of crowd interaction. At first I thought all we were going to get was a character waling around and warriors on the wall. They ended up doing a bit where they confiscated a camera from the crowd and tossed it over the edge. It was plausible until the end when they guy dove over the edge after his camera.\n\nThe overall storyline is so over-the-top adventurous you can't help but to wonder what they will do next. The show takes you on a journey of love and conflict, set within a dynamic stage.\n\nIf you have any doubts on how good it will be, just watch the teaser trailer. \n\nWhile I had many favorite parts, I really enjoyed when the characters washed up on the beach, when they climbed up the stage to evade enemies and the rotating cages.\n\n\nWhen the characters wash-up on the shore after their boat sank they encounter fun creatures like sea turtles and crabs. The most memorable part for me however, is when the sand dumps off-stage and the characters struggle to stop from falling.\n\nDuring the climb, the characters are being chased by archers and and warriors in choreographed movements up a wall. The stage is constantly rotating and lifting while people fall off-stage. There are arrows being shot at them and then used for footholds. Amazing.\n\nNear the end there is a rotating slave cage scene where you witness many gravity-defying feats. As the program explains it \""The two artists balance and control the spinning of the apparatus from their opposing cages attached to the center axle. As one runs and jumps on the outside of one cage the other controls the speed by walking or running inside the other cage.\"" This took a lot of skill and the artists didn't trip-up once. Seamless.",4
Their homemade tortillas and salsa rock!  The plates dishes are a bit greasy so we switched to the ala carte meals which are much better in my opinion.  Love their potato & bean burrito.  Don't expect fancy but do expect to pay less.  Always bustling crowds in here so grab a seat after ordering.,3
We found this amazing bistro through a friend that's a local and we are so glad we did!! Every time we come into town we make it a point to go there to enjoy a delicious dinner! The garlic bread is to die for and we have never had a bad meal or experience! We have had to wait a bit for a table but it's so worth the wait we didn't mind at all.,4
"I got a quote from Gary,\nThe price seemed reasonable so my wife and I decided to move forward with the project.\nI just head back from Gary ,\nTurns out there's a 335$ difference between the original quote and the price we will now have to pay.\nI find this very unprofessional,\nOnce you give a quote you stick with it.\nI know this first hand as a contractor.\n I would accept a 100-200$ difference but not 335$!!\n .\nThey're supposed to see if they can arrange something,and if they do I will update my review.",0
"This place was to do my wedding cupcakes.  Unfortunately, (or fortunately for me anyway) I ended up cancelling my wedding.  I called the place 4 months in advance to cancel my order.  I called for a couple of days straight and could only  get the answering machine. which said they were closed for vacation.  Eventually I left a message informing them my wedding was cancelled and I needed to cancel my order and requested a return call.  Upon their return from vacation, I was told because I did not leave the message within a specific amount of time, I was going to be charged a percentage of my order total.  I was really put off by that, especially because they were on vacation anyway.  It's not like they were in the kitchen making my order 4 months in advance.  But, whatever, if that's what I signed in the contract, fine, they got me.  \nNow, here's the kicker!!!   The lady asks me, \""why did you cancel the wedding?\""  I reply, \""That's none of your business.\""  She then asks me, \""well, do you still talk to the man?\""  Again, I reply, \""That's none of your business.\""  She says, \""well, we need to know because you are required to submit to us a notarized letter stating that you are not getting married to each other and you have not signed a contract with another bakery.\""  You have got to be kidding me!!!!!  I did it only because I did not want them to charge me anymore money.  I will never go back to this place ever again.  Brides, stay away!!!",0
"Let's call this a 3.5, here's why: \n\nPros\n-Day time front desk staff was friendly and speedy. I was in and out in 20 mins and that was without an appointment. \n-Good specials sent out via email. \n\nCons\n-PM front desk staff was frustratingly disorganized. They called and told me my pet would be ready by 5:45, I arrived at 6:45 and did not leave with my dog until almost 8p. As lovely as your office is, the last thing I want to do is wait in it for over an hour. Please finish charting before you tell me to pick up my pup. \n-Constant upselling by doctor and front desk staff. I understand this is a business but it gets uncomfortable beyond the second \""no thank you\"". \n\nMy pup was seemingly well cared for so, I'd recommend them to friends and family with a warning that the discharge process isn't smooth but worth the wait.",2
"If I could give no stars I would.  $800 for one pair of glasses that I can't use.  The measuring camera outfit is smoke & mirrors.  My wife had the same experience with her $1000 glasses.  Emailed them and they thanked me for my feedback and said they were \""sorry.\""  If you have money to throw away, and don't care if you can see with your new glasses,  then this is the place to go!!!",0
"I was expecting great deals, but overall Copenhagen can be pricey.  The staff is very friendly, even offering me water!  The furniture they have is mostly incomplete.  Sectionals without the rest of the couch.  One bar stool.  There are more desks than anything else, but is probably ideal if you'd like to add to your already existing copenhagen furniture piece, and if they have that addition available.",2
"I came here after a weekend of fun in Vegas, hoping to have some amazing food.. but I was extremely disappointed. . I ordered two tostadas one ceviche de pescado and a ceviche de camaron, with a side of two empanadas de camaron. . The food was very plain and bland no flavor .. And the service was horrible they took forever to take our order and even longer to bring out our food. the only good thing about this place was the live music.",0
I was treated very poorly by management.,0
"I got my first & only tattoo here nearly 6 years ago.  I was nervous but they put me at ease and worked the design out on paper many times until I was 100% satisfied and ready to go forward.  I originally wanted something tiny and in white ink but they said they don't use white alone because it bleeds and fades, and they don't do super tiny text.  I respect the fact that they don't compromise the quality and instead stick with what works.  My tattoo healed beautifully and 5 years later it still looks great.  My tattoo is on my foot and I taught swimming lessons and continue to swim and it never faded despite the sun exposure.  James did my tattoo, don't know if he is still there or not.  \n\nThe shop is expensive but tattoos are something you should never, ever go cheap on.",4
"Fresh...not! Went here years ago when they first opened and was impressed. In the neighborhood and remembered them so decided to try again. Major disappointment. The dish I remember best no longer on menu. Order beef chimi. Yuck! Filled with unseasoned ground beef and covered with what looked like (and tasted worse than\"" Cheez-Wiz..",0
"I've been here a few times now and each time has been consistent. This is a decent place with interesting burger combos and eclectic decor. \n\nMy most recent burger there was \""la boeuf,\"" which was a patty, melted cheddar cheese and jalape\u00f1os. Sounds simple enough, but it was actually pretty delicious. Like Taco Bell without the pain. I always go for the sweet potato fries and the spicy mayo, both fantastic. \n\nI've had some not so memorable items off the menu too: their Mac n cheese and grilled cheeses are very basic. Nothing special about them at all.\n\nI've tried a cocktail off their menu too. I'm not a cocktail guy, and this place certainly didn't convert me. It was a whisky ginger with some leaves in it and probably a syrup too. Too sweet. \n\nAll in all, this place has a very good selection of burgers and I never hesitate to suggest this place when looking for a bite in Laval.",3
"Meh. \n\nIt's ok. \n\nI come here because I work close by. I usually need a grilled chicken breast of sorts. Maybe some vegetables. It's usually because I am too lazy to prepare a proper lunch.\n\nThe thing that sucks about this place is that they usually douse everything in teriyaki sauce which is loaded with sugar, so make sure to get it on the side.\n\nAlso, if you just want the protein, you are still stuck having to spend 6-8 bucks on the whole damn bowl. You can't just buy a side of chicken breast. What an inconvenient truth. Al Gore would not approve.\n\nThere really isn't anything special about this place. It's grilled chicken, beef or salmon over rice. With teriyaki sauce. Big freaking deal. I'd rather make my own lunch.\n\nNEXT!",1
"The worst hotel experience of my life!\n\nMy boyfriend and i travel a lot due to his line of work, and honestly this is the worst experience we have ever had. We were in town with many other hotels guests (including the bride/groom) for a wedding and all stayed here. Our original room was located in the basement, which was very hard to find, scary, and felt like a dungeon. The room itself had minimal lighting and a damp basement odor. I was very uncomfortable and we could hear noises throughout the room, we notified the front desk of our dissatisfaction with the room and were told we could switch rooms in the morning. My bf ended up getting into an arguement with the staff that next morning as they denied the room switch when he went to get our new keys. After much back and forth they finally agreed to switch our room to one that was not in the basement, but this room had it's own set of issues. The rooms are very big and nicely decorated but that is about all the you get with you stay here. The hotel staff was extremely rude, our new room had broken lightbulbs which they did not fix. Our other friends room did not have a working AC /Heat, the kitchen area of the room is missing basic kitchenware, the dishwasher comes with no dishsoap, and there is no extra toilet paper/towels/blanket/pillow. Every time you use the shower you have to walk to the front desk to get another towel. This hotel is fairly expensive nightly so we thought some accommodations would be able to be made, especially for a group of our size there for such a special occasion, but everyone was very hard to deal with. We realized the bride and groom were also dissatisfied as their suite did not even have closet space for the brides dress or anything else. Another couple also had to be moved due to their room condition as well.  The housekeeping is sporatic, one day they came and one day they did not. When asked for them to come clean on the day they missed we were told they went home for the day and it was just the afternoon. It was overall a really horrible experience. All guests that were in town for this wedding that stayed at this hotel had issues, including the bride/groom, it was not just us. We would never recommend this hotel to anyone and ALL left saying how bad of an experience we had and how unhelpful the staff was. Never again!",0
"Yelp really needs to allow negative ratings.\n\n\nI've been there a total of three times now. The lady watiress/owner, from the first time she TALKED, I already knew she was a rude one. However, it's an Asian place so it's expected. So I ignored her attitude, ignored her snide/not-so-funny comments, and just ate my food because that's what I went for. Plus I always go with a group of 6 or more people so I always have my friends to chat with and make jokes with. That way, her little signs of lowering my standards won't be so annoying. \n\n\nBut our recent trip was, by far, the worst. THE WORST. I don't think I've ever been treated this poorly in any Asian restaurant. And trust me, I've been to plenty. \n\n\nI wasn't really feeling all that well and that's why my friends were willing to go to pho instead of the originally planned ramen shop. Bad idea. I think my stomach would've preferred the thick ramen soup. \n\n\nThe wait for water/soda: 40+ minutes\nThe wait for pho: 1 hour and then some\n\n\nThe wait for the food was so long that my stomach had begun hurting before the food got here. And even when the food DID get here, the food did not help cause the damage was already done. So instead of sitting back and relaxing in contentment of a full stomach, I was busy cringing in pain. Who the shit serves pho an hour after the order? \n\nSo my boyfriend brought me a bottle of vitamin c tablets for me to take prior to everything. It was a new bottle, so all the plastic wrapping and cotton inside was put on the table cause where else are we going to put it? So what did the owner say when she took our orders?\n\n\""CLEAN UP YOUR MESS PLEASE.\""\n\n\nTHE FUCK, LADY? You think YOU won't have to clean up the mess AFTER we eat? Or what? We eat and WE CLEAN the TABLE FOR YOU BEFORE WE GO? The shit?\n\n\nNeedless to say, we didn't tip much and got a sarcastic comment from her because of it. \""THANKS FOR THE HUGE TIP!! You're so GENEROUS!\"" Then she repeated it as we were walking out the door. Why do I have to tip you if you're going to take an hour to bring out pho? ONE HOUR. ONE HOUR. ONE HOUR. LET ME REPEAT. ONE HOUR. I normally can get in and out of a restaurant in one hour, not wait for water and food for an hour. \n\n\nOh, the food wasn't anything that special either.\n\n\nBut yeah, I suppose you can blame us for not leaving asap but I was trying to not to be rude to people and in front of my friends. Normally I don't have a problem with waiting cause we're in a big group and we always have a lot to talk about but this was a little bit too much. It was one of those:\n\n\nHey, it's a lil long but maybe it'll be here soon. .. to\nWe've already been here this long -_- might as well.",0
"A private social club located just off the Capitol square...and thus frequent host of politically oriented events.  \n\nHits: Discrete, courteous staff who provide professional service without being irritating. \n\nMisses: Could stand a carpet face lift and some general updating. Luncheon options range from mediocre to standard social club fare: read, not much \""wow\"" factor. \n\nHints: The basement level is huge and more modern than the main floor. Monday's offers non-members (like me) a chance to sample what the club has to offer.  \n\nMidwest reminder:  They do not allow jeans (although not strictly enforced).\n\nThe web page lists reciprocity with other clubs for visitors.",2
"Once was in the Barrio, now in the boardroom  fortunately.  I made it out, but the memories of where I came from and where I am have never left and remind me daily of the difference between success and failure. \n\nBefore I go on too long, the bottom line is I would recommend taking a pass on Barrio Queen.  Prices are a bit steep based upon the quality and presentation of the food. \n\nI also found the staff a bit pretentious in asking if I wanted change from my $100.00 bill for a $52.00 check. \n\nI note this because conceptually Barrio Queen tries to make the right choices for the most part. but comes up a bit short, as in the narrow difference between success and failure. \n\nBarrio Queen is conveniently located.  When my wife, daughter and I dined the restaurant was clean with attractive decor and intriguing menu items.  The one issue I have though with \""trendy\"" Mexican restaurants is the use of black beans and the omission of pinto or other types of beans historically consumed by natives of Mexico and Central America.  We were told by the server that the restaurant does not serve rice and only black beans true to native Mexico. \n\nI found that a bit odd based upon my knowledge, travel and consumption of Mexican and Latin American foods based upon many factors, including travel throughout Central and South America. \n\nI found the tacos to be decent but with no sauce to add to compliment the presentation and the guacamole to have 1/4 avocado size chunks (perhaps intentionally) with minimal flavor. \n\nThe one thing Latin food should have is flavor.  Some of my best meals have been in dives and dumpy looking restaurants.  Unfortunately, Barrio Queen comes up short in the food category, beautiful setting but below average cuisine and certainly not worth the price.",1
"Oh, L&L. Heaven in a styrofoam box. The happiest place on earth? For me, when kicking back on a Friday night with my man and a few episodes of Mad Men, it sure is. The staff are friendly and aren't at all shy--if you're new to the joint or just haven't tried many things on the menu, they'll guide you (and give darn good advice). \n\nA few of my faves: Mixed BBQ plate, Mixed Curry BBQ plate. And I'm a two scoops macaroni, one scoop rice gal. \n\nDrop by if you're in the neighborhood (or if you're on another planet)--you'll be a regular in no time.",4
"Typical food for cracker barrel,. Service is usually pretty good, however today was poor. Several employees standing around talking loudly, all while we waited for 5 min. to be seated in a near empty restaurant. Almost walked out!",1
All of Prince and the time greatest hits. Acts switch out every couple of songs. Guy looks like and sounds like Prince! We bought tickets from tix4tonight for $33 the day of show. Venue was probably 75% full on a Saturday night. They are more expensive from ticketmaster. Performance is interactive with standing singing and dancing. Sometimes music was too loud so i couldnt hear the words although i knew the songs anyway. I would recommend.,3
We had to wait quite a bit for a table but once we got seated the food came out pretty fast. My friend and I ordered the chocolate chip banana hotcakes and Gail's famous eggs to share. The hotcakes were good as usual but I think it's over hyped. I didn't really like the eggs at all. It was creamier but it had this weird taste to it that I didn't like. We also got a side of bacon which was eh. We asked for the potatoes to be extra crispy and that definitely makes them so much better!,2
"Decided to check out this venue again after it switched hands ..... I have to say that the improvements are great! \n\nThe decor is the same.... the live music is still great.... came to see mojo risin', always a good time!  \n\nThe improvements ..... \n1) more wait staff! Always a must when you have a packed place and live music! Our waitress was right on top of things and my glass was never empty, always a good sign!\n2) The menu! I loved the garlic knots, and the prices are reasonable. I have to come back and try the pizza, I've heard its great!\n\nAll in all.... a good time was had! I will be back!",2
"Fantastic food, service, and experience.  Will return regularly, as often as I get to town. \n\nChilaquiles are fantastic.  Outstanding menu with sweet, savory, healthy if u r so inclined.  Next time, it's the fried chicken and waflles or is it the corn beef hash or an omelet.  So many decisions.  I'll have to come back again (and again, and again).  Service couldn't be better, and with a smile.  Well done Over Easy, well done.",4
"I love Ian's. Having moved to Madison from the Northeast, where pizza-by-the slice is a staple, I was thrilled when Ian's arrived on the scene. I am also very happy for Ian and how well his business is thriving. I am familiar with Ian's conceptual mothership, Antonio's Pizza in Amherst, Massachusetts, so I appreciate inventive pizza. I know Ian's caters to its Midwest, beer-guzzling undergrad crowd with mac 'n' cheese and other heavy slices like the shepherd's pie. But I love Ian's for its 'fresher' recipes, such as black bean-avocado-feta and the kalamata olive tapenade- based mediterranean slices. Lately, I have been somewhat disappointed by the limited availability of these 'fresher' options and especially by the designation of certain of these as \""seasonal.\"" I wonder if Ian would consider resurrecting perhaps one of these recipes at a time to rotate throughout the off-seasons. Regardless, Ian's is my favorite quick-eat near campus.",3
"Tried Sicilian style pizza, baked ziti and breaded eggplant. The pizza was very good heated up nice the next day. The baked ziti was good, but sauce seemed plain. The eggplant was good, mushrooms seemed rubbery. The server was good. The hostess was very interested in our opinion of the food. We liked the food except for the mushrooms. I tend to like oregano and basil in my sauce but some people may prefer less herbs in their sauce. Overall, atmosphere very good as are the staff.",3
"This place was a pleasant surprise.  We were originally planning on eating at the M Buffet, but we arrived in Vegas a couple hours late, so we were no longer able to fit it in our schedule.  We were staying at Forum Towers at Caesars, so we decided eat somewhere close.  I'm glad that we decided to do so, otherwise we may never have given this place a try.\n\nFirst off, the prices are a bit high.  So it's definitely not somewhere to go if you're looking to save some money.  But it's also not so high that your wallet will want to punch you in the mouth.  But it's Vegas, so you should expect to spend a bit more money than you would at home.\n\nI don't know if I've ever spent ~$20 on Fettucini Alfredo before coming to Trevi, but the pasta was damn good!  So I definitely came away satisfied.  My wife got the stuffed eggplant, and we shared the crab, spinach & artichoke dip.  We enjoyed everything.  The cheese was amazing on the stuffed eggplant, so I think I'm going to try their lasagna next time.\n\nThe ambience was also really great.  We sat near the fountain which was really cool, and we were able to people watch.\n\nThere was also no wait on Friday night at 9pm.  So that was very convenient for us since we were meeting up with friends later that night.\n\nWe really enjoyed our dinner at Trevi, and we'll definitely be dining here again.",3
"I'm a vegetarian so there are not too many places I go to eat. I went to this place and tried their veggie turkey sandwich. It took about two hours for the nausea and stomach pains to start. I don't know, maybe food poisoning? I bet there are not a lot of veggies eating there so maybe the soy turkey was old and bad? It's the next morning and my esophagus and stomach are on fire. I can't eat or drink anything. Ouch.",0
"I got this hotel through Priceline for about $55/night.  It is off-strip and about 3-4 miles away from the airport.  The hotel definitely has a modern feeling to it ... the decor was elegant and polished.  I was really impressed upon arriving!  Check-in was pain-free ... it took literally about 3 minutes for me to check in.  The front desk was very professional, nice, and courteous.  I stayed there during their 5 year anniversary celebration, so I was given a card that had a prize for me waiting inside.  Turns out, I got a certificate for \""Buy 2 for the price of 1 appetizer\"" at their Envy restaurant.  Too bad I didn't get to use it!\n\nThe hotel room was also a reflection of the hotel lobby itself.  It is very modern and sleek.  I really liked it!  They had one guest robe and a big desk for you to sit at to do some work.  The bathroom has a separate tub as well as a separate shower stall.  The only complaint about the hotel room is that it didn't have a lock on its door.  Rather, it is a sliding door.  I personally like to have a bathroom door with a lock on it, but it's not too much of a big deal.  \n\nThe bed was very comfortable and all white. Simple, modern, clean.  \n\nWhen I am in Vegas, I like to stay off-strip and in hotels that do not have casinos.  This, as well as the Trump Hotel, are definitely great hotels to stay at if you prefer these as well.  Definitely recommend.",3
